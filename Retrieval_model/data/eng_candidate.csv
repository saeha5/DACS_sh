Was this a friend you were in love with or just a best friend?
Where has she gone?
Oh was this something that happened because of an argument?
Oh ya? I dont really see how
I do actually hit blank walls a lot of times but i get by
Wait what are sweatings
doing good.. how about you
its quite strange that you didnt imagine it
And thats something you should never do good on you. 
What do you mean it hasnt been easy? How close have you come to cheating? 
Dont be nervous. Just be prepared.
Yes but if you stay calm it will be ok.
Sounds great! So whats your major?
Well pleased. You should be having brainsman!Thats a tough coursei hear.
I am sorry to hear that. Did it happen out of the blue?
I am sorry to hear that. I hope it turned out to be a blessing in decise.
Wow that must be terrible I cannot imagine I lvoe christmas
Wow I am sorry to hear that I wish I could make it a better holiday for you!
I work remotely I wish that you could do something like that as well.
Sometimes in life it is not about performance. Some people just get a shiner spoon.
Thats a sweet man I hope you acknowledged his kind gesture. 
Their arent that many well rounded people in the world these days so when you see one you should always show appreciation! 
I am sorry to hear that. I hope you find a better opportunity. Did you know why they rejected you?
WOW! Did it do any damage?
That is great. I would have been scared to death. Was it recent?
haha yeah that would be very bad !
Oh no  sorry to hear that happened to you 
What happened for you to feel that way?
Oh that does sound terrible. What did you guys decide to do?
Thats very scary. I hope no one got hurt.
So happy everyone was fine!! Everything else can be fixed.
So good to hear. Might want to trim some trees lol
I saw that game. They won on penalty kicks!
It was very tense. The other game with England and Sweden was not nearly as nervewracking.
It must be so frustrating to have to answer the same thing over and over. Is she older?
My aunt does the same thing! I think what she is doing is accidentally deleting texts and she doesnt understand how to check her contacts list. What do you think is happening with your coworker?
What is the problem with the engine?
Sorry to hear that. I hope you find what is the problem with the engine.
I felt sad and depressed due to my insecurities and felt rejected from society
The problem is I dont think you can grew out of my specific insecurity.
Im not familiar with abseiling but Im glad that you felt good about it.
Oh I see. No Ive never done that.
Hello! I am in such a good mood since I got my new home.
I have a ton of backyard space that we have plans for. Camping would be a fun one.
I want to look in to getting a nice fire pit for the house.
What kind of house are you building? 
That sounds great. What are you most excited for? 
Why did you feel guilty for taking a drink?
I can understand. I am not a big drinker myself but I wouldnt feel guilty about it.  Not unless you promised someone you wouldnt drink.
Oh yea I can understand that then... Well I am sure you learned your lesson right?
Yeah that sounds really sad. I am sorry for what you went through. 
Yeah maybe that was a good decision that you made. 
wow that was so awesome of them!
I had to buy my first car and it wasnt until I was 21 that I could afford it. 
That is where I am still at I am scared I will have regrets when I get older
That is good I am glad you have no regrets!
what was the topic
Im not familiar with him where is he from
and how did you learn about him
Yes I think that everyone does! What about you?
Thats too bad. Our janitor is very friendly.
Is it not better you replace it with same type of statuetteat a grocery store?
The mother of your grand mother that means your great grand mother ! Well you can search through her archives
It is very bad service. What did you do? Did you complain to the manager?
That would be hard to do and take courage. 
I could see that happening but sounds like you were super brave.
Oh my what happened?
I live near the ocean so I do understand how this can be. I hope you ran very quickly.
I heard a story of seagulls drowning a man to death.
I was the same way.
Lol. I take away my daughters now. I guess my mom passed the torch.
She is 13 not at 3am
What promise didnt he keep?
Wow that sounds like a terrible friend.  I hope he had a good reason for not showing up.
Wow. Did he have kids?
Ah ok. Good you stayed committed to your wife.
That is very inspiring Im glad you take the extra time. Do you like doing what you do?
That is awesome thanks for taking the time to help kids grasp a new language! You deserve to be appreciated but Im sure they appreciate you a lot.
That is heartbreaking its always helped me to remember that no matter what happens you have your memories with them.
Absolutely its a chapter of your life and as long as you have those memories they live on through those memories.
Im sorry to hear that.  That must have been frustrating.
Hopefully you were able to get the ice cream that you wanted in the following days.
Oh no! Glad your dad was able to help. How did it happen?
Thats some bad luck. I hope it wasnt too much of a hassle.
Awe how sweet I bet those are good memories
I agree with that for sure. 
I bet! That sounds like fun.
What sweet memories to hold on to.
Thats awesome! How helpful where the other people so that you could enjoy your trip?
Must have been super fun. How were the local people? How did they treat you?
Thats great! Im glad that they took care of you! Have a gret day!
Im sorry to hear that. Do you know what caused it?
Ive done that to myself before. Now I always wait awhile to sleep after eating.
What were you afraid of? 
Oh No well glad to see you are here still! 
what is your job position?
Thats very bad
What did you do? 
Ouch... Is it just for a day? Is your friend a safe driver?
Yes... If this makes you feel better.. I lent my car to a friend for a week and thank goodness everything was alright. 
Haha my girlfriend does the same thing.  Check comes in and she is so happy to have money for the next two weeks then goes and spends it all on clothing and accessories.  
We all deserve to treat ourselves every now and then.
Yeah its really frustrating when they wont have more eople on. 
Exactly. Hopefully more places will get selfcheckout so we can get through the line faster. 
Yeah or at least do something to correct that.
or hire more people maybe also
They dont spend money unless they absolutely have to. They get bonuses for saving money I think
And then what?
I understand that must suck
Thats terrible... have you gotten a new phone yet? 
Thats true but I hope some good luck comes your way soon..
oh well where did you move?
wow!! wonderful isnt!! you would have been over the moon once you moved..
Oh no thats terrible. Sorry you had to deal with that.
I am sure that threw a wrench in your plans. How frustrating!
whats your favorite food? that was very nice of them
oh nice im afraid the most asian food that i like is fortune cookies
That will mess you up for a few days. The only thing I dont like about going away.
Oh no. Hopefully everybody gets back to normal soon.
I only like yard work with the kids. They do most of the work and we have fun in the dirt.
Oh no. The shower is the plus side to all the dirt I guess. I once found a snake digging a hole to plant a flower. I quit that day.
Oh my gosh! I would have been so upset! Nothing is better than chocolates on a bad day.
Thats definitely better than nothing. I hope your days have been better since!
Thats so special! What a beautiful moment.. How old is she? 
My daughter is 1.5 years old  shes just been introduced to the water.. its always so special when our babies have their first moments. Congrats mama! 
Have  you thought about talking to your boss about it?
You should still speak to him about your concerns.
This is terrible. So sad to hear that. What did you do then?
Did she already move out?
What do you mean? I dont know what you are talking about.
Well then I guess you should have went and checked to see if anyone was hurt. I hope you called a ambulance.
I would have gotten out right then I believe.
I guess you rolled all the windows down too and held your breath
Wao that sound like a great strong realtionship you have with her so glad to hear that!
When my first daugther was born! i saw in new life i thought everything in the world can change we need to be pure as kids.
When i see them i believe thiw world in which we live fill with envy and hate can be rewed
Thats good that you found the keychain
thats very good! Always nice to find those old lost items.  
That is seriously the worst... waiting around all day wondering whats going on! Have you tried calling him today? 
Of course right I would try angies list or homeadvisor! They can find you a new one...
Oh no. I am sure he will get caught eventually though.
Things you do usually come back to you . 
What event was taking place?
Thats cool you were on stage for that. Were you one of the musicians?
Oh yeah what are you doing for your vacation? 
Sounds rather special to me! Out of the country or to another state? 
That is great. It is sweet to see them grow and learn. How old is she?
Funny one ha ha
It is so sweet. Is she able to talk?
That should be funny to see and hear
That sucks... what was he or she supposed to help you with? 
Well I hope you two can talk it out express your feelings and work it out together! Friendship is hard to come by these days... 
Traveling is hard work. Where did you go?
Wow. I have never neen that far! I have been to the Caribbean though.
Thats awesome friends really can be the best. How long have you known them? 
Im glad you have such good friends in your life it makes life easier. 
Omg... thats terrible! Im so sorry  Ive been through similar. Are they going to give you some sort of money upon lay off? 
If they have a heart or soul they will! They really should...
That is really cool! Did they tell you why they were giving you the bonus?
Well at least you get something to look forward too at work.
What was it. Ive been too busy to notice new movies out.
They do put out good movies most of the time. I will try and check it out. 
What are they doing to cause you to think that?
I have heard that too. You might want to contact your local district.
No problem I hope everything works out
Happy Birthday!!!! What are you going to do for it? 
I hope you get lots and lots! 
Oh no! Bugs really creep me out!
what did the landlor do about it? Did you have to call an exterminator?
Ugh.. that seems like forever away.. can you try to get it sooner? 
Maybe consider looking for a new job in the meantime? Never hurts to stay ahead.. 
That is nice. I like going to water park. What time are you going?
Is it a big water park?
Are you ok you have to tell me what happened.
Ahh that has happened to everyone before. It is embarrassing but you will get over it.
Well im glad you were able to cover up.
Oh no. That must have been scary.
Wow. I wouldve freaked. I cant even have all of the lights out in my apartment.
Glad a bear didnt eat you
How long have you been trying to sell it for?
Im sure you will sell it soon! 3 months is not such a long time
Did you wait a lot?
Ah ok Congratulation
Shame on them.
You should report him. Anonymously. You shouldt have to deal with that every day.
Oh no thats scary is she okay?
Thats good Im glad it wasnt serious.
What are they doing that is upsetting you?
Have you made a formal complaint against them yet?
You should report it to your local police department. Building and documenting this can help you.
That happens a lot. What happened next?
I know the feeling. I hate driving now. Everyone is looking in their phone.
I thnk the driving age should be raised to 21 personally
Please tell me that he was friendly and nothing creepy! 
Thank god! LOL I was like please tell me this was a positive experience... 
That would pretty amazing. What will you do with the winning?
I think the same really. Making sure everything is paid off having a roof over your head etc... is what most people would want to take caer of first.
Good for you! Studying can be a real challenge sometimes.
Awesome thats the best way to go into exam. Im sure youll do great!
That is great. Probably he think that you are doing a great job.
That is good
Thats awful Im sorry to hear that. I lost my job once as well and times got really hard. What kind of stuff are you doing to try and avoid that outcome?
Well at the time I was holding out for a similar paying job like I had before but I could not find one and I ended up working fast food. I had to downsize my place as well.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY! Do you have any plans for today?
That is really cool Where did you guys on your trip?
I live in Texas so that it really close to me
Oh no. Thats not right.
Lol. Why didnt you just reschedule?
So you said you were going out of town. Thats hilarious.
wow! Thats awesome! Did you accept the job offer?
yes i understand. sometimes you just get a gut feeling that something isnt right
Bummer!!! Are you looking for a work at home job or just an outside job? 
I hear ya.. I hope you find one soon... wishing you all of the best! 
I do that all of time.
Lol. Poor Max. I bet sometimes dogs wished the spoke English for that very reason.
Shame on you. Im telling
O wow that is a long time Are you happy with it?
Im sorry to hear that sometimes people grow apart. You should try to throw a party and see who comes.
congratulations! I know it probably feels lonely. Maybe you should do a party at your house and invite all the neighbours
you cant go wrong with some grilled food  burgers wings hot dogs 
I would have went running like forest gump  what did you do? 
Going to have to burn the whole house down now and move... LOL just joking! 
Oh no. Did they say why?
Hopefully it might be reconsidered later on.
Is she ok? Im glad you were close by!
That is really cool of you to do Did anyone else see it happen?
Thats terrible. Employers just dont value their employees sometimes.
I hope so too. Have you considered working elsewhere?
Oh no... were they relaxed about it or did it cause a problem? 
Well glad they didnt freak out on you some people arent as understanding. I bet it was pricey. 
Why is that?
Well I just bought a great bathing suit that covers up all the extras but still shows a little skin and makes me feel good. Maybe that will work for you.
Thats good to hear. Where did you get it from?
I gotcha. I bought mine online too. 
oh no sorry to hear that. I just lost mine in November. Its hard.
People say it gets easier. Im still waiting for that part.
I hope so. Nice chatting with you.
I hear ya. Anyway to get a new job?
Got ya. What kind of work do you currently do?
I dont like rude people either did you tell him? 
Oh god.. give it a few days and then try to sort it out! 
Oh yeah I am sure it is.. have you talked to them about paying for it? 
That really sucks.. i guess all you can do is get a metal type of fence or maybe one with spikes!  lol  
Wow! Have you been to many places?
Ive been in the same place. DC and then its neighbor MD.
MY brothers are the same way. At least yours ginally came around.
two younger ones. They only call when they want something. my older sister is the same. Im the good one.
Happy Birthday! Is the call from the ex a good or bad thing?
Exes are exes for a reason I guess lol.
Thats not good. I know my eyes hurt when staring at the bright white screen on computers . So I change them to a darker color when possible.
Havent tried that yet but I have heard of it. I will check it out. thanks !
Nostalgia. Is there another HS nearby for the kids to go to?
Thats pretty terrible. Thirty minutes in a day pretty much just commuting one way. School is already tough.
Aw thats so nice how did she surprise you? 
Cakes! yessss winning.  
Thats too bad. What happened?
Thats horrible. Sorry to hear.
Awesome! Happy Birthday to you! Where are you going? 
That seriously sounds like the best birthday ever... i hope you guys have an awesome time. 
Did you get hit my it? I bet that was scary.
Im glad you are ok How is your community.
Wow thats awesome. I went back at 31. Still going.
I am studying Criminal Justice now. Hopefully I will be done soon.
Did you go through a breakup recently?
Happy Birthday! Well you can order out of course. 
What happened to him? How are they doing?
That is understanable I would be the same way.
Oh man. What happened?
Did you end up getting a ticket?
That is a nice thing you are doing for her though. Maybe you could hire somebody for a few hours a week and join a gym or yoga class. 
Go to a walking path or park. Maybe to a dog park also. 
Cant always help unfortunately. I hope the little guy made it too!
I wonder how they get all the way to the road away from the other turtles!
I am sorry to hear that.. is there any physical therapy that can help her? 
Usually moving your body helps but it depends on her situation... i would get a 2nd opinion!
How many hours do you have left?
haha not bad! where are you going on vacation?
Thats great was the result good?
Thats great. How happy were you?
Did it bite you? Are you ok?
Im glad you are ok. Some of those are poisonous and can kill.
Wow Thats amazing. You must be very proud of her.  I think coding etc seems very hard.
Very inspirational story. They make good money too.
Thats amazing! How do you anticipate dealing with people who are afraid of needles?
Thats good thinking. I hope you wont get too many who are afraid!
Thats good. Make sure you follow up.
Thats great. Would this be a good job?
Good luck! I hope youll win!
Well you never know. Its nice to think what you can do with the money though.
Im so sorry to hear that. How sad for you.
Did he ditch you as well? And how did the girlfriend react?
Very nice! Where was the party?
Thats really sweet of them. Mustve been a big party.
Thats so terrible!  Im really sorry... you should do something special everyday and make memories! 
It really doesnt.. i had to put my dog to sleep and it was extremely painful. I really hope that he can rest without pain and that you can feel better soon.. 
Did you tell your spouse? I really think they should know.
Some would consider it cheating if you did not tell them.
I know what you mean... but for now maybe you can just car pool around with your friend until you can get one! 
So you can ride in style for free. Sounds fair to me.. until you get yours!  
oh no. Im sorry to hear that.
I dont. My apartment wont allow but we are moving soon I hope to get a cat.
Oh I bet that was fun and interesting visiting another country too.
I like to try different types of food from other places too. Then try to make them later on.
That can be stressful. I hope you get the sale. What will you do afterwards?
Do you prefer the isolation?
Awesome! Where are you headed to? 
OMG!!!!! That sounds amazing! Its going to be epic. I hope you have a great time. 
Thats really considerate of you. Do they need your help a lot?
Wow. Home selling can be tough. I hope that debt clears up real soon!
Thats sucks. You just have to warm up to people.
I would be so scared to move to a new place. I commend you. Itll get better
Oh no. Did you end up having to leave the cart?
Do you usually get a live one ?
Just a small fake one. Some people get really into decorating. I dont really like it. 
That sucks..... always bad to see something like that. Did you atleast enjoy your trip? 
Aw thats good! Im glad you still had a good time. 
surprise party or intervention
How sweet! I hope someone throws me one one day.
That is exciting and scary all at the same time
I could understand that Does she know anyone at her new school?
life was simple then wasnt it! very cute. 
I know what you mean. I miss being little myself. 
Oh no that is not good
Did you finally find it
Thats gotta be terrible. Why did they pick him instead of you?
Im sorry to hear. Will you have another chance to get promoted?
O im sorry to hear that! How did it happen?
Does he not have a chance to regain his eyesite?
What a beautiful memory that you will always have though... have you tried to be friends again? 
I get it.. but you know life really is too short.. i think you should try to reach out! Do it!  
Oh no. Guess they have finally reached that rebellious age. What did you do?
I have no idea what that is.
Oh is it and action movie.
What did you do with it? Did you try to kill it?
Thats what I would have done. Did they get it taken care of?
O No! Are they going to offer you any kind of package?
Im sorry to hear that. Maybe you should contact your HR and see what your options are
How is it looking? 
There you go! Thats awesome.. i really wish we had a garage. lol lucky!
OF course. Pets are family.
What charities do you like to give too
That is a very nice thing to do I wish I could do more to help.
I just put all my change in a giant bottle.
I hope someone turns it in soon to you.. did you lose out on money too? 
Yeah a real pain honestly... im sorry that happened to you.  
Did you buy tickets or win them?
What game did they win?
Really? I dont recall that at all. I remember them choking. I could be wrong.
That sucks. Are you ok?
Thats good. Did the clocks all reset?
I bet that was rather fun how fast did you get it going? 
Wow! You are crazy ha ha  i probably would have had a panic attack at 90MPH. p
Thats great.I  change my oil all the time.
Yes my dad taught me also.
Try online dating! Its actually really fun... have you tried it? 
Dont feel that way... theres someone out there for everyone. Give it a try.  
Were you able to get her help in time! How is she doing?
That is good to hear! Yeah situations like that can be really alarming.
Thats not right. How did you feel?
Thats good. How did you do?
Im sorry to hear that. Was it from age or complications?
Yeah that is not good. But everyone does have a time to go you know?
were you afraid of the dark?
i slept in my moms room because i was always afraid of the dark
Did she land?
Sweet. Did the crowd cheer?
Wow that is great! When are you going to start?
That is really great! How does that make you feel?
Why dont you say something?
That isnt nice.
oh gosh me too!! especially the clown from the movie IT
i slept with a light on for a couple of night lol
That sounds really nice! Did you stay near the ocean?
I remember throwing food over and watching them catch it as a kid.
What did it say?
That is so sweet. Give him twenty dollars. 
I bet he would love that.
oh no  maybe you should confess and im sure you will feel better
i understand. maybe next time you shouldnt cheay
Sorry to hear that.
Yes. I have lost my grandma.
That is a terrible thing to happen Im sure...
Im happy that you are still here as well! Think of the alternative 
Nice how was the water.
Thats funny. Did you get them all?
Mw too. I dont even llike when its too dark inside or outside.
Maybe we are ghosts.
I live in Texas We really dont have to worry about them here.
Texas is a great place! But I can understand the need to want to be prepared.
Cool. What kind of car.
That is terrible does it smell?
You should tell someone.
I think its my turn to win the lottery
Sure Thats sounds like a real plan. lol
what did he do?
yes i can see how it can bbe annoying
awww. dont tell anyone but my son is my favorite child. I have two girls also.
How old is your son now?
I love Halloween.
I love candy.
Where did you meet her?
Thats cool. Will you see her again?
I bet! It has to feel like a huge accomplishment.
I did not know you had a 4.0! How do your parents feel about that.
Nice. Did you take it?
Nice did you take it?
Good luck! Do your best. you sound well prepapred.
I hope you get it!
Im not actually in America so I dont share the same joy as you p
Thats always the positive side of hitting rock bottom right?
Thats terrible. Do you think theyll take care of it
Hope you dont end up in court.
I think thats the usual for kids. How old is she
Thats kind of funny though. How did she react?
You should never lie to them. What did you say?
Did your friend do something bad? Why were they looking for them
Nice. Which one?
That should be fun.
oh did you enjoy it? I love going to the beach
you miss your buddy huh
I do. Makes me angry.
I do not like Krystals.
Did he have a weapon?
What were you gonna do if you caught him?
Oh no! Were there a lot of lines you had to remember?
Oh wow thats impressive but I dont blame you for forgetting lines then since there were probably tons.
Wow! Have you looked to see how much it is worth? You could have some money.
You might want to talk to a financial adviser about it.
Did you find it?
Im sure everyone has lost something. Theyre just probably glad it wasnt them.
Thats awesome. Do you think you will get it?
Yes definitely. Do you plan on buying anything new?
What did you think about?
glad to hear you had such a carefree childhood. do you have siblings?
Thats terrible. Wh dont people just leave insteading of hurting their partner. I dont get it.
ME too. She wasnt the right one obviously. Sucks to have put in so much time though
I watched the first season.
What? Its ending? I heard he hasnt yet finished the books.
I agree. I love autumn.
I love Memphis.
It is a passing grade. I would be fine with it.
A guess an A wouldve been nice then since you worked so hard.
Thats good. Preperation is the first step in having a good presentation.
Fingers crossed I hope the presentation goes well.
Thats exciting! Cabin sounds really cozy.
Shes a lucky lady!
Thats the worst I know how that feels Im kind of being ghosted right now myself.
Just remember that means it was most likely for the best that she did ghost you you wouldnt want to be with someone like that anyways.
Awww. Do you ever go back and visit?
Where is rou hometown?
I bet you are excited... are you bringing anything over with you? 
Sounds yummy! Thats a good choice. Have a great time. 
What kind of rock would you want to be?
So a dwayne rock.
Did you get him a teacher?
I would be proud of him also.
You? I thought I was dreaming
Well no use crying over silled milk I say.
I feel your pain that happened to me a few years ago I ended up having to settle on a job I didnt like just to make ends meet.
I hope you find a job good luck!
Im doing pretty alright what about you?
Absolutely it is one of my biggest pet peeves especially when people accuse me of lying too.
I really wish I could NOT correlate to that.  But I can.  Me and my girlfriend are going through a weird time right now where she likes to tell me how hot other guys right to my face.  It is a terrible feeling and I know exactly what you are talking about.  If it occurs a lot more I suggest you saying something about it better to know the truth than dwell on it everytime.
Yea recently I have been trying to decide whether or not I want to mute my girlfriend on social media or not like not block her just mute her.  Because it bothers me how she acts single on social media and it confuses me as to whether she wants to be with me or is just trying to live a different personality online.  Because she talks to me and is all loveydovey then gets on social media and talks like I dont need anyone and talks about how hot guys are.  And it leaves me so stuck and with the worst anxiety.
Was your history test hard even after all the studying?
Thats good did you end up passing then?
Thats great. Where did you meet?
What did you eat?
Oh you were? I really am not a huge sports fan so what was so big about this?
Never once? Damn no wonder you were so shocked by it!
Yes when does the season start?
Thats exciting whos your favorite team?
Do you regret it now that you are?
Why are you worried still?
oh no. How long has she been gone.
I hope not. My friends cat left for two weeks once. she came back hungry but she was fine.
well I hope your cat returns safely.
Can you do any work to it. I know there are a lot ideas on pinterest to perk up a place.
Keep on the lookout and talk to realtors. They usually hear of good places first
How was it?
Thats great. Where did you go.
I worry about that too occasionally but I just push it to the back of my mind like usual.
Im sure it wont be most people die of old age around their friends and family in a peaceful way so just hope for that.
I am I like the Oilers whos your favorite team?
Nice I hope they do well this season.
Oh all kids are a little iffy I think. Are you a teacher or do you mean your own children?
Teenagers are awful! I am really looking forward to my daughter becoming a teenager....not.
My mom put the curse on me. She said she hopes my daughter acted 10 times worse than I did. If thats the case I need to start saving for boarding school because I was awful!
So is it working now? I need atransmission for an old volvo. Im saving for a new car instead.
Makes sense. I dont want any more bills until my kids are in school. Daycare is very expensive.
of course the 13 year old hates to babysit. I cant wait until she moves out. jk
This was the most fun chat Ive had today. Enjoy yur day!
What is HELLP? Im sorry you and your baby had to go through that.
Thats terrible. There are so many things to be afraid of when youre pregnant!
I absolutely hate car issues.  Will you be getting it fixed or buying another one?
Did it have any warranty when you bought it?
Why are you alone so much in the summer?
Do you have friends around? Go to a bar and meet some friends!
Was it as you remembered it?
That is amazing that it was not torn down or remodeled.  They seem to throw way too many buildings away these days.
I know that feeling too at least somewhat. Seems like clear favoritism to me but maybe Im wrong.
That type of stuff always makes me so angry since its so clearly favoritism and hypocrisy and they just dont care one bit.
I like football who are you talking about? what team?
Oh i see! are you excited with him? do you think they can go for the super bowl?
I know that feeling!  Are you involved in any political or activists groups?
Me neither.  But I agree with your sentiment  it is a great place to live and be a part of!
Yes. I do not have any kids myself.
Yes. Grandkids would be fun.
oh no. Did you get rid of the evidence?
whos cookies were they?
Do you study?
Thats good. Where do you go?
Interviews can be nerve wrecking.
I think if you stay calm youll do fine.
Yikes that must of been a bit scary. How did it go?
Thats something at least. I hope they catch him.
Yeah I have a friend who has gone through the same situation. She just wants whats best best for her kids. I hope things get better for you.
It shouldnt matter what you look like but why would you think you are fat?
It doesnt mean you are fat or overweight. Everyone is different.
I watch it sometimes It can be a little slow moving for my taste.
Are you from New York area. Im a little farther south but I do like them for sure. 
I hate jury duty.
Yes. They underpay.
Yes so are you having nice weatheror is it too dry and need some rain?
I see. Well maybe the weather is calling for some in the near future? I like sunshine but know we need some rain too hope you get some soon.
oh no! thats scary! The house didnt get flooded right?
im sorry to hear that!
Thats actually so frustrating! No note left on your car or anything from the other driver?
Sorry to hear I really hope that it doesnt cost to much to fix that up.
Oh no that really sucks. Thats awful that she wanted to end things especially since you were really into her. I am sorry.
Thats really odd and unfortunate. Thankfully there are many more girls that would match you better  Dont lose hope!
Thats sound nice. I went on vacation to Thailand last week. What did you do?
I know what that feels like. It must have been exciting! 
Acting as a mentor in these situations is always fun and it makes the whole experience better!
Oh no was it an important meal?
Thats so sad!  What did you end up doing instead?
What went wrong with the pizza you were trying to make?
Yes airplanes make me feel queasy too. What do you do to cope with it?
I am sorry to hear that. Flying is never easy especially when you feel that stressed
Who is she?
That is bad. Did you bought her a good present so she can forget about it?
That does sound scary! Were you okay?
Understandable it must have been very unexpected!
That can be a fun time it is nice to watch kids sometimes
I love playing video games I am sure he really enjoyed that even I would have!
Nice I am glad to hear about that 
How old is he?
Wow thats terrible. Why would he do that to you?
Im sorry youre having to go through that I hope youre able to sell the home for a better price.
Thats just terrible. Some people really are ungrateful.
Well hopefully hell learn to be a better person someday or eventually his actions will come back to haunt him.
I know that feel my brother graduated a year ago its a really big milestone.
Yes I agree it really signifies the start of their next chapter in life.
That must have been a burden lifted for sure!
Thats a shame since rain is really nice to watch and hear even disregarding the dryness over there.
Very true well hopefully you get some anyway! 
Thats usually a sign of a lack of confidence or self esteem  in ones self I believe. 
I hope you he changes some so you can still be friends. 
thats wonderful! ive never cheated on my husband either
it is  i dont know how is it possible to cheat on someone you love
I am sure you can it just takes dedication and effort is all!
Then you should have no problems at all!
that is so scary! you didnt get hurt right?
im so glad you didnt get hurt
I was also excited. In fact I have one right now!
Those are great titles. I am a big Nintendo fan. I cant wait for the new Metroid Prime.
That should be fun. Pokemon is a great franchise. I have many of the handheld games.
I have not I did hear that England lost recently though.
I heard they were doing great before the loss though hope you at least got to see them in some good matches.
Oh no sorry to hear that! Were you okay?
I can imagine. Well atleast you can look back and laugh it off as one of those days!
Did this make you excited?
What type of car was it?
I am sorry to hear that maybe things will work themselves out!
I feel bad I hope you find someone who treats you even better!
That sounds embarrassing what happened after?
That sounds like what I would have done too
What a Jerk. Did you let him know he was being rude?
hat a Jerk. Did you let him know he was being rude?
you should let him know now.
I loved my grandparents on my mothers side  so I understand how you feel. 
I was very close to mine. They are like parents but more fun.
That is scary what are you going to do about it?
Wow that is sad I hope you get that fixed
Thats fun my friend is getting married next year how big was the wedding?
Oh I see well thats still nice!
That is very sad did he ever get sober?
That is so great I hope you have found some healing and closure to the difficulties it caused when you were younger. 
Wow thats quite a move. Did he say why hes staying in Samoa so long?
I can understand that. Its hard to say goodbye to a friend I hope you can stay in contact with him.
Oh man thats a bad situation. Was this vase of any sentimental value or was it really expensive or what?
That might be a good idea even if just to clear you conscience of the guilt.
Wow that is terrible I hope he got to live a long life before that happened.
Thats terrible at least he wasnt a puppy I guess.
I can imagine you would be wouldnt want that to happen again.
Crazy they wont even eat vegetables but they will eat rat poison.
How did  he manage to do that?
I mean you said he barely passed it though. Must have been slim pickings when it came to giving out the sholarships.
What college did he end up going to?
Ah yes the lucrative writing career.
Did you get it done?
Oh nicely done thats impressive!
That is really awful. Did they take very much?
I bet that is a terrible feeling of betrayal. Friends should be more trustworthy. 
Oh no did it end up okay?
Im glad to hear it turned out okay.
Wow its a wounder you did not get killed!
Do you have any lasting damage? 
I was in a accident years ago and found glass coming out of my scalp for weeks. So I know how it is.
It would have been easier to room with your brother isntead of a random roomate I bet.
Strange they ask you to pay for college but offer few choices.
Thats great! That time with the kids will really be worth it ultimately.
Yeah its a good thing that you have a lot of time for other more important things now.
I did too honestly. I have really improved them myself good to hear that you have too.
Although I still deal with stress occasionally I know exactly what you mean. 
Why were you nervous about it? Usually drinking means to loosen up and have fun.
I can see that i had my first beer at 13 due to my brother but knew it was wrong at my age.
I totally understand. But I guess as a friend you also have to be happy for him and one day you will get your happiness too
Remember that the universe has a perfect timing for everything. Being with someone isnt everything be comfortable and enjoy your own company and love will come when you least expect it  
I bet so. Ive never done anything like that before.
That is surprising. Usually these things are a popularity contest.
I would not they have to learn at some point!
I get that but it was bound to happn at some point
You must have been thrilled! There is nothing like a first car. Did you love it?
No way  THATS the best. Paid for Im assuming and running. Do you hope to do the same for your kids when its time?
Damn I wish I had a car myself. What was the occasion?
Cool 16th birthday or what?
what did you do?
that was the right move!
Thats impressive sounds like a smart young man.
Sounds like it Good for you guys!
Ahh yes  must have been a very nice surprise! Did you play Mario on it?
Well thats one way to get your kids to do household chores!
What athletics did you participate in?
Man i know that feeling. But sounds like you worked hard.
When did he graduate? Sounds like a really cool moment to share with him.
I graduated that year too! Cool to see that you were as excited as he likely was.
I am very sorry to hear that that must be terrible....
I undertand that. People are crazy like that I never understood it
That is something I want to do when I get older I miss the golden days!
I bet it was to catch up after awhile few things really compare
Thats tragic I havent had to deal with anything like that yet.
I hope so too and I hope that you dont have to deal with anything like that anytime soon.
So your saying your faithful and love her.
Sounds like you got your priorities straight good man.
Wow go you! I am proud of you it can be tough to do!
That is what matters best of luck using it friend!
That is an amazing thing. Being cheated on is one of the worst things that can happen when ones enters a bond like a relationship.
I am sure that you two will have a happy and loving life together especially if she reciprocates your desire to never cheat. 
How exciting are you from France?
When did she move out there?
Great. How long did you stop working out?
It is always good to work out but start slowly since it has been a long time since your last work out.
Was the person one of those one people who goes like 5 miles an hour in a 65?
The question is did the woman at least do a good job  from what you could see?
How did you respond after rejection?
Yes you hear stories all of the time about people being rejected to find out that it was a blessing in disguise
I am sorry to hear that I hope things turn around for you soon!
I am glad to hear that I hope they work out for you!
HaHa What kind of food did they leave for you? Did you say anything to them?
LOL It really shouldnt be funny but for some reason you are making me laugh! I guess that will teach them to leave their lunch sitting around! haha
omg congratulations! Thats a great achievement and must give you so much pride and motication for the future
All the best for your future and your role aswell! 
You are right.Florida is a big state with lots of people.
The odds must be astronomical almost like winning the lottery.
I am shocked too Croatia only has 4 millio people
Yeaah they really were number 12 killed it with that goal 
I feel that man Parents like that care for their family a lot.
I am in that boat at times where i live.
I know that feeling good for you!
Yes those are awesome feelings I crave that all the time
well he did have a right to be angry depending on how you broke it ofc
oh darn thats just abit rude and unnecessary. I hope everything is ok now 
I am glad to hear that did you repay him?
That is good to hear I am glad it worked out well instead of a disaster
sibling fights worth living for.. I wish  i had one.
you would know better hehe!!
Well happy early birthday! I hope you have a great day!
I bet I hope you get everything you want!
Sorry to hear that. Do you have more firends now?
What is it about their style of play that youre not a fan of?
I see where youre coming from. 
Im not too familiar with Tennis Is he known to be a winner? 
Wow thats neat! Crazy to hear he lost then as you said.
What exciting news! Did you find out ahead of time what the gender of the baby was?
What is 2000 yen equal to in U.S. currency?
It sure sounds like it. I think healthcare in Japan is much more affordable that here in America do you agree?
Oh okay well I watched a documentary about healthcare in other countries. I understand that doesnt apply here.
Moms are good at doing that arent they?  What did she do for you?
I know that feeling! Whats been getting to you?
Im sorry to hear that.  I hope you make a speedy recovery!
yes especially if you travel a lot and for a long time. Is it for work?
Where do you go the most?
That is nice! I wish I can go to those countries
Wow ! that sounds really awesome. I wish I could have gone there. But surely not for work !
I wish you all the best pal ! You will surely rock !
Maybe something in your life  makes you very stress. You should try to relax before go to sleep.
You konw sometimes consulting  a psy is a good investment. Dont be afraid to do that.
That sounds very sad. I am very sorry to hear you experienced that. 
Huh I see. Well good for him!
Oh no. Thats awful! Did you report something that had occurred at your job? 
Yeah thats good. Its hard to know whether to blow the whistle sometimes. It could always come back for you. Im glad that it sounds like it worked out.
Yeah navigating those sorts of things is treacherous but as long as you know youre doing the right thing thats all you can do. 
That can be pretty hard to swallow do you stay in touch? Its easier these days with the likes of social media. How do you fill that void?
Thats such a shame we grieve any kind of loss I suppose. Perhaps the wedding would bring you closer together?
I hope it works out for you life is too short. Fill your life with wonderful things and wonderful things will surely happen.
Im not actually much of a soccer fan but the hype is hard to escape! 
Yes Im aware but im a much bigger hockey fan. 
I stand behind him. Compared to the rest of the world we are to easy on illegal immigrants and this is coming from a Mexican American. 
How so because I want everyone in this place to be safe? You need to google immigration in other parts of the world and you will realize how awesome it is here.
Its sad that you have such a small mind.
It does happen sometimes. Has it ever occurred to you?
You must have felt terribly guilty when you realized! Happens to all of us
Brain just wants to work against you?
I would get that a lot in school back in the day i feel its pretty normal to have those moments.
Oh man. Thats rough. Im sorry. Are friends helping?
Friends I know who have been through rough breakups often say that physical activity helps. That and time. But still  its difficult!
Holy smokes  thats unbelievable.  I gave up on playing those scratch off games
How often do you play?
Were you using it to get to a specific place?
I hope you were able to get it turned right back on in order to have directions to get where you were going.
I am hopeful as well but because we are human beings I doubt that will ever happen. There will always be the same old squabbles that have occurred since the dawn of man.
Yeah sadly our world leaders are too focused on flexing instead of working towards creating a world that is sustainable and liveable for our grandchildrens children
Thats sad. Sorry you had to go through that.
I would have peed in my pants if i was there.
How do you feel now after so long being there?
That is a great feeling i bet! Good job man!
That must have been terrible. Were you okay?
I can imagine it must have been very distressing. Glad that you were OK.
Yes many. Would you like to tell me about it?
Surely you were able to explain that this was out of your control.
That is terrible.  Were you able to do anything about it?
Did you speak to a counselor priest or family member about it?
That is terrible. Did you feel lonely?
How long did you stay alone?
That is pretty great! I am actually still a beginner with snowboarding.
I feel for me its just getting to the slopes more often too.
True ! Conventions give you an opportunity to learn as you never know what kind of situations will prop up
Do you have a professional degree in first aid?
Texas does that to us! It helps we live in a place where air conditioning is the norm. Or do you like spending time out in the heat?
I know what you mean. Its like you have to dress for both the outside and the inside. Thats great you have a pool in which to escape though! 
Oh no! Hopefully renters insurance covered it!
Well that is terrible for him but I am glad at least some of it is being taken care of!
Ugg I am sorry to hear that. Sometimes dealing with land lords is a tough business.
Were they fond memories?
Thats understandable. I hope everyone you know is doing well from back then!
Oh wow that sounds awful! was it graphic?
Im so sorry you had to go through that.
Sorry to hear about that. Did you ask him to move out of the house?
Did you know the person who was with him?
What song was it? Did you know it?
Man that is crazy! Especially that song!
I consider myself somewhat knowledgable about them too its very fulfilling being able to help other people with their problems sometimes.
Yeah sometimes it can be annoying though because they come to you with really easy problems to fix and you feel like they should know how to do it themselves.
Did you take that chance and redo it?
I hope the email will bring you good news
I know that pain!  Did he keep you up watching tv or video games?
Because mine does the same thing... If its not video games its the TV on full blast haha! Tell him you need your beauty sleep.
So have you gotten to open it yet??
Wow! I would have told her to fill out the paperwork herself getting your hopes up like that.
Oh no!  Well what he didnt know wont hurt him.  Hopefully you can get a replacement.
Awww well I am glad he was understanding about it.
Thats unfortunate. It is a difficult decision to make. Sometimes we are put in those situations and they take a toll on us.
I hope he is in a better place now. How did you have Blackjack for?
So you all had relatively all his life. Yes it was the right thing to do. Did you get another pet instead?
Wow! You must have a very trusting face! That was very nice of you to help her.
It definitely was! How old do you think her kids were?
I almost dont want to talk about it you know? Are you doing anything to try to move from a place of fear to one of preparation or opportunity?
Good for you. And I hope you have moments of joy while you prepare for that?
Did you play it?
That sounds so fun! Im glad you enjoyed it!
I imagine that made you feel empathetic to his plight.
Please tell me that you gave him some money to help him out.
Thats unfortunate. Do you like her?
I am sorry. Did you set up another day to hang out?
What did you and your friends do on that day?
That does sound fun! Was the food good?
Oh no did you report it to the police?
I have some hot chocolate that can help calm you down a bit.
No! THAT is painful! He must have felt awful! Did he have insurance to cover anything?
I am so sorry! But he does sound like a true friend if hes actively paying you back!
That is exciting when your team wins have you always been a hockey fan?
That is awesome! I am from Chicago so when the cubs won the world series I felt the same way. 
I bet! always good when new life is born.
Oh that must be a handful for your parents.
I am sorry to hear that.I hope she gets better.
That is horrible news.Your family should make sure she gets comfortable on her last moments.
Wow I did not know that!
Oh no. Were you upset as well?
Of course! Im human!  Beyond the disappointments I think its how we respond that defines us you know?
Probably even harder! Is there another fellowship you have your eye on?
Oh sending you all the best vibes! And congratulations ahead of time Doctor!
Oh really? How did that make you feel honestly?
I can imagine. The unknown can be very scary and make you worry.
Oh no!  Was it a first date?  Or had you been out with this person before?
Thats so sweet.  Do you laugh about the situation now together?
Thats really awesome what makes it so complex?
Well thats really great that you were able to prepare so much obviously you know what youre doing! Do you usually have to prep so much?
Aww! Thats so sweet! How long have you been married?
Thats very exciting! Congratulations on your raise!
Please tell me you caught him!! That is awful!!
You almost gave me a heart attack with that story!!
That was very nice of them. Was it for a special occasion?
Well now you know they do! That was very thoughtful of them.
Where did you see it? 
I bet what did it look like?
What made it so difficult?
Did you tell the teacher then we know atleast you had tried.
Wonderful! Your team I guess? Thats exciting!
Its great you give them the respect for that your team or not! When is the Final?
What is it about?
Sounds like you will likely do well.  Do you expect any problems with other people?
Thats so sweet and fortunate that she was able to do that for you. I wish I could do that.
Youre right and I do all of the time. What kind of car did you get?
I remember those cars! How long did it last you?
That is such a stressful thing to come home to!
I am so sorry you had to go through that!
Oh how nice! Did you get to visit with friends and family?
Ill bet. Its always nice to visit but it can be hard to say goodbye.
You still remember what you got for it?  It must have been memorable!  What was it?
Oh I know that feeling!  My family was the same way and I still remember coming home after my last day of 6th grade and seeing that same SNES box sitting on my bed.
Oh wow what time did you end up getting to bed?
I know the feeling too well! Hopefully you get a goods night rest tonight. 
You shouldnt think about death! Take each day as it comes
Thinking like that seems stressful
Life is like that.  It is not what you know but who you know.
No need to kiss butt.  Maintain your integrity and enjoy life on its terms.
What battle? What were you doing?
Is that a video game?
Thats never fun.  Did you have any notes to help you remember?
That wasnt very nice of them.  Its quite common to forget things.  Hopefully next time you remember!
Wow Im sure it will work. Ive very hopeful for you.
My wife and I have been together for 12 years tried years ago and nothing. Waited a while and then started trying again and we got it. Fate has a funny way of working out.
That is great. With who are you going?
That is great.
Wow. What do you think will happen?
Well make sure you listen to your Dr.s advice!
Congratulations!!! That can be both exciting and terrifying? Where are you on that spectrum? 
I am sending you all the best vibes. Is it in a field youve worked in before?
Happily a lot of employers seem to be willing to extrapolate that if you had talents in one industry theyd apply to another. You can always learn about different subjects you cant always learn how to bring that special spark that customer service needs. Best of luck!
Ive been in that boat. What do you think the issue was?
That stinks. Ive been interviewing also. I had two places call me back for three interviews and then no offer. So I feel ya. Just keep looking.
how did that go? 
Was it a long move? 
Why didnt you have any friends? 
What games did you play at the time?
Sorry to hear that what happened? 
Thats awful people need to be more careful
Did you tell him or did he find out?
Awe I am sorry. In those instances nobody wins. I hope you guys came out of it stronger than before
what was the team activity? 
Im happy it went well for you!
What is your health issue?
Sorry to hear that. I have same issues with my knees.
Oh no were you able to tell her you did it?
Ugh Im sure that was hard.  Im sorry you had to go through that.
I SO agree. I would not want to live like that. And its one thing if theyre only affecting themselves  but when its aimed at others  the worst.
Isnt that weird? I mean it takes energy to be that negative! Does your brother feel that too? Or just cantwont see it?
How is she feeling?
Thats terrific. Hopefully she continues to get better and better. 
How did that make you feel
Did you confront him
OH I am sorry to hear that. How?
Oh no! I hope you can fix it!
I remember those days what subject?
It sounds hard! What grade did you get?
I have the same feeling but for the last 90s and early 2000s. Being an adult is no fun.
Yes or rich. When I was a kid I wanted to grow up. Now that Im old I want to be a kid again.
Did you decline? I would not feel very comfortable until i got to know the family. 
I agree you made the right choice. And it gives you time to get to know the hosts before a future sleepover!
Oh well that isnt fair of your boss! Most people wouldnt work at all while are maternity leave he should be grateful!
Well sounds like your boss is stressed out too much and taking it out on you! Maybe he needs a long break!
Do you mean LeBron James? I was hoping hed come to Miami!
I wish he would have! The Heat can use his help! Haha!
That mustve been awesome.  Ive only been to one NFL game and it was wild!
I can imagine!  I remember finding out I got free tickets to Disney World one time I was ecstatic.
Wow I am so sorry. That had to be so scary.  Were the cops able to find any evidence?
man I was hoping they would be able to help in some way!  I hope they didnt take anything to personal!
How sweet! How old are they now?
This is true for me as well I have a 17 and 19 years old. I cant believe it and just turned 40 on the 5th.
Thats..intriguing. Is there any particular reason why youre scared of the ocean?
Really? Same..I was about 5 in the deep end by myself.  How old were you?
I do not like OkCupid.
I prefer Tinder.
I wish i was Chris Pratt but why do you wanna be The Pitt
This is very true But would you want to be bugged by people all the time.
I love Pokemon.
Cool. I liked Pokemon blue.
Why do you fail? Do you not study?
No one is smart until they learn to be smart. We are all born with brains but not smarts. We must gain smarts.
You can be the next trump if you work hard.
You have to work hard and get good at somehting.
Im sorry to hear that. You two were close?
I did the same with mine. I lived with her during the summers and went home when school started back.
Hey it happens sometimes. What was the situation?
Trust me Ive been there! Some days are better than others. Did you apologize?
I know that must have been so disappointing!
Well there will always be other chances for this match up to play out again.
Im sorry to hear that.  It must be difficult to be away from the one you love.
Im glad to hear that.  I wish you continued love and success with your marriage.  Its a rare gift to have these days.
Does he have good characteristics too or is he just annoying all the time?
Does he at least have interesting things to say when he talks?
Sorry to hear that.  Do you play soccer
Oh cool.  Maybe he was more of a hockey fan
How long have you been playing
Yeah when you break that fear from asking life gets A LOT better.
I am a male so it was hard at first to do that since most girls do want some assertive guys.
Im sure you had a good reason. What was it about?
Why would you lie about that? It couldnt have been that bad? 
I love family reunions.
What song was it?
Ive never heard of it is it from the 80s?
I have a Xbox 360.
I love Madden.
Cool. What makes you so confident
Nice. gotta love easy credit when you put in the work
He is cool. I would settle for a British butler. Is he your favorite super hero?
I really like Batman too Christian Bale is my favorite Batman. 
So exciting! Where are you going again?
Whoa! Thats incredible! Ive never even been out of the country. Who are you going with again?
I agree completely.
The movie or Information Technology?
I liked it a lot too Cant wait for the next part of it.
Me too! When do you start school?
August as well.  What are you studying?
What did he do?
Did you try to bribe him?
What did he buy you?
I have an iphone7.
Ive heard his net worth is like 20.9 billion dollars!!  I wish I was him too  LOL!
If I were to travel to Mars it would be with him!
I can totally relate. Dogs are better than most people. What kid of dog was it?
Im sorry. Dogs take a piece of our hearts when they go. 18 years is a very long life for a dog I bet you had a lot of great times together!
Wow you are strong.
What do you eat to be so strong?
Thats cool.  Im still a Boston boy...lived in Lowell MA in 45th grade
No I want to though.  Did you score tickets or something
Oh Im sorry to hear that. Did you stay in the capital?
Oh no! Next time make sure you go to Mexico City! Its a blast! Besides Cozumel isnt really that dangerous at all.
Thats great! Its important to have confidence in yourself and your abilities at work to be successful. Its a good example to set for your coworkers too!
Well thats the most important one to make sure is happy! Good for you!
I can relate  weve been in our house 18 years and have yet to do anything.  What style are you doing it in?
I bet you are having a blast!!!  How long do you think the renovations will take until you are done?
Oh thats terrible!! What is HELLP syndrome?
Thank goodness she was able to come but that must have been so scary! I hope youre okay now!
Ive been there when a new company bought us out. How did you handle it? 
That sounds stressful. At least they offered severance.
Emotions run high  we all say things we dont mean. What happened?
Honestly you got to pick one or the other. I can see how you were frustrated but Im glad you realize you shouldnt have yelled.
Why is that? Is there something wrong with you?
You should work on that.Be a better version of yourself.
I love Donald Trump.
No he lowered my taxes.
My husband has that issue.  Are you shorter than average?
Ive heard of people trying to hang upside down for hours a day to lengthen themselves.  Not that I think it works but apparently many people would like to be taller.
That isnt cool. Are you ok?
That is mean. Girls can be mean sometimes.
Thats understandable was it strong? 
Wow impressive. Was it your first? 
really?? I could not care less.
I am more like a rock and roll type of guy myself.
Where does she work?
Thats cool. I went to school for marketing.
What score did they get?
Yes. I wouldnt go back.
He does?! So exciting! What team does he play for?
They are doing really well this season! You must be so proud!
That must have been stressful. Did you report it?
Are they going to accept responsibility and buy you new items? 
Oh man that sucks...Id be really embarrassed
Sorry to here that.  Just curious are you male or female
I am a male.
I am Filipino also.
Oh Im so sorry to hear that! I know how hard that can be for the family as well. Is he able to get treatments?
Well I cant relate to some extent. My father passed away 2 years unexpectedly. It wasnt from cancer and we actually never thought he was going to pass away that day when he went to the hospital. But its very hard to lose loved ones!
yes I love new gadgets.Specially from the Apple store.
I remember also playing games with old and slow computers when i was a teenager.
Was it the summer flu? Heard that went around a lot.
That just sounds so bad. Glad she is better now!
Why? You should be happy with who you are.
Height you can not change but if you work hard anyone can be rich. 
Just work hard and make your own money. 
Im sure you will. Have you been training? 
Do you think thats enough?
Im so sorry. That must have been so painful for you. Were you close?
My heart hurts for you. Thats such a terrible loss.
Is it ok?
I do not like salesman.
I dont think there is anything wrong with average. 
We are all average until circumstances require us to be extraordinary. 
I saw that movie a long time ago.
What was your favorite part
Cool I guess she was strong.
Do you have any kids?
I do not how about you?
Thats cool what kind of camera do you have?
That is an awesome achievement! Was it for high school or college?
I never played any sports in high school I always had to work. That is a great accomplishment!
Yikes door guy cant catch a break. Is he ok?
Wow thank god hes on the up and up. I cant imagine how rough that must have been.
Man I feel you.  Today was her birthday..but I thought it would be awkward to go over since she blocked me on facebook
Where are you from originally.  Im Filipino
I have not and dont want to.
I do like a good sandwich thou. But I eat slow.
Awe I am sorry for your loss. Was it sudden?
I am sorry for the loss. Are you okay?
Was it pretty close?
Bummer.  Havent seen it.  Dont watch soccer but I respect the sport
Wow you are lucky you did not die.
Did someone save you?
Why? She seems to be nice person
Oh I didnt know about that. How she is able to steal money?
Hopefully it will work out.
Good for you.What is the reason of all this happiness?
You choose the best time.The summer is perfect for beaches.
Yes. They should of won.
Yes but the choked like usual.
I would be as well if I were you. Are you from the area?
wasnt Johnny Manziel susposed to save that team?
Im not a big fan of them either.  Are you able to go up in buildings with an elevator etc..?
Has it ever caused you to not be able to enjoy certain things in life?
Were the results good or bad?
Yes I am sure it was.
aww he must be adorable.
hahah how old is he?!
Oh that is exciting. How big is your house?
Oh that sounds nice. Whats your occupation?
Wow thats pretty bad parenting.
Is it for religious reasons
Hindsight and all that  do you miss her?
Perhaps she may forgive you?  Its always worth a try sometimes you just need some time and some growth before you can revisit mistakes that have happened.
What are your plans?
Wow that sounds like a fun and interesting time but it sounds like there are a high chance for things to go south and be a huge mess
Oh no! Im sorry to hear that. How deid it happen?
Are you going to sue? You could get a whole new leg!
How much would you like to lose?
Sounds like a plan! You can also try to see if there is less calorie version of foods you like.
I know how that can be such a struggle.  How long has it been and why did it end?
Everyone makes mistakes we live and learn I guess.  If there is no hope of her taking you back then you have to find a way to move forward but take the time you need to grieve as it is a loss.
Nice! Does he feel pretty confident about it
Awesome! Glad it worked out for him
Yes I have actually. It was scary.
Im so sorry to hear that. I was watching a house for a familty member and theyre safe was stolen.
I love the beach the gulf is my favorite!
The Atlantic is not so bad!
Sorry to hear that.  My grandmother is all I have left. Grandpa passed 1 month ago
How old are your daughters
Wow  were you nervous or scared at all?  Did the police get involved?
Oh no!  Did you have to go to the hospital to get stitches or anything like that?
That is fun! What was it?
What a neat mystery. I bet you wish you could thank them though. 
Oh no Im sorry about that do you have any family that can help?
Do you have any leads on any new jobs?
Oh no. Did you talk it out with them?
Thats nice. Everyone makes mistakes. Glad he was forgiving!
That was noble
I guess when you do that well in school you can afford to miss a day because of that every once and awhile
That is an awesome dad. Do you still have the truck?
A decade is great use of it. Do you miss it?
Oh that is SO hard. It sounds like she had a long and happy life. Im sure you miss her so much.
What kind of dog was she? 
Oh no! Is she okay?
Thats good to hear! How long ago was that?
So I take it you are a soccer fan?  It seems America is finally getting into the sport.  Do you play yourself?
I would imagine so!  Argentina seems like a lovely place to live.
Oh wao those a terrible news is there any way to keep the house?
Well you have to weight your financial situation vs your emotional situation and see if it worth to keep the house i guess you have so many memories there.
ALL of yall must have been so scared! Was she okay? Any stitches necessary?
The vomiting is scary  so good that yall got to the ER and could confirm that she was okay. Was she fearful of stairs after that?
Im glad you had someone to take care of it while you were away. Was you mother alright?
Oh no. Were you able to get things sorted out? We live far away from family and I know how hard it can be especially when there are health concerns. 
Ah congratulations! What a GREAT feeling. Are yall all still good friends?
You know what nothing to mourn really. Life has chapters you know? Its wonderful you have the memories you do.
I watched a movie based off a true story on that once. It was truely a sad story for the little girl and her parents.
It was a korean movie. Dont recall the name.
Thats pretty sympathetic of you...but arent you worried theyll start going through your trash
Do you own any cats or dogs
Wow Ill bet youre ready for a vacation. Are you going anywhere special?
That should be awesome. Do you know anyone in Canada?
It sounds beautiful and serene.
No I havent. But now I want to see.
What an amazing gift to be given!  That truly sounds like a blessing for you.
For sure!  Did you accept the gift?
Im glad you and your husband communicate enough to know that!
What do you say to your kids to deal with it?
Thats awesome congratulations for sure
I am sure you are both going to be happy
Wow. What a mature teacher.
Was the fire related to the incident or did she get in trouble for something else?
That is great! Have you been looking for a job for long?
I bet it is a good feeling and are looking forward to hearing from them. 
Sorry to hear about your other ones...What breed is the new one
Haha nice never a dull moment I bet
Was he okay with the happy meal?
Thats good to hear!
WOW that is super scary! are you ok?
Sometimes i keep a extra pir of underwear in my car for this occasion.
Me too I havent really found a good strategy to avoid the nervousness to be honest.
Yeah the more you think about it the more you let your expectations and imaginations put fear into you guess we have to avoid doing that somehow.
Oh man I accidentally eat cake all the time! It is too hard to resist. What did your mom do?
That is not too bad. What kind of cake was it?
Wow. The DMV is just dreadful to go to because of stuff like that.
Yea it would be! How faw is your DMV?
Wow that is awesome! Bet you were shocked and happy at the same time!
I bet! Especially with the cost of college these days!
Oh Im so sorry to hear that. Was he adopted?
Oh no. Poor guy. I hope hell be happy with the man.
Oh nice did you have fun? What lake?
What did you guys do there today? Go swimming or fishing?
The DMV really should be better by now. Did you get a chance to do anything during the wait?
Wow. Just one inconveniece after another. Its no wonder people dread having to deal with the DMV.
Awesome! It seems like you really worked hard what type of work do you do?
Oh yeah. I couldnt do that type of work. It is too stressful for me.
That is so hard to feel like youve been looked over. Have you been able to have conversations with leadership as to why that might be the case?
Does that make you curious to look elsewhere? It sounds like its maybe not the best place?
Oh no.  What happened?
Wow.  It had that much of an effect on you?  That it made you consider your own mortality?
Well its good to remember your mortality even if you have to ignore it to continue normal life.
i am so sorry for you.  I know what a crushing experience the passing of a beloved pet can be.  You must be very sad.
That is awful.  An unexpected illness cam really strike like a dagger in the heart.
What concert?  Did you like her enough to go on a 2nd date?
Well that sounds a bit scary!  What happened?
Did he pass away or not live close to you?
Im so sorry its hard when anyone close passes on but I think parents are one of the hardest.
Why did you decide to change their education?
that is an important steep you are taking in your life.
Thats a tough decision to make but children do need someone at that young an age.
How do you feel about that?
That is a tough situation. You dont want to mess up a great friendship and you also dont want to hurt her feelings either if you dont feel the same. 
Why are you jealous of Eric?
Im sorry to hear that I know what its like to have your love stolen from you.
If thats the case then you have a chance to find a better woman!
Maybe he has no respect for you.
Have you try talk to him about those issues.If he likes you he should work on the relationship.
Awesome! What type of promotion? Did you get a raise too?
Congrats for what store or company? Did you get a raise too?
Uhmmnnnthat could have been really emotional for you
I understand Ive been there toohope your getting through?
I understand that all too well
My oldest only has 3 years to go and I already have dogs! I guess Ill need more
Wow that really old but not too old for mummies considering.
Haha yea seems like it would be really cool to see in person.
What did your friend say?
Did you buy him more food?
Thats good. It sounds like a happy ending.
That must have been very frightening. Did you have somewhere safe that you went to
What are the chances of that?! How strange but lucky for you.
What is happening on Sunday?
Who are you pulling for? 
Its always good to see an underdog win!
What is happening in February?
Good for you.You are going to have the time of your life.
Im really sorry to hear that. When did she pass away?
Im sure with time the pain will pass. Try to stay positive!
Oh my! That is so scary. Thank goodness you are ok. Was it the Uber drivers fault?
Absolutely. Knock on wood Ive still never been in a car crash. Make sure you go to the doctor if you have any pain over the next couple of days.
Where do you live? I live in Missouri and the snows can be brutal. We had a couple days at 0F this year. I hate it
I heard about that on the news how it was rare to see that. I LOVE Georgia. My favorite place to visit is Savannah. I will gladly trade spots with you.
My day was pretty good. I got to work from home and pack for my trip this weekend.
I am going to Cali to see all of the national parks.
I plan to go to both of those parks plus Lake Tahoe and Las Vegas. I have never been to Vegas.
thats pretty cool.  what breed?
Well you picked a great one  Love labs.  My friends got a big one he just attacks me with love everytime I see him
That really sucks. I hate it when people spoil shows!
Sometimes you just got to binge on your own lol!
Oh no.. that sounds awful. What happened next?
That is ridiculous. No one should treat you like that when youre seeking medical help.
Oh that is scary that happened to us a couple months ago!
I suppose find the safest spot to bunker down its hard not to panic though
I completely understand. I stay home with my four kids and wouldnt have it any other way. 
Yeah I do them all here too they are never ending. 
Yes it is  
Interesting! Did you apprehend him?
I could imagine the experience. That was a wise thing you did!
I cant actually see what you put in the prompt but man thats crazy if it was a ferrari.
I love Ferraris they are so expensive though one day I hope to own one.
Me too how does Christmas in July work?
Maybe keep it simple and do different things each year. Last year we went on vacation.
Awesome! What are you studying?
Curves are always a good thing! I was always thankful for them.
Oh yeah? Whats so special about it?
Wow! That sounds like such a fun time
Never had children as in infertile or a bad person?
Thats terrible I hope they grow up fine would be horrid if they didnt.
Oh no are you ok?
I can imagine perhaps its a good way to get someone to fix the steps?
I am sorry to hear about that. What happened?
I hope you have been able to cope. Death is a very hard thing to overcome.
Oh no I hope your kid wasnt too upset. Maybe need to lock the dog in another room when food is out.
Well thats good they yall still had cake. Im sure you will laugh about this in the future.
Oh thats sounds fun! How much did it cost you? 
Thats great. Will you be camping in the mountains or a foresty place?
I bet that was really exciting!
Oh wow that does sound exciting! Are you still at this university?
That is terrifying! Let me guess they were on their phone?
I would have been mad too. People on their phones drive like drunk drivers. So dangerous.
I can imagine it was a great experience not sure if I will ever have kids.
Defintely and im happy you went through with it after what I would assume was a long decision.
Why did you make that choice?
Ive never heard of ballet school being so intensive. Is it something shes considering as a career?
Oh no your cat fell out of the window?  Is it ok?
I guess what they say is true  cats do have nine lives.
Did you think you did well?
Thats awesome! It can be nerve racking
He should be there for you.
The best thing you can do is get ride of him.
He is not for everyone
There have been a lot of those in politics.
Do you get to anxious about it?
You should look for a therapy that will help you with this issue.
What are you feeling happy about?
Thats great. Im sure you will enjoy being with them
Cheating on her? I am in a relationship and not married and I have the thought too
I understand that. I live by a college. All the insanely cute girls are always around at every shop restaraunt and bar.
Sorry to hear that.  How old is he  she
Yes though its something everyone goes through...especially if hes going to be a man..I used to be the nerdy fat Asian kid who got picked on til I sucker punched the bully as hard as I could...and never got picked on again
Wow that is quite lucky for you! I bet you made some good tips as well!
What let you on your career path to be a male stripper? Did you have a role model?
I can imagine because becoming a mother was the best time in my life!
Aww I feel like that with my kids! Theyre always going to be my babies
how on earth did it get stuck?
Poor thing did it need ot be helped?
That is so sweet! Did he end up crying when he saw the puppy?
I have a cat. Her name is Venus. I rescued her from outside after she was attacked by a dog.
Thank you! I am drawn to the stars and sky and for some reason it just seemed so fitting. What was the puppys name?
Thats an adorable name. Did your brother name him?
oh my! I graduate this year in a short few months. I worked really hard.
I sure did. Thanks I worked extremely hard!
Are you referring to the 2018 Games in Asia?
Oh so youre a soccer fan? I dont really watch sports.
Oh thats good you prepared but thats terrible timing!
Its good it ended up not being too bad storms can be very unpredictable 
Thats the worst!. Mine was up extra late tonight too.
I know. We just read a bedtime story where the mom paints a night scene on the childs blind to make her feel better.
I hear you! I was college roommates with my sister and now we live hours apart.
That is so awesome to hear. Thanks to cars and everything an hour is nothing nowadays. Especially when you can put portable DVD players in there for the kids!
Awe I bet you felt so proud and happy for them. 
I know they can be amazing when they are learning and exploring the world... however I still dont think having a different colored cup than the one they wanted warrants the response they tend to give.  I have a 2 year old and a 3 year old son
I agree. I am still trying to figure out why they fight so much over Blippi and Peppa pig! They are both horrible just pick one and get it over with.  I will be miserable through both lol
Did she jumped really high or something?
tTHAT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF FUN
Oh I am sorry to hear that. Are you doing okay?
I am worried about you. I hope that you will have someone to talk to. 
Aw I be so. How old is he?
Wow congratulations! That is such an accomplishment. He must be very bright
That is normal.We all get nervous on our fist day of work.
How are you doing on that job nowadays?
I think so too! I swear it was like 2012 yesterday.
Thats insane. I heard that the older you are the faster time goes by since the percentage of your life that a specific amount of time is gets shorter and shorter.
Right? I didnt think about that. I miss time passing by slowly and being so excited for everything.
I am sorry to hear that. Are you doing better now?
I like keeping busy too. It really helps me stay sane!
No way! What happened...was there a confrontation?
Oh ok. I take it he was cat calling? There are classier ways of appreciating art.
Haha. Well who can judge art right?
Thats pretty funny. Did your sister ever find out it was you who took it?
One time my cousins dog ruby almost bit me for trying to put away a bowl of food. So I understand how dogs can be with food at times haha.
What would you have done in that situation?
Just be glad that everyone in your class probably has no memory of it now.
Awe I am sorry to hear that. Do you think there will be any chance of a reconciliation?
I know it isnt my place to ask but why did they disown you?
In the end I hope she sees that you were able to make it work and if you can and do she should meet you half way. You are very welcome 
Yeah I always hate ending conversations as well 2 turns just isnt enough. I will now let you end the conversation lol
Serious? Dont you like pizza?
So bad from the vendor
Haha that is terrible! Unless he was hot...
Well in his defense its pretty hot out.
Oh really?! Is she not afraid of the dentist?
Oh thats great! Sometimes it is just difficult to takes kids to the dentist.
You and the rest of the world lol. Joking. Joking. Why are you furious?
Yes that was horrible what he did. I couldnt imagine what I would do if I had my child ripped from me
Of course hindsight is 2020. But going forward you can live in a way that minimizes regret.
Its really not for them to judge. Do what makes you happy.
I know the feelings I had up until my 20s. Then I just realized how much they had no right to judge me.
You should always be confident and take risks in life.
Yea it reminds me of a time I took a risk on an investment. It paid off!
I second that. Ive been to all the parks a bunch of times.
Yea my little siblings love taking pictures with them.
Work hard at itpoverty is no joke. Not an option!
And play smartdo whatever it takes to elevate yourself. That is the attitude.
Thats great! You must have good credit. 
Thats great make sure to keep your utilization low if possible.
In what way are you fearful? Ive never thought about that before.
I am 42 40 didnt bother me.....there is nothing you can do about the aging process. I just try to take getting older in stride.
Wow... That is exciting. Congratulations! I also won my fantasy football league this year and won 300 as well.
Im sorry to hear you lost your best friend.
I know the feeling. Seeing my friends kid read the books I used to read brings back great memories.
Riiight. It is just so cool to see the younger generations learn and see the things that once brought us joy at one point.
I still love going on planes. Makes the headaches of airports worth it.
I wish I could still sit in window seats. Im too tall now I can only sit on the aisle.
Why do you say it like that? Is everything okay?
Whoa. Im really sorry and I really hope thats not the case. 
I am so sorry to hear that. Is it related to your work?
I see. Well this is how democracy works and we will have to accept it
Keep calm.That is the very important step you should take.
You should breath deep and start focusing on the issue in hand.
Ah that sounds like a good time. Hope it doesnt rain for you guys.
Yea the radars are usually accurate. Cook good food for me.
I hope they are good cooks.
I always have the worst luck. 
Maybe. I think some people are just born with it.
What did you order?
Oh no! Hopefully you will get to wear them on your next trip to the beach.
That is my favorite thing to do. I am sure they are glad when you are home.
You definitely deserve it.
Oh my goodness I bet! I am sorry to hear that you went through that.
Well that is definitely good to hear. It must be so hard to go that long as somebodys side kick and lose them.
Thats great you are happy with where you are in life. I think the place we work and the area in which we live make a big difference.
Having a clear and defined path is important. Success comes from hardwork and dedication.
I love to eat there. One of my favorite foods to eat is steak.
Ive never tried that but it looks pretty good. One day I have to try that.
That seems bad and I am sorry to hear that. What happened?
I am truly sorry to hear that. Please accept my apologies for your loss. May he rest in peace
I am sorry to heard that.How long were you together.
I agree with you.I was lonely for a whole year.
Was it cold?
Ive worked in retail before. Id be afraid to get stuck in the freezer.
Why?  Is there something good going to happen on Sunday?
Oh yeah!  Allez les bleus!  But good on tiny Croatia for even making it that far.  Thats an incredible story for them.
Nice. Thats always a good feeling. 
I bet. I know the feeling well since my car is also on its way out. 
Its so good you stayed loyal I think anyone wouldve appreciated a friend like you.
Yeah because faithfulness is what defines a true friendship after all.
Awe I am sorry. What made it tough?
I hate when bosses are like that. Is he normally like that? If so I would sit him down and talk to him and tell him how his actions are affecting you
I agree with that. Victor mentality. 
Thats the spirit that got trump elected.
Oh no! How disappointing. Hopefully you didnt cut yourself!
Oh well at least that is a plus. 
I always wondered how you start something like that up with your partner without hurting their feelings.
Whatever makes you happy I guess. To each their own.
How terrible! I bet your heart stopped in that moment.
People seem to only care about themselves a lot.
I feel you.I also get sad when i see people living of the street.
There not a lot we can do.Maybe presure the local politicians 
Why? Is it something with your worklife balance?
You should take it easy. Just relax and cross your fingers for the best to come yet
Oh no. I am so sorry. That is so hard. My daughters cat got run over like a week after we had him.  What was your dogs name?
Doodles. Thats a cute name! Im sorry about your dog. 16 Years sounds like a good long life.
If it doesnt work out he can always go back.
I certainly dont. I was miserable as a kid.
Yes some worse than others. What do you miss the most?
You can always organize a reunion for your former classmates.
Ugh I hate the waiting game. Whats the job for? Have you tried calling back and checking in?
Teaching sounds good. We seriously need more amazing teachers. Ill pray that it will all work out for you. 
Were you able to finish right?
LOL.That was funny.The most important thing is that you build the toy.
Im sorry. Were you close?
I cant imagine what that was like. I hope you find peace.
Oh thats too bad. How long before they get home?
Oh well hopefully it goes quick for you but at least they will have a good trip which is nice!
I hope it goes okay and for you the time passes fast! 
Thats so sweet!  Modern technology is amazing right?!
Yes thats the bad part.  Was the call that way for her?
Ha ha  Im glad she didnt really notice it!
Its summer now for me.
Oh I see. I felt that way when I was waiting for school to end.
Really? The world cup right?
Of course. I played soccer growing up myself.
This has to be a very stressful time for you. How are you holding up?
I hope they she will view you as a valuable member of their organization and do what is necessary to make sure you are well compensated. 
Ahhh.  Math.  I have certainly been there before.  I am so sorry!  Is there any way to retake it?
Dont feel too bad.  I had to take college algebra 3 times before I finally passed with an A.  Sometimes you just need a good teacher.
Congratulations. You finally did it. What is your occupation now?
That is a very noble that you have taken. I wish you successful career with full of joy
That is great to hear. I can tell your family loves you a lot!
It is nice we have days to celebrate mothers and fathers. They deserve the recognition for their hard work!
Oh no! Did you end up talking to your neighbor about it??
Oh well thats a nice thing to do. Im sure she forgives you because she knows you felt bad and wanted to make it right.
Wow that is impressive. I probably couldnt have done it with a tutorial how. I would have walked around with a flashlight until someone felt sorry for me and fixed it
That still is impressive. I bet you did feel like you accomplished something
Wowhappy belated birthdaymake sure you have a blast.
Nicewas what were you up to?
Are you nervous about it? I know I was when I had my first interview.
The best thing to do is not worry and just remember what you want to say to the interviewer. You will do just fine!
Well You can be hopeful. But i think you should  stop gambling
If it is sure then you do not need luck
Oh wow. Im so sorry to hear that. Was this an all the sudden thing or has he been in poor health?
Its so hard how that usually is the case. Never deserved. Is his surgery scheduled soon?
Im really sorry. I cant imagine what youre going through. Ill be praying that he will get his lungs ASAP and that in the meantime youll feel at peace.
Thats so sad. I just had a cat disappear its quite sad.
We thought it mightve been hunted by coyotes since we live close to the woods. Pretty crazy.
Wow. They must have been very grateful to you. 
Getting the fulltime sounds better taking a one time bonus from him.
Oh my god fresh cookies that you hand baked?? What did you do?
HAHAHAHAHA  that what my niece does I bring home two candies and she talks me into giving her one then she hides the other when im not looking
come on now? you are so full of yourself!Why do you say so?
Sorry about that.
Thats so awesome. Isnt it so nice when people do nice things for each other in their communities?
My community is great about that kind of thing. Im glad you got your money back!
Oh thats great! Thats really nice of you. 
Wow that is exciting for sure. You must have been filled with anticipation.
I certainly hope he did propose and that you are still happily living.
Congratulations! Good luck with your future marriage.
Oh no! I hate the dentist too! I havent been in forever. Im sorry. You will be okay though! Hoping it all goes well. Is it hurting you?
That makes total sense! Good job for thinking ahead like that!
Sure my dad is a Cowboys fan. He misses the days of Troy Aikman and Emmett Smith!
Yeah I remember as a boy watching those guys. They creamed Buffalo in the Super Bowl!
Road rage is a problem I deal with too.  I have adult add and tend to be impulsive and am horrible at socializing.  Im glad your alright and I dont blame you for getting stressed out by that.
I cant believe she didnt at least apologize or wave sorry.  Thats why cell phones are horrible and can cause accidents.  Im glad your ok
Have you ever spoken to someone else about it? Its always a relief to talk things out.
She took care of you when you were little so it only makes sense that youd want to return the favor. Youre a good child.
Oh yeah? What happened that day?
Oh no! I hope everything turned out well at the end of it!
I eventually threw up. Anything you have to say though?
Oh well that sounds like it ended well at least. What was the fight about?
Yea I know how you feel you just feel like you are in purgatory waiting for your demise.
Yea but i mean afterwards you dont know if you passed the interview
i think you have the same attitude like me. i really feel pissed off
the best way is to tame it well so that it will have good manners
My same exact sentiments it can be lonely out here.
Get registered to some of these dating sites.
Thats awesome. What desert is it?
I dont like lemon deserts that much but that sounds amazing.
Yea I know how you feel I have no idea what im doing in math sometimes
Yea I just aim to pass and pray it can be hard sometimes depends on the teacher
I have had way too many close calls on my finals. How did you do?
Nice! Good to hear that things worked out for you in the end!
Well thats pretty annoying. He should have given it to you anyway. A is a great grade.
You probably also learned your brother is a cheapskate haha. I hope you did end up getting that car one day!
That is very unfortunate that you put all that work in and were let down. I hope something good came out of it like another good job afterwards.
That is not fair for employers to count education more than life experience.
Yes! Theres nothing like the relief that comes with not having any assignments or projects due
Ive never been on a cruise before Im too afraid of the open ocean. Where are you going to go cruising?
Oh thats too bad! Have you told him how you feel?
Thats frustrating! Maybe if you just keep putting your foot down he will eventually get the message. I hope he does soon!
Kids are really cute at that age.  Embrace the cuteness while you still can!
No I dont have any kids but I teach so I have other peoples kids to fill that space in my heart.
What? why would you do that.
You are so bold. I cant do it.
You like being surprised?
I like presents theyre surprising.
Oh I have only had surgery once I was really scared but it was okay I was knocked out so didnt know what was happening 
I watched so many youtube videos before mine its wierd when they give you the anesthesia 
That is really cool. Did you find a girl you really liked?
Well I hope you are able to find the perfect girl for you!
Good to hear! How did it pay off?
Wow thats quite the honor! Good work man!
What type of competition is it?  Im curious.
Wow how interesting!  I really hope you do well.  I am sure you will!
That is good. I am so happy for you. Where will your vacation hold 
I wish to be there too. That has always been my dream place for vacation 
Happy for you. Which course are you taking?
Wow! you nailed it. Sound like a tough course to study
Thats interesting. At least you got some new storage space!
Well stealing electronics can usually be harmful to the original user because information is so personally valuable so dont do it again!
Really? How did you win that?
Thats great. What do you write about?
That is really sweet I saw someone tweet about a baby laughing on the beach for 15 minutes today. Happy babies are fun 
Yes babies are so cute but I like being able to send them home with their parents 
Ive always wanted to go there! What did you like most about it?
I bet! Im guessing it must be good weather then?
Wow! That must have been hectic. Did you have a lot of stuff?
Thats crazy. The silver lining to moving for me is being able to get rid of all my junk.
Thats great to hear! I am sure you deserved it since you put so much effort in the project.
It is good your supervisor takes notice of your hard work. Nothing is more annoying than not getting recognition for effort.
That is amusing to hear. I hope your kids did not cry for their candies
It was wrong of course. I hope you kids would never find out that it was their parent who ate all of their candies
That sounds super fun I love florida and orlando its quite awesome.
Yea thats fair I could imagine if they are so near by you wouldnt care about them.
That happens to me all the time because I drive a large van with a lot of extras.  It is such a pain!
Maybe we both need to buy one of those chargers that you can keep in your car so you dont have to ask for a jump.
Oh damn thats not good. What happened?
What the heck thats so bizarre. Sorry to hear that it didnt work out.
What makes your new living facility nicer?
That is awesome. Having more space is always a plus.
i think that would be very unbelievable to run into someone out the country especially from school. Has that ever happened to you?
wow that is awesome where you good friends with them or you just saw them in the halls alot?
Wow thats amazing! How did yall initially meet?
High school sweethearts thats so special. Do you ever regret committing yourself to one person so soon?
Your outlook on love is really refreshing. I wish you two the best with your new futures.
That is a disgrace. Some people just do not get it!
That is understandable. When did this incident occur?
Free? How on earth do you get free cars?
He must have a rich family. I guess you dont?
Damn hopefully she gets it then. Why is she looking for a new one?
Man that does sound a lot worse. Well good luck to her then.
Oh wow im the same i hope she gets it its really stressful
yea its a really big deal if it goes through I hope you guys succeed.
Thats great. Does she practice a lot?
You must be very proud. I hope shes successful.
I bet you were thrilled. Theres nothing like a hearty sandwich to conquer ones hunger!
I tend to pile my sandwich as high as I can and still fit it in my mouth. I am like the Scooby Doo of sandwich doctors.
Thats unfortunate to hear. It seems like everyone lost that day.
I am sorry. Hopefully you can make it up to your friend.
what is your exam on?
o wow that sounds very tough but im sure you have it as long as you been reviewing the material
Ive been in the same predicament. My lease was coming up and I needed a deposit for a new apartment and my friend was able to help me out.
I agree. If more people were compassionate like that then maybe the world wouldnt be as messed up.
That is bad news and hard to deal with.
I sure hope you have a wonderful next Holiday trip very soon.
oh no! did you go out and examine what it is?
Its interesting! What did happen next?
Lol. Hope you had a good camping night!
That sounds like a mixed bag of emotions.
Exactly what I was thinking. Better cherish the time that you have with him until he goes off to college but know that hell always appreciate you.
Oh no! That stuff is no good did you have fun or was it more of a mistake? Haha. 
Oh yeah but we all make those mistakes as kids its good youve matured since then! Haha. 
Thats great. My mom had three boys so Ill be lucky to have a daughter.
It was more shared with the whole family. But later my dad hired a maid.
You must be really good with reading comprehension and remembering facts. Congratulations.
So youve retained all of that info and recalled it from memory during the test. I was never a good history student.
This is how you deal with such peopleput him off. Reprimand such bad behaviors.
You joined the groupdont complain next time lol
You are so right. Even some of the worst conditions in my home country are better than most.
I agree. We need to cherish the things we do have in this world.
It couldve been a ghost or maybe a robber?
Thats awesome that you have a mace. Are you king arthur by any chance?
Thats great exercise. Are you a fan of sports?
Deer can be pretty ridiculous. I am glad you are okay.
Thats crazy I couldnt imagine buying a car at 18. What kind of job did you have that you were able to do that?
Thats a pretty great setup so soon in live. Youre very fortunate.
Yeah for sure. Luck only gets you so far the rest is up to you. 
You definitley had something to be proud of. Not many 18 year olds can say they did that 
Why were you mortified? I dont know too much about net neutrality.
Oh yes I am sure you did great public speaking is a good skill too have. 
Why do you have to stress so much to get black Friday sales 
Okay. I think you need to find a better source of income so that you will not have to wait for black friday to get what you want 
Sorry to hear that. Have you talked with your coworker or boss about it?
Well maybe just ask for a meeting with your boss and go from there.
The news can be so sad. That is horrible that that occurred!
People need to step up and start helping others. I will pray too
Oh! Its excellence. Hope you enjoy your next year
yeah! youre right. Once youve moved there you started to love your city too!
Thats awesome i recently reconnected with my friend its really awesome when it happens
Yea it is one of the best feelings
hahah yea i have done that more than once.
what flavor was the cookie?
Was it someone you saw in public?
Hitting kids is kind of going out of style. People do timeout more now.
Absolutely i cant imagine being betrayed by a friend.
The best virtue in life.
Thats great. I just built my first computer actually.
Im not sure what a commodore is. I dont really program much either  but Im interested. I play a ton of pc games though.
Wow getting a promotion is always an awesome thing. You guys must be so happy! Will you guys be celebrating this success?
Fair enough that is very reasonable. Maybe you guys can celebrate on the weekend when you guys dont have work.
I hate when that happens.  I wish more people would be more cautious when they drive!
Yes.. it is best to be a defensive driver and keep yourself as safe as possible since there are so many crazy drivers out there!
That is greta. Is she really nice?
Ok so it is early days. When is the date?
Well let me know how it all goe!
That sounds crazy! What happened?
That sounds like it would give me a heart attack.
I am sure that was quite a delightful experience especially since you were not expecting to enjoy it. Was it regular tea or flavored? 
You had an invigorating tea delicious! Would you have it again or was this a one time encounter with tea?
No I dont know my neighbor that well but my best friend lives close so she has my spare key 
If you trust your neighbour it is fine
Nice like which ones to be specific?
I love delicious foods more so teri yaki so yummy.
Im glad you made it out alive. I wonder what drugs they were on. Some drugs actually make you more careful.
Good thing he wasnt drunk or he very well could have gotten in an accident. Alcohol really impairs motor skills.
Damn what would you rate both of them? I know it might be a little childish but it helps me picture it haha.
Wow he really dated up this time around lucky him I suppose.
Thats really tough. I can imagine how frustrated you are. Just know that going through trials and struggling is always good for your character and you will end up that much better of a person for getting through it. You cant be too concerned with others lives you just have to try not to compare. 
Oh well thats too bad but their behavior is not right or fair and they will deal with the consequences of that themselves. Forgiving them is good for you and for them. Just try your best to let go I know its tough but people everywhere are way more successful then you and way less successful and you dont compare yourself to them I hope so why focus on one random guy just because hes your brother.
That is good. You finally conquer it all with your patient. 
I will advice though in some cases you have to report this to the security agencies 
Sorry to hear that. Was it a difficult course?
That is good if you could pass it.
I know what you mean childhood friends are so important and treasured
I agree it feels great to have someone stick around for so long
Good for him! Sounds like hes a real slugger!
Did they end up winning the game?
Yum! I used to love Oreo Blizzards. There was a rusty hairpin in my burger from there when I was a kid. I almost swallowed it.
Dont you pick out your own clothes?
People care about the dumbest things.
wow that is awesome are you staying at a friends house? 
wow are you looking forward to seeing the coliseum ? 
sorry about that. what was happening
thats sad. glad you were around to help him
which exam are you taking?
Entrance to what?
Awwww.  That is so sweet.  It is nice to see when young people are actually being nice to each other!
OMG LOL.  Well maybe that wasnt so nice!  Ewwww.
That is outstanding news. You must be a great parent to raise a son who got through college.
Great that he finished early!
Interesting sounds like a metal band concert I went to where people were a bit goth. Did you go?
College was an odd time people the same age you didnt know that well.
Law seems difficult it seems..
You should  also have a sharp memory to remember what ever you have studied..
You seem to be an avid soccer fan. Is Croatia your favorite team?
Oh I get it that is pretty cool. I like a good underdog story. So this World cup should be very exciting!
That is really brave of you thanks for doing something about it
Yea and it can be bad for infections too scary stuff
Oh no were you okay?
Wow Im glad you were okay! Id be so scared too.
aaawwww thats very impressive of him. it must be a lucky day for you
wow. thats good. it is good you were patient too for him to pay back
Wow! that must have been the best surprise for a birthday. You are so loved.
You are so lucky to have her. 
Thats intense. I am sorry to hear that but stay positive!
I hope that it does not. Is it a bad part of town?
Like from harry potter?
Dumbledore is one of my favorite characters of a ll time
Wooi wish i was therecongrats
Yeai love surprisesespecially from loved ones
Well then avoid the stories that scare you.
Well theres no reason to waste your time reading scary stories.
Oh wow. so shes kind of famous it seems
thats amazing. My mother was also a beauty contest winner when she was 18.
Did your girlfriend cheat on you? 
But most people are still faithful in their relationship 
Now that is what happens when you are a cat lover.
You are so kind. Im never good with pets.
Congratulation for the baby. Is a good or bad suprise that our grandmother is coming?
I understand. It is always good to have someone that you can count on.
Oh thats frustrating have you told them how you felt?
Oh thats too bad I wonder if you could find a way to politely say something so you can focus.
Oh thats awesome. You feeling nervous about that? 
What if its opposite? 
You never know these days
Oh really what was the judges reaction to that
I am sorry. But i hope you have learnt your lesson this way
Really so what was your reaction then?
Wow thats terrifying you know
Awww you need to take a nap  for you to focus and read 
Are you always scared of the exam hall? 
How convenient that was! My daughter would love that!
I can understand that. Is it better for you this year?
ooh sorry about that why cant you join the
sorry to hear that. Why dont you try to make things work with your mothers relationnship
Yeah its true....  What happened?? 
I had similar situation with my friend last year
I surely feel your pain. What happened?
Thats not good. Sometimes its difficult to determine what is legit and what is not. 
Who is he to you?
Wow when did you first meet him
Nice. What scholarship?
Thats natural. Just dont tell him lol. Youll be alright buddy.
Sorry  what is correct
Yeah... So tell me more
Uh oh how did they react to that
Ouch! Thats too bad. I would have been cringing!
Wow you must be very brilliant
For them to really give you that that means you got sharp brain
Thats awesome! What type of foods did you mostly eat?
Those sound like much healthier choices. Congratulations! How long did it take to achieve your goal?
Hahahaha its really scary to read scary stories at night.. I had that experience 
Hahaha you thought it was a ghost right?? 
I wonder what was the work you were doing so passionately?
Thats interesting. You must be very talented
Reallyi missed that. tell me more!
I see you enjoy gambling.
Whats your report on?
Where subject are you studying?
Oh no. can you wash it?
That is worrying you might have to throw it out?
Where were they?
Im glad you found them.
Wow that cat must have loved that shoe he wanted it
That is true especially when you dont give them attention
Has he put in a lot of effort in studying and trying to improve?
Shows working hard is really important with ACT. How did you do in yours?
No way that sounds pretty extreme did you really?
Haha well thats cool did it last long?
Wow that is a big decision. Are you well prepared for the move?
Moving can be both adventurous and a big headache. You have to make big decisions about discarding many old possessions and selling your house if you have one.
Hahahaha what was she thinking? 
Its really annoying right
She may have done something else to earn that promotion if you know what I mean 
well perhaps you can brush up on some sabotage skills lol  get her out get yourself back in the game. Good luck!
good guys finish last. You have to be like Trump LOL aggressive
think of it this way Its not revenge its punishment
Im so sorry to hear that. At least you enjoyed your time with her in the moment?
Well hey. At least theres plenty more fish in the sea. Maybe the next one will be the one.
good to hear that what is interesting
thats great. i hope they do on my side too
Yeah they give up.
Wooow thats nice... You all will have fun together 
Yeah for sure...  So where are they coming from?? 
Thats good to hear! What sort of things has he changed or started doing?
How long did it take him to lose all that weight?
I tried it when I was a student. It wasnt my cup of tea. How did you find it?
Good. What did you think of Amsterdam? I have been there 3 or 4 times.
I am from the UK so I think its less of a culture shock for us. I remember seeing very high Americans wandering around as if tehy had over indulged.
It was pretty great but it was rough at times. You?
Thats great to hear! Mine was mostly happy but of course there was some issues.
Yeah I know how you feel. Not exactly the same situation though. I was going through with an adoption but same amount of responsibilities nonetheless. 
Well yes and no. Theres ups and downs but you get used to the responsibilities. Just expect more stress from your wife than anything else.  
Sorry to hear that. What was the dispute about?
I understand. It should have been not easy.
Wow did he forget your address?
Wow that is really nice
Lies are never a good thing in a relationship. Have you had a friend who was lying to you?
That is a good place to start I mean a relationship not built on truth is very shaky and is liable to fall apart very quickly.
this is so funny.i didnt hear it anywhere.
oh reallyits  sounds terrible.
Wow cool how did that happen?
Thats nice of her I love when teachers go out on a limb for students like that
Oh thats very resourceful of you. Did everything go as expected?
Nice! You sound like a great caretaker.
Im sorry I dont understand?
Its always good to expand your knowledge.
Oh really? Why is that? Seems like you were aware of it
Nice good for you my dude. Hard to get girls these days.
I hate when my cat used to do that. Would this happen often?
Cats can really be such strange pets sometimes I swear they live off of our momentary hatred for them
how are you
Ive not seen the movie
Hahaha I really love to see horror movies but I dont usually get scared
Very true. Who has helped you out recently?
How long have you known them?
k then what u do that time
k good here after becareful with them
Like bad dreams or what?
Oh that really sucks hopefully you get that dealt with.
A mother father and a brother. You?
Nice! Family is so important.
What engineering type did you graduate in?
Thats good to hear. You can always keep searching for that dream job while you work.
That it is cool. There was an old game that I loved Crash Bandicoot. Recently they did a remaster of this game.
Did you try Crash Bandicoot Kart? It is the one that I liked the most. I was playing this game several hours a day with friends.
That must be really annoying! What were they late to this time?
4 hours late! Totally unacceptable! But hey at least you live near a beach.
Greed consumes all. By the way who are you implying about?
Totally agree. They say one thing and do another just to keep in power.
Jealousy is the root of hatredtoo bad
Why will u be consumed?
Thats awesome. I never won but I got close!
Thats good man there will be more trust me.
Tell me about it. How long have you been job hunting for?
Did you travel anywhere for your vacation?
Awww are you always shy?? 
Woow we are directly opposite of each other
what does the pen symbolise
would you be using the pen for anything special
What field is that?
Thats awesome. What charity?
Wow thats great. Were you delighted?
I wish I could be as lucky as you. Well happy belated birthday.
Thats not good. Do you find yourself in that situation frequently?
I suppose that works. Sorry you feel that way.
Wow that must be very terrifying
That is so bad really not cool.
Thats not too bad. Computer science isnt easy by any standards.
Thats cool. Im studying biochem at the moment.
That is true but why the air nikes? Havent you heard about their effect on women?
Theyre known to cause erectile dysfunction? Theres chemicals in the laces dude! A conspiracy I tell you! Done by OBAMA!
Thats horrible. I mean if you have a job at least make the effort to get there on time.
Sorry to hear that. I guess your boss must have been feeling the same as you were about the nanny.
Oh boy that is a very delicate situation. Do you plan on telling her?
I understand your fear but it will be worse of you keep that big of a secret from her especially if she finds out some other way.
Thats good to hear its always great to have a good relationship with your parents!
Yeah unconditional love is something that is hard to come by.
Thats amazing! I wish I could lift that much.
Youll get there in no time. I believe in you.
Ah reminiscing can be nice sometimes though. What was the name of the song?
I remember Martin Mystery! I loved that show.
Of course I waking up early just for it.
Oh really? That sucks if they just asked people would usually be ok with it too.
Hopefully it isnt for anything horrid like drugs.
Wow that means you cant sleep with the light off
Wow fear is a bad experience
Babies are a treasure. Do you have any?
My wife is 6 months pregnant.
Does ghost really exist?
Waoi dont want to see them at all
Congrats my friend. How old is he now?
It only gets worst once hes in his teenage years and bringing girls home! But its worth it in the end.
What works in particular? 
I agree wholly quite an impeccable spectrum. I read online on 4chan that da Vinci was likely an alien from the future. 
I was always jealous because my brothers didnt need to work as hard after I moved away.
It was funny because I was out with one of the prettiest girls ever telling her I was jealous. I shouldnt have been though.
They have done well  do you think they are unknown though? The were semifinalists in 1998 and have had lots of good players over the years Prosinecki Suker Boksic Savicevic Boban
I always loved their strip when I was younger. It was the first time a team had played in checks.
I hope it is not too bad. You sent it to who?
What did you say to them?
That sucks. Where were you supposed to be travelling to?
Wow Jamaica would is one of the places I dream of visiting. I guess work comes first though.
Why have you have bad experiences?
Im sorry to hear that.
What made you good children?
What country were you brought up in?
Cool whose testimony?
Are they still going on about the election?
Have you tried therapy?
Yes I think so. I know people who have overcome phobias and fears that way.
Awesome where in Europe will you be visiting?
Im jealous. It will be amazing and I think youll have great fun there soaking up the culture and wine also I suppose.
Who stole them? 
Yesits really coming
Wepray and have faith
Well done you must be very proud of yourself.
Well done great job.
Yes me too  is that because of the gifts?
Yes it was so exiting! what about now do you receive many presents?
Great it hasnt got here yet.
Do you honestly believe there were less crimes back then? Or were they just better concealed
Thats cool.  I feel like that was true in your world.  But as far as I knew the world was a living hell for colored people more so then than now...but Im positive the news today only highlights what is convenient for corporate America
I understand. Do you like Tony Montana in the movie Scarface?
It is a very nice movie.
Why do they terrify you that much? 
Oh. Yeah some people dont get scared enough because they didnt turn lights off. 
Honestlythats very true
Thats the way he iscan u imagineso ungodly show
I agree its better to live in your own surroundings and have your own independence.
Im happy for you. You only have one life and should do what makes you happy.
who doesnt? missing anything can ruin the whole trip.
I think its better to have too much than not enough though. right?
Wow very interesting how did you see yourself then
I mean how did you see yourself when you were small
I hear you. Relationships are hard. What happened?
promises are very important. builds trust. Ultimatums should do the trick  
Woow are you really good in the court? 
Woow I guess I will like to play you someday
Ouch that really sucks. What kind of industry do you work in? 
Ah I can see why that would be stressfulupsetting. Well it is good to plan ahead but dont stress about it too much until you know for certain you are part of that 25 the odds are still in your favour.
That was rude. Maybe she didnt hear you?
Lol. Thats funny. Good story for when you become her boss.
Why does that have to change now?
Ah okay! Makes sense Im sure being a parent is no joke.
I always give. You never know if its Jesus in disguise to test your heart
is he still there maybe? hope so. Remember the movie Groundhog Day. It was the homeless guys last day
Sweet words like what?
oh. Meditating works. Unless you fall asleep and have a nightmare.
Thats lovelyi pray i will have one
Thats so good and funchildren are the best
Yeah? How big was the tip?
Thats cool. I never understood why places wont allow their workers to take tips... what business is it of the employer if you get money? Anyways what kind of place do you work?
Cox a poor man is automatically an Angry man
For sure...  I love working for my money
Yes we should be grateful to our parents for how they took care of us
Yes I think it is easier to remeber when you become a parent yourself.
Wow that is so exciting !
Good luck. Get enough sleep.
Hope you ace it.
Is that Tennis? 
Wow that mustve been a shock then.
Thats horrible how could they get it wrong?
They should pay you for the time you spend on sorting it out.
Yes I know they lose so much time instead of solving the important problems.
Yes and they seem so full of themselves while doing it.
I havent seen it 
Wooow that must really be interesting 
I have a few times my mom is really into cooking shows so I watched them a lot growing up and still catch a few now and then.
Yeah Gordon can be pretty supportive too and soft spoken which is surprising. 
Yeah and mostly near the end. When its the first few rounds I think he feels they havent earned any sort of sympathy or support since things are just starting out.
some friend. Maybe hes insecure and thought you or her were flirting?
well then he shouldnt have jumped to conclusions. Things arent always what they seem
oh no. sorry to hear that.
Pets are family. We still want them to be around no matter what.
Im sorry why not?
I completely understand Ive been in that predicament and it sucks.
Really bad...  Did you come last?? 
Awww you need to practice more often
I dont think you are alone there! What do you find so irritating about it?
I know what you mean. All the people seem to be the same types  fame hungry narcissists
Sorry to hear that what happened?
That was a hard watch. They were a strong young team and should have won but missed a few chances in the first half.
Shame on you .Did you at least pass? 
And you didnt get caught either?
Wow that sounds like fun
I completely understand
I absolutely feel the same way. It is a rare trait but there are few people who do better on tasks on their own than as group task. 
Yes that too. Or does not contribute as much like they should i.e. critical thinkingparticipatory contributions
OH. If he is guilty I hope he gets whats coming to him.
Well done. Did you study very hard for it or are you just very smart?
Well done good effort.
Oh no Im sorry why?
You should make sure to keep to your word to help then.
I guess children could have that tendency how fun
That is amaziing!
I still have two years left. I hope to have that feeling too.
Oh no sounds scary.  What happened next?
That goodness for that! There is nothing worse than hearing noises like that when you are alone walking.
haha. Ye like its normal to them. Nasty
hey eating dogs are normal to some! sick
Oh thats not good. Did he say anything? 
How come? Direction of life swaying you away from your family? 
oh no why?
That sucks. I couldnt be without my kids. Maybe you should go to counseling.
I bet you were. Who isnt?
I couldnt wait to not wake up early. Then I got a job lol
I consider myself a foodie now. Im skinny but I love food
Me too.  They really are a man or womans best friend.  Do you have dogs?
I have a little pug.  She is always so pleased to see me and loyal.  Are your dogs the same?
Its really devastating. But what really happened
Wow but its your personal life
Oh yeah? When was this?
Thats too bad. I actually own a ball python shes pretty cute.
is that good or bad?
OH wow. Thats awesome. I want to adopt too. Maybe foster.
Oh? What did he or she do? 
What are the payments for? 
Thats great congratulations
Omg im so sorry. I just realized my eyes focused on promotion results. I think there is a silver lining in every situation
What meal do you speak of? Breakfast? Lunch? Dinner? Midnight snack?
That is awful!!! What happened to the fly? Did you manage to shoo it away or end its poor miserable life?
Oh no that is not cool
I understand how you feel such thing have happened to me before
What happened there?
Are you doing okay? anything serioius?
that sounds like a lot of fun 
wow be safe
Sorry to hear about your loss. Sometimes its better for it to be sudden rather than wait 6 months for the cancer to destroy you
everything passes with time
so decide wisely how it is spent 
When are you going to find out your acceptance? 
Oh congratulations! Which college? 
Oh now why is that
Wow now you have a brother that is good to know
So how cute is he?
Hello my friend! I will gladly wish you all the luck in the world if you would only tell me what I am wishing it for!
Ah I see! Do you feel prepared for the examination? Did you spend a lot of time hitting the books?
Of  course I have its really hard 
Was it in the morning? Did you rush home immediately? How did you manage?
college changes you. Sometimes for the worse. Glad to hear about your brother
probably boosted his self confidence too
Yes I agree its a big concern. Do you live in an area of the world directly affected?
Thats really scary! Ill try to keep spreading the word for people to be more ecoconscious.
How did it go?
Thats good. It doesnt always work out that well.
you and me both
That is good do you like nice cars?
I am sorry about your car trouble good luck with that.
You must be really happy I bet you have a beautiful wife and lots of money in the bank 
That is what matters to have a supportive and lovely wife
I understand. I have been lonely most of my life. But it gives it back and it makes up the loneliness part. 
I have a solution for that but I wouldnt advocate you doing it. 
I can only imagine the destruction and how horrible it is to deal with that!
I am very sorry to hear that. I hope for your sake that things are getting back to normal and the destruction is being taken care of.
thats great I feel there is someone out there for everyone
I hear you there  I have also but now I am in the best relationship ever!!!
Oh really? Why is that? Because you dont have to deal with their antics while theyre knocked out?
I can imagine. Fortunately I dont have any kids yet so I do not know the pain of dealing with a bunch of crazy kids! Although it must be very rewarding.
It is one the worst pains. You would think wed keep our toes more protected
Stepping on legos are just as bad. and they are my kids favorite toys!
That sounds so frightening! Was your husband helpful?
I agree! I would have been screaming too! And I would have been annoyed at my husband for laughing!
Im so sorry how sad.  Do you wish you had been with her to say goodbye.
Of course I can understand it but at least she probably didnt suffer and is now in heaven.
That is always nice. Were they excited to see you?
That is awesome. Life can be random like that sometimes.
Never. I dont remember a time when it was that cheap anywhere in the world
Good memory. We all have to change with the times.
I dont even take beer
Nooo  the first time I took it  I misbehaved
Wow you sound really prepared for something.
Oh no is the end coming?
I can imagine and how did things go?
Great it is true that new places and situations can be exciting but scary at the same time
Oh wow that has to be a bucket list item for sure.
That would have been fun maybe next year
Wow why did you involve your self in spilling a bowl of cereal?
Thats very serious. What are you going to do about the bowl now?
Cool.  guess now you can be president.
I want to Secretary of Treasury. Is that still a thing?
Network do disappoint
Omg. I know exactly how you feel. I had a lump on my back but got it removed. Turned out to be just fatty tissue. Size of a tennis ball !
Good deal. I think it was stress related.
Wow thats nice  he must be very intelligent 
Awww thats nice  just take care of them 
Happy Friday indeed! yes I cant wait to finish work for today even when i am just beginning.
Yeah I have to.  And do you have plans for the weekend?
Oh wow. Did your friend do something to upset you or something like that? Or were you just wanting some alone time?
Well everyone has their pace. Maybe the next time you go you can invite her but take more time. Its fun either way!
Really? What sort of cooking do you like to do?
I love spaghetti myself! Im not a good cook at all though. Im always eating out.
Yeah thats very true. But it is much easier than learning to cook myself.
Cool. Most people dont like training.
I bet he appreciates you being nice though.
That was nice of her. I like pulling surprises on people too.
Hope you had a good birthday.
I live in an apartment so I take mine out to the dumpster every few weeks. I feel your pain though. Growing up I had to take ours down our steep driveway every week.
It is daunting. I think I still have nightmares about it. I feel dirty just thinking about it right now.
Must have been a good result.  Was it for a job school or for medical results?
I am sure your family was proud of you as well!
I am so sorry to hear that it must have been heartbreaking. How did your family cope?
Well thats good to hear. Possessions can be replaced but your family is all that really matters in the end!
I bet that is an experience you are still trying to get used to
I see a lot of cars that do not watch out for motorcycles be careful out there
Thats awesome. I wish everyone could go to college if they wanted
yeah. if only
Money issues are always hard.
Well you should look into that
Oh no! I hope you are ok.
Things happen we cant do anything about it I hope this accidently wont affect you in the long term
Everything was in the end but at first not so much.
Yeah it was a nice learning experience.
It must have been embarrassing. Hope it ended well for you.
Im happy for you.
Oh no!  Did they react by laughing helping or ignoring?
I can see where that would be embarrassing.  I hope your pride wasnt hurt too much... or you physically!
News that big would be a shock to anyone! How did you both handle it?
Im glad you both found the courage to face it head on. Nice job!
Most definitely!. Dogs are important members of a family.
Indeed. My son called our dog his cousin for a little while...weird I know.
Oh that is frustrating! I love Chinese food. What did you order?
Crab rangoon is one of my favorites. I would be bummed too. I think I know what I am having for dinner tonight.
Yes! They are super fun. Have you? 
I always am as well because I am not an artist by any means. 
Oh no! Is everything okay now?
I know thats tough. Its scary when your kids go through something like that. It never leaves you when its time to do it all over again.
Thats good news! What did they do to surprise you? 
Amazing Im happy for you.  
Why were you struggling?
I understand. It is impossible to live with only one income for family. I am happy she have an interview.
Being in debt is so stressful and Im sure that just adds to it. 
I dont blame you. I have been in that position with a credit card I forgot to pay when we moved and they didnt have the correct forwarding address. Stress on top of stress. 
I would have loved to study criminal justice
I hear you. I love true crime so I think that would be such a fun thing to study
Oh no what a sad and scary situation. How are they now?
I cant imagine how hard that must have been. Im glad he is doing better!
People drive more and more badly. Did you take the plate number?
I understand. I am happy that nothing bad happened to you.
Oh no thats unfortunate did you make fun of him or something?
Oh well sometimes we say things we dont mean. If you apologize hell probably accept it and be fine again.
Ohh thats great news Congratulate him on my behalf.
No one dies along I am sure there might be a person  in this world that is made for you  this is just not the right time to meet that guy. Just wait and it will come in front you when you really need it.
Yup! enjoy the life at its fullest without worring
It sounds good just reading those words what kind was it?
Well pizza for breakfast every once and a while wont kill you it sounds delicious.
Wow! Was it a scratcher or did you have to pick numbers?
Wow. Lucky you. You should try it again.
Cool! Where are you going?
Wow! Have you been there before? They have an amazing culture
Wait. What happened?
Thats good no? Dont you win then?
OH no. I didnt have that problem in MExico
It was two years ago. I cant remember where. We stayed on the beach all day.
Nice I dont know this sport. What are the rules?
I am happy that she is trying something. Sport is important for kids.
I have always wanted to work abroad. What work are you doing there?
Cool. And congrats on your future engagement!
I can see why you feel that way. Sometimes addicts arent in full control of their decisions though.
I think you have a right to be mad over that. 
wow! i would have felt some type of way to. what did you do after 
yea or be there next time she makes dinner and give her tips eating raw chicken is very bad
Have you tried making any?
maybe try going out to concerts or clubs or sporting events somewhere you can find people with common interests
Oh no. Is there a lot of parking available?
I agree. I had an apartment with limited parking and people that didnt live there always parked there anyway.
None that I know of!  I feel you.. if I ever had a daughter Id be overprotective and stressing
Nope lock her in the basement
Where can you get that kind of weather.
You had me at cheap liquor
Thats cool.  Its good to have loyal friends
What are some personality traits you both have in common
Thats important. Theres always tomorrow though.
I wish. I bought a spin bike in January and have used it once. I have to quit smoking.
This happens many times they just dont care of us
our siblings leaving us all alone in a party or a club.
What was the song?
Is it short skirt long jacket. I love that song.
Oh no thats so gross! Do you know what
My landlord has the same issue. 
Yes same for me just have to fix up the credit score a bit more ha.
Wow that sounds pretty stressful
Did he  she turn out fine without complications?
Wow is that really something that happens?
I dont think I believe you. 
Well is that something you can do?
Right well is there any other way?
Look carefully before you sign.
Thats cool. Was it not like that before?
My family is like that too. 
He didnt bring you anything?
Thats strange. I always try to buy gifts for my family when I go on a trip.
Ewww. I havent done that in a while. Thankfully.
They sure do. Isnt it the law?
Oh thats the worst I try to remember to charge but its hard to remember every time.
So hes the culprit! He better start charging it or else its revoked !
What were you guys looking to buy?
Ive done that more than once Im terrible at names
That is interesting what things do you do while living in America to keep your heritage alive?
I would imagine that might be difficult perhaps there are some online social groups you could join as well?
Just be careful not to burn it.
No sauce at all? Surely you didnt mean that too?
Oh no. Sorry to hear that. IS it different now?
Be patient and things will fall into place. Youll be fine.
OH no. Were they okay?
Be careful. It could have been worse.
Well that must be exciting to have so much variety how old are they?
You sound like a great parent theyre lucky to have you!
Mustve been a pretty vivid dream
Did you grow up with dogs
Family is important.
I have three. They are my world. I wish we lived in the country and not the city.
oh no that must have been terrible.
how long ago was it were you hurt?
well we all do. I hope you achieve what you set out to do
oh well what are you looking forward too?
It was a fire warning?
Wow what is it a big one?
That has to be disappointing. Can you change your plans?
Now you have something to look forward to.
I think thats the way to go when it comes to a wedding. Use the money for your future as a couple not for one day. But to each their own so you were impressed?
My suggestion is to go for your favorite food rather than some fancy catered food that you dont even enjoy!
Oh no thats terrible. Can you walk maybe with some support at least?
I see thats too bad but maybe there will be more marathons you can participate in in the future. 
Did you get any damage?
It couldve been much worse. Thats good.
Oh no! I would have been so disgusted! And mad!
That sounds awful. I hope you filed a complaint with the restaurant!  
awww when are you planning to visit them?
i really hope you will be able to visit them then! I know how you feel I didnt see my parents for a couple of years
Nice there is not a lot of people like you
Did it do much damage to it?
Man that really stinks. Any chance it was caught on video?
Oh no why were you fighting?
Im glad you guys could just shrug it off. But I imagine you guys were pretty mad during to break out into a fist fight.
wow nostalgic. Wish you had time machine..
best phase of our life.
Do you know where youre going yet?
Well thats a nice plan. I hope you enjoy yourself.
Oh no. Thats a nightmare.
She will be fine. 
Oh wow is she nervous about it?
How far away has she gone?
Any chance you could move too?
OH no. Is everything okay now?
Well at least he changed. That doesnt always happen.
I hate that. It makes it really hard to want to go home.
That would be good for you. Maybe you will get some good neighbors then.
You werent thinking about the surgery at all?
That would freak me out too.
That is bad. I hope you found a solution with him.
You can sue him
What song  instrument was being played
Nice I love Metallica.  Was he using a loop station and a backing track or what
Wow thats pretty good you must be a member of the thousand pound club?
Yeah I used to be a powerlifter but injures cut my career short unfortunately stay healthy!
Yes I watch the show. That is a bit scary though but not that much.
Ohh come on its not that scary you should watch whole season.
Haha Ok as you wish then
Nice did you become sort of a nature girl after that experience? Or were you just traumatized haha
Thats pretty cool.  So Im guessing youre more of a city gal
Thats sad maybe you were meant to be with your ex though. 
I know but I think were meant to stay with our first loves honestly but maybe thats too idealistic.
Was it a nice one?
Do you have kids?
Its never to late to start new. You guys will be fine.
Is it too hot to cook or do you just hate cooking?
Dont feel bad I have those days too. I keep boiled eggs handy for those times eating out gets too excessive. protein
Thats a good strategy.
I didnt I was a cheerleader though if you want to count that.
Well at least you can find an excuse to step outside the house and mix it up!
I love Call of Duty.  Whats your rank
What was the announcement?
Wow congratulations! I bet you worked hard for that!
I wish youll also move soon. anyway Im happy for your neighbor. 
Everyone has their time yours will come soon
What kind of laptop is it?
That sounds nice. I like having a touch screen on my work computer a lot.
what are you goals that you are planning?
money is the goal that everyone dreams of
Thats great how many people?
Thats nice I plan on having 10 kids.
I was caught stealing once when I was younger. It was so embarassing never did it again.
We learn from our mistakes.
I didnt go until I was thirty and it wa still fun!
It is a great experience. Expensive though
What kind of pizza? Now youre making me hungry!
Oh man I bet that is gonna hit the spot!
Cool. I still get excited when my kids say new words.
3 and 4. The amaze me almost everyday
Oh I know what you mean! It is even worse when you ask for their manager and the manager gives you a major tude!
Right? They can go get a job as a garbage collector if they want to act that way!
What game was it? Did you give him tips?
Was he upset with you for it?
Oh snap! That is not a good thing to hear about.
Well probably should confront him and if hes lying get rid of him.
Ive always wanted a surpirse party!! Were you happy that they surprised you in this way?
I always find it amazing that people never see it coming.
How exciting for you. Were you surprised?
Sounds like it will be a lot of hard work to attend such a school but well worth it in the end.
I know! Im going school shopping tomorrow. Its tax free weekend!
No kidding. Plus Im buying for two so double the cost this year.
What about it brings back memories?
That is always fun. Lots of good memories there.
Ha many times. I once blamed my dog for breaking a friends TV but it was me
Was it a good reason? I cant say Ive ever done that before
Oh man! That must of hurt even if it didnt break.
Its crazy how glass is hard to notice when its like perfectly clean.
Did you do something really fun?
I know what you mean. Sometimes in can all the difference in the world to be able to just relax for a while.
How did you manage that? 
Oh that makes sense. I hope you found out quickly before anyone else could see. 
That is great! Has he overcome an illness or heart issue? That can be serious and very scary!
Oh wow that is great is he feeling better since showing improvement?
What happened? did you get the best surprise of your life?
So how many people were in attendance? and what special gift did you receive?
Those kind of exams are really important. Did you study before the accident?
Man that is just awful though that happened to you. What was the out come of the exam?
Wow thats scary. Did they have a gun?
Oh the ole snatch and grab. Still must not have been a good feeling.
Oh that doesnt sound good! What all happened?
What was the case about?
have they contacted the lender for a loan modification?
I wish there was something I could do to help
Yes I grew up with 4 brothers and they always did it to me ..haha
Did he return it?
Oh that is not good! I am sorry for your loss.
That is a interesting way of being positive i guess.
I can imagine! Why did someone give you flowers? 
That is so sweet. I hope you receive more flowers in the future from your loved ones. 
These children hold a very special place in your heart. Its amazing that when this happens you never knew that you could love someone so much.
She will always remember the special bond that you have.
Well that is good! What class is it for?
Well hopefully you do well on it.
ive had hundreds. I know my toilet well
Man thats gross! I would have freaked out.
How did you prepare?
Oh okay Im unfimiliar with snow storms because I live in Florida but I would guess it is much like preparing for a hurricane maybe
I hope you didnt get hurt. Did people laugh at you?
Was it caught on video?
I sure do. I moved into a dump lol.
Yeah it was nice. It was a dump but it was my dump.
That must have been a wonderful feeling! It must have been hard not having your friend around for awhile.
She must have traveled very far. I am glad you two have reunited!
Whats the news? Do you have an interview?
I hope youre well prepared!
if they have kids Im sure they understand. Sometimes you just cant have nice things.
Yeah thats too bad. But I can understand her side too. Sometimes things cant be replaced.
Oh no what happened to your wipers?
I bet that was scary!
Oh no. Its hard to get mad at them when there really isnt anything you can do about it now.
Maybe a car dealership could help.
Did you have a team that you were rooting for?
Thats the great thing about sports anything can happen.
I love going to concerts. Who did you go see and where was the venue?
Im a huge fan of casinos! My favorite game is blackjack. Whats yours?
That is great. Some of the best romantic experiences are at school dances.
Sounds like you had a wonderful night. I am sure she felt the same way.
Awwww well thats too bad. Hopefully the owner is as loving towards it as you would have been. What kind of dog was it?
Sounds like a fun dog to have! Maybe you can check out some more shelters and find a similar one?
Sorry about that. Did you talk to your manager to understand why you did got selected?
I hope you get it next year. Good luck.
I recently got back from a trip abroad as well! Traveling is a blast. Where are you going?
Dang now that sounds like a swell adventure. Which one are you most excited to visit?
Dogs are so much fun. It is amazing how smart they are.
Little dogs are so much fun. I have a big dog and a little one.
I like a lot this show. I am fan but I never read the book.
Im sorry. Did they get them all?
Is it to late to plant more?
i was 22. Registering for college classes and I was freaking out so bad they just told me to come back the next day. I didnt go back
Really? I tried to use hulu once but it wasnt for me. You going to watch it tonight? 
I dont like scary either im a baby i guess 
Thats good! Its always nice to have friends you can rely on
I wish I had that kind of relationship. I left most of that when I moved 
Oh no. I
Thats great. I wonder how many hikers actually keep a first aid kit?
Thats wonderful.  Are you pregnant?
Wow how much longer?
oh its good. Take your all belongings without fail. Hope youll have good journey. 
sure. Have a good trip.
I hate shots for babies. Why do they have to get so many?!?!?!
You can tell they are mad at you too for letting it happen. I hate ir
yum sounds good whats your fav toppings? 
o uhhh oh you had to pick them off 
Cool. I hope you get it. Is it a lot more pay?
Ive never gotten a promotion at any job. But Ive never wanted more responsibility 
Awesome. Are you going to s chool or your children? 
Right i work from home so i feel you 
Did he come through?
Thats great I have a couple of friends like that
That would certainly make me upset too was it your neighbors?
Very annoying I would consider getting the police to pay a visit even.
She probably understood.
If she is a really good friend then she did. Dont worry about it.
Sorry to hear that. Is there any chance you two can patch up again?
Oh then try to keep busy yourself so you dont feel alone.
That is a shame.  I hear that is happening a lot in schools today.
They dont have time for all that.  They are trying to teach.
Did something go wrong with the interview?
Competition is tough these days. For whatever reason that job wasnt meant to be and youll find your perfect fit soon.
Thats really annoying. Did you send it back to the kitchen?
I think youll probably be fine but that dosent mean your lunch isnt ruined.
Are you going to reorder from some where else?
You could always just go the sushi route from now on.  You cant udner cook it.
Thats great. Some people arent so lucky. They die at a job they hate
Thats awesome. I hope you love it
Were you able to get it off of your shoe?
Keep working at it youll get it all. Try ice on it to harden the gum first.
Its really hot where I live.  Im ready for it to be over.  Its 100f out side right now and very humit.
I guess its different if you live where it gets cold during the winter.
You continues a series on Netflix I hope and not the other thing
You shouldnt have. What happened?
Thats nice.  Shes becoming a teenager full force!
I am sure she will be fine.  We all made it through.
Why were you nervous?
Oh I see. How did it go?
I bet you were.
That just means more food for you. That sounds like a win to me.
Tell them the next time they need to get up if they want good food too.
That has been happening a lot lately.  Everyone in the US seems to be getting wet.
Im so sorry you got rained out.  Do you at least get a refund?
Whoa thats scary! Did you freak out?
I can imagine. Did it look like a stereotypical ghost like Casper?
Oh no Im so sorry to hear that were you close?
Oh thats so sweet I wish I kept in touch with my family too
Cool. Was it an all nighter?
Thats my kind of party.
thats really good! Have you been driving distracted when you uber?
oh okay sorry i was just a little distracted about my car accident the other day.
this semi pushed us off the road Im still a little freaked out about it
Well thats nothing compared to what could have happened.
Who else was in the car
Im sorry to hear that. Thats awful.   How long were you together?
You must not have been speeding too much!
Were you nervous being pulled over? Ive never been pulled over myself.
Thats great how did the interview end up going?
Thats always great better be be over prepared. So did you get the job offer?
Oh no! They are terrifying little dogs arent they?
Theyre really loud too actually they bark a whole lot more than other dogs
Oh I totally hear you there. You cant just like be yourself and not that being yourself is bad or anything
Yeah me either. Once people get to know me its fine but usually people dont like me when they first meet me. idk!
You still consider them your friends after that?
Thats messed up.
Wow thats absurd.. Of course its the ONE thats impotrant.
Thats always so awful.. Its too bad it wasnt something you bought with a credit card and could just dispute it..
I can see why youd be happy about it I mean you doubled up even with it being a small amount! Where did you buy it?
Wow I mean everything happens for a reason.. Thats great!
oh gosh thats horrible. i cant imagine how you feel. i would be so heartbroken
you dont deserve it! nobody deserves it
it happens. i hate being late
oh gosh lol thats so funny. 
I am a pretty trusting person also. 
Its okay to trust but always be cautious too.
That really sucks! Have you put up any posters to help you find him?
Well I hope you find him. Hopefully nothing bad happened to him.
Oh yeah those lines can be super long. What did you do?
Oh no that is terrible. What happened to all your things?
Oh no thats horrible.. July is not the time for that! Do you have someone ready to come out and fix it yet?
Thats good to hear how hot is it where you are?
Oh man good for you! I would have caved for sure. Pizza is my life
So true. I always eat it all. I really cant control myself so better not to even start. Good on you
Wow thats awesome what kind of car did you get?
That was a good choice did you consider any other makesmodels ?
Dont blame you there i remember by kid getting his first shots.  He was so upset and wouldnt stop crying.
I got lucky there he was fine after we got him away from the doctors office and got him his very treat.
Yay!!! Congrats! Thats so exciting im really happy for you
You will! I believe in you. Just go with a flow and take one day at a time. Your baby will love you so much
You should read the instructions before you start.. You need to work off the prompts.. But hello
Yes. I did go to college but I did not complete it.
I hate when that happens!
Im happy for you. I have been in that situation before.
Well even going by yourself you can always have a good time especially with alcohol involved! Did you end up having fun?
Thats when you drink more and talk to everyone around you and make a good time for yourself!
Uh oh.. Definitely not where you wanna go if you dont like clowns! Were you afraid while you were there?
Thats terrible! Did you make it through the entire show?
Awh man that stinks.. I never watched it before.. Im assuming you really liked it?
Yep why is it always with the good tv shows that it happens!?
Congrats! Hard work really does pay off.
I can only imagine how excited you must of been when you got the promotion.
There are a bunch of people who really dont! I dont get really why people are afraid of it though.
Yeah I guess I can see why that would frighten some people.. Nightlights work wonders!
Yes I think everyone was shocked! The real question is were you happy?
Thats awesome.. Hopefully they win again in the future!
Did you enjoy it?
I bet that was fun and relaxing
That sounds definitely terrifying! Did you figure out what it was?
Hmm.. I guess it is still July so it makes SOME sense at least! Did you ever confront them?
That is great your studying paid off.
In what college did he go?
Oh thats awesome! I am glad he made it!
I suppose I have. Why did you go to Texas?
Oh no! Were you all by yourself?
ohh! that is frighting. Didnt you scare?
Yeah! I am glad he didnt bite you or something!
Cool. Where are you going?
Ive been to Cozumel. It was lots of fun
It is nice. School can be very exciting.
Are they happy to go back to school?
Why were they fun
Yeah its not safe at all
Yeah. I know that feeling. although I had to buy my own.
I know. What kind of car was it
Parents can be awesome sometimes. Do you still play baseball?
Whos your favorite team?
Thats a great way to start
good luck going forward
Why would you do that
I guess we all were though
Im sorry to hear that. Losing family is always tough
I recently lost my grandmother. I thought I wouldnt get through it at all.
What did you get
I understand time is important
Thats awesome. Was he the first in your family?
Did he get a god job?
Wao how did you felt? did you work hard in that project?
IWhat was your project about? it was for school or something?
Where did you guys go?
Thats cool! I thought theyd only be around for Halloween.
I hope you get it also! What type of position is it?
Thats great! how soon until you hear back?
Well ... I put myself in your place and I admire you because it is something very emotionally tense
Now you must take the corrective so that it does not happen to you anymore
Oh no. What happened?!
I havent tried uber for important places. Not I know to be weary. So sorry to hear that.
Oh no. Did you lose your job then?
Maybe they can put you in a different department.
Oh wow. Are you a parent?
You must be proud.
That is a real blessing. Being debt free is gonna be sweet!
Im glad to hear that. If you can get through that you can get through anything together.
What matters is that you both learned from it.
Oh wow. That is not something you hear everyday!
Your friend must really like the woman. 
Im sure you are going to miss her.
Will you be able to communicate through social media?
Oh wow. Kid is crazy!
Oh man that must be a horrible feeling.
There is always next year champ. Im sure youll try harder next time.
Thats so bad. You must be feeling bad
I am surprised at their behavior. Did you ask for a refund?
That is quite an achievement! How did you do it?
I bet their were struggles and you learned a lot. Do you have any tips for me?
Thats exciting! How old is she?
Oh my god. Shes so little. I hope shell enjoy it.
Oh no thats awful. When did this happen?
I hope the worst didnt happen to them thats so sad.
Wow thats really nice. Are you going to wear it?
It mustve been a great guy.
Wow nice! What are you going to do with it?
It is a lot of money. Take your time deciding on what to do with it.
Thats good news.  Is her cat microchipped?
How long has the cat been missing?
I bet that was scary! Did you like it?
Were you ever scared? 
Are you ok?
Is your vehicle damaged?
Did you try to find who it belonged to?
I understand I hope you do something special with it then! Its always exciting to get a little extra cash even only 20.
Oh no! Are they even allowed to do that?
That really sucks. I hate how employers expect us to work to death.
Oh wow. Glad that person helped you out there. 
Glad to hear theres still some good people out there.
Was that difficult? And is it your extended family or your immediate family?
I know that can be really tough. Sometimes though it can strengthen communication  hopefully theyve been able to visit?
That sounds kind of suspicious.
Oh no. Did anything happen?
How do you respond to the girls who are hitting on you?
Seems like you might be enjoying the attention.
Thats definitely concern. Is there no more room for advancement at  your current job?
I hate to say it but I think that ship has sailed.  Shes either dead or not your girlfriend anymore. 
Oh no. Im so sorry to hear that and glad people at your church are there for you.
hahaha must be some really great cookers. How many kids do you have?
That is so tough. I always feel bad when people have a hard time conceiving because it was so easy for me.
I have 4 kids. I wish you all the best of luck and will pray for you. Kids are so much fun. Mine are all almost grown now.
That sounds very exciting  if nervewracking! How did it go for him? And you 
That is the best feeling seeing hard work pay off! You much have been so happy for and proud of him!
Oh no what kind of damage was done?
Did you tell her? She may want you to go ahead and get it fixed.
Mustve felt really nostalgic.
Do you get to see your mom often?
That sucks.  If it makes you feel even slightly better  the dumbest most imcompent coworker I have makes more than me... because you know.. nepotism.
Yeah its infuriating.
Oh no. Im so sorry.
I hope time will heal and they dont lose hope.
Why did you cheat on her? 
Sometimes it feels good to get revenge
How did you get the raise?
What did you do that got you the promotion? 
thats great it always nice to be encourage.  Really like it when my co workers do it
glad to hear it.
you are such a nice person.  Hopefully you helped.
That is a bummer.  On the bright side you probably wont do that again!
That is awesome!  It is nice to know people can be fair!
Sounds terrible how did she get in the accident?
What did she say after waking up?
thats awkward where was it?
from what you have told i cant go there what else did you see 
Are you sick? What happened?
Thats terrible. I hope you get some rest.
That sounds like a happy homecoming! Or was it bittersweet?
Thats a great feeling. Knowing you can go home again  Hopefully they can come visit you too!
Oh thats nice! Most people dont adopt older dogs
Mostly medical. But also that you most likely wont have long to make a bond play etc. It would be mostly care
Oh no. Did you explain it to him?
Youll be more careful next time. Everyone makes mistakes.
Why do you usually bring him along?
How far away was it? 
Oh man! Im so sorry! Is there any part of the season you can still enjoy? 
Do your parents feel terrible about that? Not that you want them to....I just imagine theyd be pretty devastated to know thats why a holiday was ruined for you. On the other hand  I LOVE New Years!
Why did he lie?
What did he say for the reason?
Why is she the love of your life?
How does she complete you?
Were you scared?
What movies do you enjoy instead?
That is nice of her did you have fun?
Who was all there?
oooh really do ghosts exist 
i used to but nowadays i dont what else
Who won instead?
Did you bet on the game? 
That is amazing! I went to college for a few years never ended up graduating.
I studied hard for a while but in the end it was just too much fun to party every weekend.
You should not do that anymore.
Can you retake it?
Thats too bad. All you can do is try harder next time.
Did you say something?
Did you say anything to the clerk?
Did you say something to the clerk?
Was there damage?
Was there anyone else around?
Did it turn out ok?
What was the puzzle of?
hahaha i can see hoe students laughed at you
ahw that was good
What about 3?
I have never been to Asia.
something wrong with your meal or what
can you kick an innocent dog for nothing
That isnt very nice.
What about 4?
Were you afraid or thrilled or both?
Were you in the water?
That is terrible news.
How did you do it?
That is wonderful! I actually won the lottery once myself and it changed my life for a bit.
oh no! That is terrible. I didnt give anyone any money either. 
That must be a good feeling.
I use to go to church when I was little.
Was it something that you could ignore?
What did you do?
That sucks. I am sorry for your loss.
Maybe you should get a new one.
Happiness comes and goes. it could change at any time.
As long as you take care of it and use it the right way it will last you forever.
Oh that does not seem very nice.
Yes she and I have a bond that will be unbreakable.
Why did you think that?
What makes you qualified?
Oh no! I did that last month. I still feel bad. Get them a gift to say sorry.
Give him a call too. It is a bit more personal.
I always try and order my food and get it delivered.
There a bunch of apps that let you buy food online you should check it out!
That is a great idea for when emergencies happen!
Yes that is a smart plan. Knowing that we cannot foresee the future it is a good idea to be prepared.
Oh no where to? That is hard.
Well at least there is sand!
Why is that? Are you scared of something in the water?
I was pleased and shocked at the same time I will take it!
Oh no! Im so sorry!
That is not fun. Hopefully it will not be too hard.
I expect that too but it is not always the case.
Yes you do. You can do it!
Thats great to hear. Did you have to wait a long time to get it?
Oh well I am very happy for you. I bet you were celebrating when you heard the good news!
After the interview was over I though it went very well. I am so confident I will get the job any day now!
Thats awesome! I love dog sitting no matter the occasion!
That sounds like a good way to have fun and get some exercise!
Awesome! Ive never been able to sit that long so getting really good at video games is hard for me
Thats neat. I wish I had your motivation for...well...everything else in life.
What is that?
Nice how much did you get for it?
That is so thoughtful of him did you guys catch a ball? 
I am sure it was!  
tell me more about this
but i would less satisfied
Tell him to get out and do something! That must be frustrating. 
Its hard being a parent... but i am sure you are doing it right! 
I love peruvian food! What did you make?
That green sauce with the cilantro and the jalepenos is the best! What is lomo?
Yum! I have all the ingredients for the chicken I might make that now instead of the bbq chicken thanks for the idea. 
Oh wow sorry to hear that was really rude of her.
Some people can take things so far. I hate it when they do that.
I am the type of person that gets what I have to buy and get out of the store. 
proud parent right  do you miss her during the year ?
one day my child will make me proud like that
thats a lot of kids god bless
Going good...whats up with you.
So how did  you do? Did the hard work pay off for you?
Holy cow. I hate when that happens. It happens a lot here since I live near the ocean. How did it end up?
Wow how lucky. How did you end up thanking that person?
Where are you moving to?
I love California.
Cool who were they up against? 
why would you do that
I am not sure I get it
I love it when teachers are down to earth and easy to get along with. What did you like most about him?
Thats pretty cool. Do you guys still keep in touch?
Sorry to hear that. I hope youve had good teachers since then.
Im sorry to hear that. Did something happen to make you miss them?
Oh no! That is hard I have the same issue. How far away did you move?
Omg! I am the same way... i always end up putting my list down while shopping. Where are you going? 
Thats so kind of them! 
oh man im sorry to hear that! We all make mistakes though so its okay. dont be hard on yourslef
its okay though im sure you learned from your mistake
i know how you feel. Im sorry to hear youre going through this. I just got food stamps so i can buy food for me and my son
I encourage you to apply for it no matter what
Its a good time to jog right now in the morning. good for you! 
I know it does I am right in FL! I dont jog I work out but running isnt my thing. 
What kind of risk are you taking?
Yikes thats stressful. How big is the family?
I am so sorry. You must be heartbroken.
How long was he part of your life?
Did the dog bark at him?
That sounds terrible. Sorry to hear that. What exactly happened?
Thats the worst when you personally know someone that treated you badly. I hope things turn out better for you. 
oh no.. are you upset? 
awh thats good it turned out well afterall 
Yeah I think most people feel that way but its still a valid feeling. How did it end up?
thats great to hear! Did you have any cool teachers or make any new friends?
I bet that was a little scary
Oh well I am sure most people forgot about it quickly
Thats awesome! Im glad you persisted because that is so important these days not being able to swim is a real danger!
Yes sounds like your doing a great job with the little guy!
Oh no did it take you a long time to figure out what the issue was?
Dogs can be a little squeamish when it comes to that sort of thing. I wouldnt feel bad it could happen to anyone!
I know you are over the moon. What did you have?
Enjoy every minute with him. Time goes fast when they are little.
That is horrible so sad.
Yes fire prevention shouldnt be that hard.
Wow! Im so envious! How long ago did you buy it?
Makes sense. when you know what you want you should go for it. Well Im happy for you. Im far away from being able to do that.
I bet you had a wonderful time together
how fun! Where did you guys go?
That is good to hear less weight the better
The loud roars also make my dog shake and run to the basement
My dog never used to do that it was only just recently that he started doing that.
Oh no was anoyone hurt?
That is good news I hope your car is ok.
You must have been so proud of their hard work.
Was it a large graduating class?
Wow I am glad you got help that could have been a lot worse
That is so sweet of him those are the people we need more of in the world
how was the experience?
It was good you got over the fear do you ride roller coasters more now?
Oh my gosh thats terrible. How did that happen
Thats one of my worst fears when I drive to my girlfriends parents house. So everything ended up being okay though?
what do you think your score was?
Ah thats a good score.  When i took the LSATs about 1516 years ago I received a 156 i believe.  Where do you hope to go to school?
I too was surprised.  To leave the team again sort of upset me.
He is a legend in the making
I feel the same way. The times you spend with family should be cherished forever.
I agree be grateful for those in your life because they help you become a better person.
Congratulations?  How much did you win?
Wow.  Now you can spoil yourself
He already left for the Lakers.
He technically is from Akron not Cleveland.
That is sweet of him marriage can be tough at first so at least he is trying
That is true marriage is great in a vaccuum but life pops the bag sometimes
Was it a long campaign?
I bet it did
Lebron isnt a saint though
how did you do?
were you able to retake it?
That is great did you spend it on anything cool?
That is smart as well future you will appreciate that!
I am happy that you have someone to share your life with.
Keep the faith that it will continue.
Thats seriously impressive. Sounds like a lot of work though. Hope it all works out. Are you nervous?
Well you sound confident. And applying and getting in is one of the toughest steps so Im sure youll do fine.
Wow. That is great.  Not everyone can say that.
Most struggle in their first year.  That is amazing that you did so well.
I am an older student too so I hope things go well for me in school.
Oh no did the relative say what happened? That sounds fishy.
Its an easy mistake to make were supposed to trust family you know?
Thats great.  I love taking the kids to Disneyworld.  What do you want to see most?
Yea you wont be disappointed.  Its wonderful there.
I am sure you were happy
All that hard work was worth it I am sure
Making a change can be hard. Did you take the offer?
Its always best to do nothing if your not sure.
were you able to do any extra credit to bring up the grade?
That stinks. Theres always next time!
Oh very interesting. Im not a fan of the owner either. Why do you feel that way though?
Thats a fair point. But Lebron James is different and probably seeks to try to really control the team he is on so that can be difficult too
how long have you two known eachother?
I think you just need to give it time. Hopefully she will come around.
What were you thinking? Have you been thinking it over for a long time?
Was she keeping him in her classroom? I can see how that can be a lot of work.
Thats nice. Hard to find nowadays.
I know. I wish things were better!
I do too honestly I used to play all these fun games with our neighbors late summer nights it was amazing but I took it for granted
I hear you there that is the worst part!
I remember those games too. What kinds did you play? My favorite was flashlight tag.
Ghost in the graveyard was a blast! I cant believe I forgot that one. It sounds like we both had great childhoods.
I get that I am not sure how some of these people can afford the places they go!
Yeah that is not me at all I barely post anything to people online
How exciting for you. What kind of car is it?
That was so generous of them.
That is not nice! People do that all the time as long as the person they tell is closer to them
Everyone believes that of course but I believe you people make mistakes
Ugh I remember those days! All the shopping making sure to look good for the first day! good times
Me too I am looking forward to winter and christmas much better in my opinion!
congratulations. marry her
then maybe you should cheat.
I am sure you are that sounds bad
There are just bad people out there
That takes a lot of strength to be able to do that. A lot of people would just break down instead of trying to help however they can.
Good for you Im sure your dad is so very thankful for you.
Yikes did anything out of the ordinary happen?
That is weird sorry to hear that paying more money is never fun at all
Wow thats awesome.
Why so surprised
I know exactly what you mean.
It makes it hard to communicate though.
I am sorry to hear that how did it end between you?
That makes sense sometimes things are just not meant to be
that is no good I am sorry that happened to you
It happens I suppose maybe there is some sort of refund policy where you bought it from
WOW! Why do people have to be violent... ugh 
right me either. its too bad but glad you are thinking right! 
Oh no. Not another Lebron story.
I know. He is a great player though.
sorry to hear that.
Where are you headed to?
Oh well that sounds like it will be a ton of fun I hope all goes well!
Oh no! How old were you at the time?
Thats like a bad dream scenario. Better to be a little kid though even if kids are mean.
Please dont care about those people. Try to be true to yourself. World will recognize you one day.  
Exactly. Youre right. Ignore them. 
Have you been married a long time?
I know that had to hurt. But forgive her and let her make it up to you.
Dads can be strange like that sometimes. Was he trying to be malicious about it or just having fun?
What did he used to do?
Why did things end between you?
Oh yeah I understand that it is the same way with my girlfriend now
I was just saying the same thing.
Im only 34 and a lot of my old friend are dead.
Was your previous neighbor good at least?
Ah well at least you can only meet or exceed expectations!
Why did it make you feel awkward?
Oh well I am sure the date was just happy you were there!
Thats a shame  Im glad that youve got friends now though. Why was that?
I thikn lots of people are shy until they find where they belong.
i bet you did did you want a boy instead of a girl?
That is a good mindset I wish you the best of luck with that!
how did it happen?
how did you get into trouble?
I understand that he seemed to seal his own fate there but still sad
Potentially he seemed a bit deadset but we do not know too much all in all
how much do they run?
damn.. how times have changed..
Was it Roseanne?
Me too. What show are you talking about?
That can be a hard situation to deal with. Any chance of moving?
Good for you. Just hang on best you can until your in a better place.
Aww that is so sweet! Im sure you were very happy
Oh yeah definitely! She seems like a very good girlfriend to do that for you. Sounds like yall have a good future ahead.
Oh no... maybe you can get it fixed asap so no one will be upset? 
I am sure it was glad its fixed 
How does it hold up now?
well that is good that seems rare!
The results for what?
Well best of luck I am sure you did awesome!
Childhood is a boon and it never be taken again. But everyone wishes to do so. 
Me too. Try to spend time with kids. We can get into their life for sometime.
well theres only one way to find out!
yea everyone probably does at one point or another.
Oh no! I would have too. Did you find him?
Oh... Interesting. A hole under the fence? Im sorry to hear that.
thats amazing.. im happy for him too.. i bet you are proud 
thats to be expected but you seem like a caring person 
Wow thats terrifying.get really big? Did it 
That is crazy lucky. Well Im glad everything ended up okay.
Oh that sounds very exciting! What kind of car?
That is so awesome! Happy for you!
That is nasty did it get on anyone else? that would not be fun
That is so nasty I am glad I was not there
wow ! thats really awesome. What kind of car did you get?
what? thats absolutely horrble
Shock? Uh oh what happened? Is everything okay?
Ohhh... That makes more sense. Well congratulations. Thats a defining point in peoples lives. I hope you have a great experience.
im sorry.. distance sucks. luckily you guys have skype! 
I know because sometimes technology doesnt work the way we want it too.. i hope you get to be together again soon. 
how did it go?
how did you make up for it?
Did you find him?
How long has it been? I am so sorry. That must be so difficult.
No!!! gross... did you flip? 
i am sure it wasnt 
Hah... I have a teenage sister. I can agree. But they can have their good moments. I hope for the best for you.
With the way you sound Im sure youll have the patience and the wisdom to raise her the right way through the teenage years anyway.
Congrats!!! Do you already have a job lined up? 
thats so awesome good for you 
Dont we all!  Work is often times one of the most stressful things in life.
Where do you suppose you would like to take a break at?
Thats a large amount of money!
He is a Superbowl caliber QB so I guess he deserves it.
What happens Tuesday?
Nice how much will you get?
that is so cool! omg beautiful.. what part of france? 
im sorry  how long has he been missing for? 
im sorry to hear that. how long ago was it?
I can only imagine.  i hope it has gotten a little easier for you?
Oh wow that was nice of your friend that is not a fun situation to be in
Well that is a true friend right there then!
Thats nuts do you know if they are ok?
Ah ok. Thats crazy though. Hope they are ok.
Have you called animal control? What about putting up flyers?
Maybe someone found her and took her in.
Were you able to help? How scary for that child!
Thats good. I am glad it was a happy ending.
I know youre not asking for advice but... DONT. Just dont.
ahhhhhh! I see this on Judge Judy everyday!
My anxiety would have been having anxiety  so I feel you... hows the dog doing today? 
Awh.. if shes okay today she will be fine! 
I bet youll be fine if you work hard enough. What language is it?
I feel that way sometimes but its the best way to learn and it only gets easier!
That is so sad.. im sorry! ugh... i hope you can find peace. 
what a cute name... i am sure you will.. again im sorry! 
At least you feel bad about it?
how how are you going to spend it? or are you a saver?
thats a good choice
Eek!  I hate spiders!  Did you kill it?
Oh no!  Thats too bad.  Now you will have to keep an eye out for it!
Did it go well for you then?
Its great when it works out that way I hate presenting.
You should take it somewhere then
You need to save up then
Did he give you tips for getting the best deal?
Thats really sweet Im happy for you
I feel that sometimes I feel lucky to survive single days!
Why this one in particular?
That is great which one?
When do you start?
So what happened?
I am glad to hear that it seems like a lot of work
that is wht i have heard i hope it is that way for me
It can happen.Were you better prepared for the next one?
It can be a hard lesson to learn but will make you a better student.
My cousin bought a really pretty shirt that I had been wanting
No I can but I didnt want her to have it and not me.
I understand.. i wish life could be eaiser! Im sorry.. whats going on? 
sounds like a lot of stress... i hope things change for you VERY soon! 
Oh no I hope you feel better soon. Do you want to talk about it?
Im so sorry. Have you tried reading Rainbow Bridge that could provide some comfort.
wouldnt that be cool and your bestfriend would be kevin 
What did she do for your birthday?
I understand that completely I still have a bit of time to wait
I get that sometimes it is not in the cards though
Did you get in?
That is nice of him that is a good dad right there!
oh I am sorry to hear that he passed away...
How do they help
They sound like good people
Me too I dislike heat but I love the leisure
Me too that made summer great as a kid!
That is good you met your girlfriend where did you meet?
Where did you go to college.
Nothing wrong with that.
No only one extra day isnt bad.
IS that a real thing?
Wow. The first one is so old now.
Thats amazing!  How much did you win and what did you buy with it?
Smart move!  Good for you for deciding to use it responsibly.
Thats so sweet! Always a special moment how old is she?
I bet you are so proud!
I can understand that. My husband went to a friends to work on his car. Im home with 5 kids!
Ha ha! No loneliness here. I think the biggest worry is craziness.
oh how sad how did you lose your car?. Public transportation is not every ones cup of tea..
you guys will get back everything you have lost. It is difficult for travel as you said
oh no that is unfortunate. are you alright?
wow you might just have bad luck
i would just take an uber from now on if i were you.
Thats sounds so delicious.  How did it turn out?
Did everyone else enjoy your new found passion for cooking?
Thats always a great holiday. What did you do to celebrate?
Sounds like a great time! Did you celebrate with family or friends?
Im super bummed out. I worked really hard for this promotion and I ended up not getting it.
Im not sure my boss wont return my request for a meeting emails.
Im excited personally I guess you have to like your school and what youre studying.
I hate writing papers too. Thats why I am an engineering major. Lol its still pretty hard though.
I bet you are excited for that
Yeah its always hard to leave in those situations. Are you flying to see her?
I live near the beach too! It really is great. Although Ive been out of town for a while so I havent been to it yet this summer. Im glad you got to go there.
Only thing Im not wild about is dealing with cleaning up afterwards.
Why werent you able to do it?
Oh man that sucks do you feel bad about it?
Im sure if you apologize hell understand at least a little. Were you just really busy or something?
Sometimes people say things they dont mean when their angry. Maybe you should just let it go.
Well you both have the same blood so I would advise just to let bygones be bygones.
thats awesome love the positive vibes. good for you! 
good paying job and keeps you active! 
Whoa... thats awesome. I love hearing that. Can you tell me about them?
Absolutely. Im glad youre experiencing that. Me on the other hand Id be worried that I wasnt good enough for them. But Im sure things will work out for you.
Yes it is... when can you see her again? 
well i hope you two get to spend a lot of time together when she comes up 
That sounds like trouble. What exactly is going on?
Dang! Im not a parent but I have siblings who have done the same and of course Ive done it to my parents too. Any idea what youre going to do?
Oh my!  I have never heard that before.  I hate feeling that powerless but it is bound to happen many more times unfortunately
That sounds shady.  Did it ever get worked out?
That is very discouraging.   I am sorry you have to deal with that stress.
Oh that is terrible! Kids are so mean! What did you do?
I hope that it only gets better.
What happened to make it that way
Yeah that sucks I have gone through that too
Yes its hard to see people you know and care about struggling.  Are they doing better?
Thats great to hear!  I hope it stays that way and whateer troubles they had are subsided
Thats great! Are you getting better at driving?
Are you going to buy a car?
Thats good to hear and do
I hate being late
How did you do?
Thats great! Congrats!
That is outstanding!  I bet you are excited!
That is great news and a lot to be proud of!
That is the greatest feeling in the world to see them smiling.
I do.  A childs laugh takes away all of lifes stress.
I would be scared of that
I am not sure I am ever prepared
So why didnt you end up going?
It happens to everyone youll feel better about it soon
Wow that can be stressful Why were you happy?
Maybe she should have just quit! but i hope the best for her in the future.
indeed the future could be bright for her.
when are they?
oh did you lose it somewhere?
Good you got it back.
Ah that is no good! Why didnt you get to leave early?
I know what that is like! I hate being an adult sometimes!
wow congrats how long have you worked there?
I feel like since the show catfishing has decreased a little bit. Its easy to determine when someone is using fake pictures.
I have and it didnt go so well for me. I hope your experience is!
No I didnt thats pretty awesome lol...is that the show where celebrities get slimed
Thats cool I remember it was a big theme in Nickelodeon. Id be so embarrassed if I was the losing family...but Im sure they all got paid so it was worth
Was it a surprise?
That is so cool. I bet you were happy!
Im so sorry what happened?
You must be missing here very much.
I saw that.  It was pretty crazy!
What are your thoughts on that?
wow thats a good feeling to have
you seem to have done a good job. congrats
Well that sounds just wonderful! What kind of entrepreneur are you?
Youve sparked my curiosity on the last one haha!
Did you try talking with your supervisor 1 on 1?
Well I hope it works out for you.
That is really weird did he actually knock the tree down and how thick was the tree?
I wonder how long it would take him to kick through a large and wide tree.
Nice did your friend give you a piece?
Cool what kind of pizza was it
Thats awesome. You must be so proud of her!
Thats a good goal!  I recommend online dating if you are trying to meet many different women!
I hear eharmony is pretty good.  I have a couple friends who have had success with it.
I know the feeling of finish finals but not with all As. Congrats buddy!
What are your plans afterwards?
Awww man that stinks! I thought you two were going well.
Yeah but like 10 years of that committed time.
I agree people who catfish need to get their priorities straight.
Exactly looks are not the only think that matter in this world.
I sure hope they say YES with a very low interest rate. Will this be your first home?
A very exciting and scary time of life. I remember it well.
Fine what did happen at last?
Good. Is it a bike race?
Oh no. What happened?
Thats very kind of your manager. 
Being sick does stink at times. But at least your husband is there to assist when in need.
Hopefully your kids also understand and arent being a handful.
What was the game? That happens to me all the time too its a treat to remember such great times.
I remember that show! And the books! But I had no idea there was a game!
have you asked them? 
they seem like not very nice people! im sorry 
How much! Sometimes things happen like that when you really need them!
Wow I hate when people feel like its okay to waste other peoples time.
Im glad you are. You deserve to work for a company that values you and your time.
aww its amazing how fast time flies and how quickly kids grow up.
I think like that with my kids. This sounds cliche but its so bittersweet. 
did he lose it?
Boy thats pretty messed up.
Ouch seeing that news probably knocked your mood down hard.
Yeah that is like half a year of rent for me. I would be livid.
Im glad to hear it brought memories and not tears! Its hard losing a parent. 
yes we do i understand i lost both of my parents at 22 
Oh really? Is there any specific reason why?
Thats great! Do you have good days often?
Thats awesome! Gotta take credit for those genes haha
haha thats cool...always good to have the best of both worlds
I absolutely agree with that mind set! Pick something youre passionate about and do it with passion!
Im a fitness enthusiast myself and youd be surprised how people even find reason to be negative about THAT.
About what exactly?
What did he need it for?
Why do you hide it?
Why is that considered more attractive?
It must have felt good to see him after such a long time.
A brothers bond is unbreakable. Im glad you guys got to spend some time together. 
They are just kids I think you should give them toys to play with and also take a pain killer
 we have all being through the age. You will miss this stage when they finally grow to become adult
I think so! That sounds like you worked so very hard for the company!
Have you tried to talk to him?
I am glad that it is
Its nice to have things like that happen
Where was it to?? 
Ive never been in an eating contest! How much jello did you eat to win? 
What was the prize for winning? 
Wow thats kind of cool. 
Yeah those are rough when you are so hopeful about it.
Yeah hopefully your still looking for another internship.
I bet.. what did she pass away from? 
ugh thats terrible im sorry for your loss 
I hope she is okay
I bet good luck though
So many people are.
I totally agree. Why do you think some people really like him though.
Did you call to complain?
Less salt is always better than to much salt on food.
Im sorry to hear that. Why would you considering putting it on hold?
Yeah raising kids is very tough. I do hope everything works out for you. Just find a way to keep your motivation up!
That is disappointing.  I wonder if you can see if anyone you know is doing it and they can hype you up for it.  
That is no good!
oh no... will you tell them? 
i think so its for the best 
What job?  Dont be discouraged if you dont get it though!  Keep trying!
Everything happens for a reason.  When one door closes another one opens!
Woah! Thats super scary! Did it do anything to you?
So creepy...I wouldnt be able to forget it either...
I am sorry to hear that
That isnt too far
Is he okay now?
thats a good bond how long have you been together? 
very adorable good for you guys 
was that  the only time you stole in your life?
That was very cool of your dad.He taught you a lesson.
How is everything coming together? 
What did you want to happen exactly? 
That is sad
That makes me feel better
I bet that wasnt a great feeling.
I am assuming you did study hard for it right?
That sucks! Have you been able to contact the bus company yet and get it back?
Oh no! Would your phone cost a lot to replace?
Im sorry to hear that. I hope it turns up.
Wow that was a long time ago I am sure that you regret it now and have learned from your mistake.
Thats good that your friend wasnt affected by your actions too badly. If you guys moved on from it then it was a great learning opportunity!
Its okay to stay at home
Tv can be fun though
Most kids are like that. I was definitely scared.
Most of us do that too. Kids over reacy to new environments
Dont be.I am sure you are ready.
We all are.
Awesome!  Where are you going!  I am jealous!
No I am really jealous!  I have wanted to go there for the longest time.  I am happy for you!
how thats cool.  
hard work must pay off if you are seeing results! congrats
That sucks to hear. I dont know too much about basketball to be honest. Was it really a big deal?
I hear a lot of people say that he must be real good. What team would you prefer to see him on?
So you are not anymore?
Did you graduate?
Why does he do that
I guess thats a reason
That is extremely lucky.  Its nice to know there are still good people in the world.
Wow.  That sure saved you a lot of money on replacing a phone too!
Oh no really that really sucks to hear. Why were you not able to go?
It is sad that you can not go but you are making a good sacrifice to make sure your family will be able to survive. Also you could use the alone time to do stuff you are not able to do with them around!
I am sorry they are sweet animals
That is adorable
oh i hope she got better
well thats great news!
Why did she break up?
Did she give you a reason why she didnt love you anymore?
Thats bad. I feel sorry for you 
Oh god. Thanks. I feel care for you. 
I felt the same way. 
Are they coming back soon?
That is never a good thing to do
You will get through it
Surely not do you trust her. 
Then I wouldnt be worried you cant live your life that way. If someone wants to cheat they will find a way. 
Congratulations! It mustve been a very happy day for you and your family.
I could imagine. I one day hope to experience that feeling.
Oh? How did you find him?
Oh he must be a good boy then or girl.
what happened to it?
Why are you happy
That is nice to hear
Im so sorry to hear that.
I lost my grandmother last year. It is a rough thing to go through.
I am very sorry to hear about your loss. take you were very close.
I am sure she is in a better place now.
That is great to hear!  Part of being successful is being confident and you sure sound confident!
Try to be confident but not overly entitled.  There is a fine line between the two.  Congrats though if you get the job!
Wow that must have been a terrifying experience. Are you ok now?
That is good that you escaped your accident with a minor injury. Please take care of yourself in the future!
I am sure that will be fun
I bet you have a lot of good times
I could imagine! How do you lose your dog?
Oh wow! Those dogs are smart! What did you change to make sure it doesnt happen again?
wow im sorry to hear that. you still stay in contact?
Wow what did they say about skipping it?
probably wont forgive him for a long time.
I bet that was stressful
I am sure they did not mind doing that
Howd he get out?
Oh man I hope you werent too hard on the kids.
wow thats awesome
sounds like you will be using that often
Yes but I will be sad when it ends.
I cant wait to find out the end of the series.
Thats sad did you move away from your parents?
Im sorry to hear that. That would be hard. 
Did he just come back to you?
That is pretty great! My dog takes forever at time because hes playing with the neighbors dogs.
oh no did you ever get caught
did you learn your lesson?
I bet you were poor pup
That is good to hear
Oh my gosh! Did you run and hide?
I dont live in an area that is known for tornadoes but they still scare me. Im glad youre ok!
Oh gosh I hope so too!
I guess you got to just wait and see.
wow thats cool!
i bet that night was fun!
Did it get resolved
Well that sucks sorry
Well you should always think that. Its not hard once you get into the groove of it.
Hopefully you do go to college. I had fun but was stressful.
I guess guys tend to do that
Forward isnt always good
How old were you? That can be dangerous you hear stories of people falling in all the time.
Id be scared too!
I am sorry to hear that.  Have you tried looking for him.
What kind of dog do you have?
what position did you play
because of my illness i got some frustration too
family is much needed thing during these time. take care of your health
Wow I sure beat he beat your butt I bet you thought you had it in the bag rigtht?
Hahaha that just goes to show ya age is just a umber!
For sure. Trust is a key driver in having a good relationship with anyone. If you cant trust people then you will feel like you are alone a lot.
I agree with that. You should be able to trust people until they prove that they are untrustworthy. 
how often do you eat it?
Dogs can be bad. Did he come home?
Weve all been there. How did you do?
That was nice. That doesnt always happen.
Yeah that does make you feel good. But make sure its a good charity.
I like those too especially when i dont want change anymore.
Well dang! Are you feeling alright?
I had an experience like that before  one that I never want to live again. How is the driver?
Oh goodness I bet that made you jealous!
Wow! Im glad it didnt escalate to that point!
I bet that tasted good
Oh well at least it was something
It was a huge achievement when I graduated too. Did you get good grades?
Nice. Did you go onto to university?
what do you think happened to it?
Well that sounds really sad. How long was he missing for?
Did you ever find him?
Oh man! I hate big storms too. Was it as bad as a hurricane?
Well thats good. Did you lose any shingles from your roof?
did you say something?
wow thats cool
Thats an awesome experience. How was the wedding?
Did they have an awesome catering service? I am looking one for my wedding that is coming up
How do you like it so far
I am sure you will
Yes. And in the closet too
MY cousins used to play scary tricks on me. I hated that.
Thats awesome! Were you invited to the wedding?
Do you know your coworker very well? What do you think youll get them for a gift?
How far away does she live?
Wow that is pretty cool of her to do.
I bet you were proud
That is great to hear
why dont you tell them to stop?
yea i coud understand that
That is great news!  Was he lost?
That has definitely got to be a relief that he is back!  That is the best case scenario.  Hopefully he never gets away again.  Make sure to check your fence!
oh wow. did you clean it up
wow that stinks
What happened to him? Did he run away?
Oh wow. Did you put posters up all over the neighborhood to find him?
oh wow congrats
i wish i could go back to get another degree. thats great that you were able to do that
Thank god! Was your dog missing?
haha dogs always want to go out and play.
Hopefully another position opens up! Im so sorry to hear that.
That sounds so gross! Did you try any yourself?
Likewise! I even too terrified to try sushi. It just looks so slimy.
Wow that is very annoying. What will you do clean the carpet?
That is good idea.
Summer was so much fun! What did you usually do with your cousins?
I used to be an outdoorsy person myself. Did you guys ever go to the pool?
Im so sorry! Have you complained at all?
Thats unfortunate. I hope that something changes soon. It is detrimental to your health!
haha so what are they like now?
I hope you taught them that it doesnt!
Ill be your friend
I used to have a had time making friends when I was younger. 
Thats great! How old are you.
Youre never too old to have fun! Dont ever think that. Always stay a kid at heart
Awwwww thats so sad to here. Where did you rescue her from?
I would have done the same thing! Who does that guy think he is? I wouldve tried kicking him back.
Oh thats really bad!
That is just sad. People in education dying really sucks.
Thats cool. What did you guys all do?
I bed it was exciting just because of the idea of getting caught!
Oh wow! Wasnt expecting that. But kissing your girlfriend is hardly something to be shamed of.
Maybe someone is playing a trick on you
Set a trap. Or maybe just a camera
Hows it going with that?
hahaha Ive been that way too.
No but Ive had my hours so reduced that it wasnt working going to work due to everything going to union dues and transportation.
Oh thats never any good. Did the group see you do anything embarrassing?
Well that does sure sound like a show. I bet they shared a bunch of laughs over those wretched and foul farts.
hm never tried baked salad. Howd it go Ramsey?
Well you get experience points on that. Hopefully the next dish is better.
Its been raining hard here in Virginia too. Did you get whisked away in a flash flood?
Some days trapped inside the house arent always bad. At least you dont have to think too hard on what to do.
That is good! What work do you do there?
Must find some cool things while doing it.
Thats horrible. Did they divorce?
Of course! betrayal is horrifying to go through. I hope he became a better man for it?
Thats so sweet.
Was it for your birthday?
I hope I work with nice people like that one day.
There is so much different kinds it can be daunting sometimes on where to find the good stuff.
Oh wow. I would suggest using Spotify and then make a radio playlist on your favorites artists. That is how I find newer but similar music.
Sometimes it takes a while to really hone into your preferences. 
A for creativity.
Never ventured nothing gained and all.
Seems like things turned out for the better. What is she going to do with the winnings?
Sounds like the responsible thing to do. Hopefully she gets a new one soon and her luck continues.
How exciting! Where is your friend originally from?
So awesome! Has she ever been to America before?
That is good stuff.  I bet that made you feel good!
You are so much fun!  Jogging gives off a pretty good feeling too!
I hate that too! Do you make him clean it up?
Thats a tough situation to be in. I would just take all his belongings to the dump and be done with it. Maybe he can stay there too.
Yea you can do whatever you want.
Thats for sure. How long have you had your independence?
I dont like vacations that make you feel like you are still at home. Where do you live?
Awwwww poor little doggie. Did you end up helping the poor thing?
Thats good! Small dogs like that make excellent companions. Do you plan on keeping him?
Wow thats interesting. What do you do with it?
Oh no Well I am the opposite. I rescue bambi and small critters 
Thats too bad to hear. Whats wrong with her?
Thats incredibly awful. At least the surgery fixed the injury I assume. Did the doctors say when she is going to wake up?
Think Ive done that too. No regrets my friend.
They are tasty sins.
are they being loud and annoying like usual?
Ugh well good think mine are still at summer camp.
Whats game club
Sounds like a fun club though. My school didnt have anything like that.
Well congratulations! What will you be doing at your new billet?
You managed to get a promotion so youre obviously talented. Im sure you will do just fine and earn many more promotions.
Oh no how dare he! Doesnt he know that is forbidden
Thats so sad  Maybe he should buy you a substitute
that was nice of you
it could have been sentimental. like a gift from someone special
Wow. Howd that go?
That mustve been embarassing. Happens to us all.
Me too! I helped a guy with his immigration case and saved him from being deported. He ended up becoming a pastor.
He deserved it. He was fighting for his life.
Thats too bad. What seems to be wrong with him?
Doesnt sound good at all. Has anyone taken him to get it checked out?
Big Macs are heaven in your mouth.
I mean you can still go back for more after this. Dont give up bro.
I stayed at home  I hate trying to fight over that 50 off pack of pencils at Staples. What did you do?
Sounds like a swell purchase. Have you taught Big Brother Alexa to say any mischievous phrases?
Im sorry to hear that what led you to this?
Yea you need to stay away from those especially if you dont know who they are your email should be able to block stuff like that look in the settings.
Oh wow you must have a lot of responsibility there!
That sounds fun! You must be really happy about it. 
Awww... how long have you had him?
Why didnt it work out?
Oh well thats good.
Are you attending post secondary?
Thats awesome! What are you and your kids taking?
Thats cool! What band is it?
Fantastic! That would be so fun!
That sounds great. Was it a promotion or maybe a raise?
Oh I see. Well thats all very exciting. If you keep working at it Im sure you will continue to be successful. It will pay off.
O no! Thats a terrible thing to have happen or see.
Was the person ok?
Oh! What is it for? Just remember to think of all your good qualities and the interviewers 
Cool! What industry is it in? I hope you get the job!
What city are in right now?
Oh well be carreful.Make sure nobody is following you.
Oh wow. Well are you going to use it? Why are you ashamed?
Why did you buy it then?
Wow thats awesome. Congratulations
Did you like the food?
Can you explain more?
Donate is good thing to do. Great
That is so disgusting!
I probably would have done the same thing.
I am a teacher so I understand.  You must be working well with him!  Do teachers know what accommodations to make or how to differentiate for him to be successful in the classroom?
The amount of pride he will have in himself with speak volumes.  Let his new teachers know what works for him.  You are his best advocate!
That is awesome! What do you go to school for?
Well if you are doing so well I wouldnt quit! Good luck!
How sweet. How is it now?
It great that he has a good home then.
He must love his grandkids.
Ah well he raised your and your brother so he knows what hes doing.
Dont feel bad many people are experiencing the same feelings.  Try to focus on meeting new and interesting people!
Have you tried online dating?  Many of my friends have experienced success with apps like eharmony!
Thats not fair. Why didnt they split it up with more people.
Thats terrible. Maybe you can get a promotion if you get it all done.
That sounds pretty admirable. What kind of animal? Dog?
Yeah Im afraid to get a cat because you never know what kind of personality youll get with them
Thats very admirable.
Enabling is pretty bad. People dont learn if someone is always saving them from every thing.
Im about to watch it! Please dont spoil it. Im excited for it even though Ive only seen a couple of TV shows and movies based off of his books and only read a couple of the actual books
Yeah I like a lot of the actors theyve got for that show so Im really looking forward to it. Might save it to binge it though
Big dinners are always a great way to tie everything up at the end of the day. Was it a pretty long day for you?
Haha I bet! Always great to have everyone together though really gets your mind off all the stresses of daily life.
Im sorry. Are you sure you did that bad?
Theyll be other interviews.
What shows are you thinking of specifically?
I didnt realize it was ending? You must be disappointed.
Oh wow I hope you are fine!
Yikes. If I was you I would get my own gun! Better to have it and not need it then have not have it then need it!
payday is the best day! What are you doing to do?
OH wow! I feel you there and its totally worth it! If you have to sit get a donut pillow to not sit on your tailbone.
Oh thats horrible. Whos Brian Lawyer?
Ive never heard of him but that sucks. Howd he die?
Oh wow thats horrible.
What is the name of it?
I hear that stuff is bad for you.
Ohh no were you pulled over wrongly?
How fast did they say you were going?
Thats great news.
That is great news.
Did you really steal it or was it more like borrowing without asking first?
Hmmmm. with no job and no way to pay it back I sure hope he can be understanding.
What show was it?
Oh. Ive never seen that show. I know it has die hard fans though.
Thats a tough one. Do you eat out a lot? Thats usually the culprit. I had to learn how to cook for myself so I could afford to live.
Oh man thats doubly terrible! Yeah if you can you should try to make a budget and get better at cooking for yourself. Huge money saver but Im sure you already knew that. I hope it works for you though.
Those jobs are hard. You can always try it and see if you like it. I recommend a temp agency they often have nice desk jobs. Some even offer work from home jobs.
MOst work requires multi tasking. Yes that is true. You sound like you already have a good head on your shoulders.
thats terrible. Was it an expensive one?
No kidding... Who goes out of their way to get a lawnmower? Like... Why risk getting arrested and going to jail for a lawnmower... Oh well... Humanity. Sorry to hear that happened to you.
Im sorry to hear that I hope he is in a better place now! How old was he?
Oh wow I cant imagine losing my dad at 67. I hope you make it through these hard times stay strong!
Right on! Thats cool to hear. Everyone likes to rag on older people driving. Glad to hear shes the exception. What kind of car does she drive?
Haha... That sounds awesome. Wish I could carpool with her. I hate driving but it sounds like she loves it.
I have a friend who plans ahead like that.  Im a last minute gal.  I think you will be less stressed by planning ahead.
Not to mention enjoy the actual party too!  Are you celebrating anything in particular?
Oh my god I would have been so embarrassed! Howd you react?
So you left work at lunch time? Did you come back or were you too ashamed?
Yeah I mean things happen. Better to put it in the back of your head and keep trucking along.
Dang a whole two weeks? Going anywhere or just hanging out and really enjoying yourself at home?
Thats a good way to do it. especially because its easy to get those postvacation blues. Thats actually really smart
Good to hear youre confident! Im sure youll do well if youve been studying.
You dont have to tell me I know youll ace it! You sound well prepared.
Yeah everyone speeds. Terrible to get caught. Hopefully you werent speeding in a neighborhood were you?
Yeah I know. Adrenaline gets to you. Youre human. At least you were doing it in a sort of safe way it sounds like. Some cops are just out to get you.
Dont go check it out. That never turns out well in horror movies. Bring a gun then or another person.
I would do that! Or call a friend over Get a weapon too.
Yikes... sounds like they need to hire better people. Hopefully the noise isnt too loud in the morning
Man.. Good luck with that. Sounds like it will be hard to fight them. But I hope it works out for you.
That is lucky!
Im happy you got to avoid that!
Seriously? How? What was the mistake? Did you talk to him about it or your boss?
Thats sneaky... and hard to explain. Im sorry you have to deal with that hard situation. What do you think youll do about it?
Wap you must be disgusted with the farting. were you mad? or are you used to this kind of situations?
Yes i do have 2 siblings older brother and younger sister but we dont fart in front of eachother i love them!
Sounds like the good old days seemed more relaxing and care free.
Oh man! I grew up on that cartoon too!
Yeah... thats a tough one. Ive pirated stuff before. Kind of how it goes as a poor college student. Maybe when you get older you can pay for things appropriately.
Hahaha... Good point. I understand. Some things are just more important fair point. My fault on assuming your age.
Thats awesome the exact opposite is true for me. My little brother is just about to start his first year of college next month!
Yes I hope so. Well I hope your brother can put his degree to good use and make some moolah!
Who knows.. Ive dealt with slow internet all my life. Wish I could finally get a decent ISP.
Not really especially since they vary sometimes by region. We should just move to Europe I hear they have great internet there because they actually view it as important.
I am so sorry to hear that. I assume lots of folks close to you have entered eternity lately?
sadly we all know that everyone and everything is going to die but that is why we need to really live while we are able. Dont retreat. Embrace everyone who is close to you.
Thats so scary do you believe in ghosts?
Hope its a friendly one at least.
Haha.  Makes it hard to take care of business and youd think shed get the hint from the locked door!  I would have sat longer just because.
Maybe her first class seat should be on the royal porcelain seat!
You should put yourself out there and meet some new people.  Just start exploring the city and you are bound to meet others!
It is.  It isnt healthy to be by yourself for too long.  Humans are social creatures!
Wow no parent should ever abuse their children like that. Did you or anyone do anything?
Yea I totally understand where youre coming from. Hopefully someone nearby was able to call CPS or law enforcement.
Lol what a bummer. What happened?
Well there you go at least you a got a positive out of a negative situation haha!
Where did this happen?
Oh wow yeah that sounds gross! I agree with the wasted food too. There are starving people all around the world!
Oh no why were they closed?
Im sorry I know how much that stinks like when you really really want Chickfila and its Sunday...
Why would you always get fake checks? That would drive me crazy.
Well that was a surprise I bet.
O really? Any specific reason for this fear?
Flying scares a lot of people but its safer then driving over all.
I have to say that is a true blessing. I have a wonderful mother myself. Why do you say she is a good mom?
She sounds like a wonderful person.
Oh really congrats! yes when your kids acomplish something it is very happy for us parents!
Thats so cool do you have any othe children or just one? when you have more they are very competitive
He couldve killed you!
I really hate bad drivers. 
I know that can be hard.  How long has it been since youve been out with someone?
Yeah alot of times you just have to be reminded why you broke up.  I know there is someone out there for you just stay positive and they will come your way!
That must of been no fun.
Hopefully she doesnt do it again.
Im not too fond of them myself. Why dont you like them?
Yeah especially fire ants. Those are nasty little buggers.
Sweet was it a difficult test?
Yea same its nice to be out of school. All that learning pays off though!
Yea that is the worst. I dont understand how it can comeout of here mouth
I hope you just walked away dude. Nothing good can come of that. I bet you were furious.
Well that escalated quickly. Im hoping this is not real?
 That is messed up did heshe show any warning signs before their passing? Its not your fault by the way.
Did you hurt your self?
That wasnt nice of them.
Sorry for the bad news.
I know she will make it.
Congratulations! What are you doing to prepare for it?
That sounds like a lot of fun. What kind of cake did you select?
It probably stank a lot too.
You probably should have moved with a shovel of something instead of running over it
I am too! I am really not a fan on how he is handling relations with Russia. What makes him annoying to you?
I know right? Doesnt seem right. Especially with the whole Russian interference with the election.
Me too! These kids in this house are driving me crazy.  They need to get back on a schedule.
I think mine have two weeks left.
Did you have a flashlight?
Oh no. Ive only been once but it was great. What happened?
That terrible. Were you able to get a refund?
How old is she?
Why not send her to summer camp?
What was it about?
What did you spend it on?
What movie was it?
I have never seen it.
That would be scary! Can you imagine what the dmv is like? 
That would be an amazing neighbor! I would be so worried!
That is great. Everyone should be loyal to their spouse.
Maybe you can renew your vows one day.
He must of been crazy.
Yes id he do it for money?
Good luck with that. Do you found yourself confortable in your new job?
Holy moly that mustve been a very depressing sight. Did the police end up finding the culprit?
I do hope nothing of value was stolen. I would be frantic if someone stole my family heirlooms.
The visit would be the best gift ever and the paint job a huge bonus.
How far did they have to travel?
What job are you going to get?
What did you use to do for work?
I think he annoys most people.
His tweets are rude and ill informed and he never apologizes for anything.
I bet you were starving! Did they say why they were so late? 
Did you get it free? I would be so annoyed!
Aw man Ive been there before. Has anyone tried using it?
That really sucks. Fortunate to hear that no one misused it though. They are typically pretty fast at sending you a new one.
Wow that sounds unique. What exactly do you sell?
Oh! Well duh silly me. I thought it was food or something. Do you sell other things too?
Did you call the police?
They will find who did it.
Is he unable to take care of himself now?
How caring of you.
That sucks did you still have fun?
What did you bowl?
She annoys me as well! She seemed pretty fraudulent in the last election.
Yes especially for all those emails they found on her private server. Despicable.
That is awesome! What subject was it in?
I sure hope that you did. Statistics is tough!
I hear that my friend. It aint exactly easy living with mine but ya gotta do it for love.
It has to be enough  thats the whole reason why we seek out a soulmate. I do hope things get better.
I love card games also.
Yes I have won a few poker tournaments.
Oh man why are you even still sending him money?
Ahhh so youre upset at your past self? We all make mistakes man its good. What we think is good for us sometimes turns out to not be but hindsight is twenty twenty.
So much for them being up front for you. Man 300 for what thats a lot.
Yea construction zones are crazy so often nooones there!
That would be exciting! What do you plan to do with your winnings? 
That could lead to a gambling problem! I always run away with my winnings.
Yes I hate that so much. The sound of screeching and crushing metal is traumatizing.
Unfortunately yes. I had to get a few staples in my head but my car was totaled...
Smart move  its always a swell idea to get ahead of work so that we can do the things we want to do in life.
Yup I used to procrastinate all the time but I think I am getting better at doing things ahead of time. And it feels so much better to get trivial things out of the way.
Aw man that has to be rough. Were you guys really close?
Thats even more saddening. Did you get to say somewhat of a goodbye to him at their funeral?
Did you return the socks?
That is mean.
Me too but it is still one more month of heat coming but it also means September is on the way.
Why do you say that?
I dont like 100 degree days myself!
I like driving closer to the ground.
I could sure but I will be starting over on payments I might look into it.
At the time it was a change and I like the ride of it but I did not realize I would miss the sedan as much as I did.
What do you have against the ole waterbug?
That is terrifying indeed! I hoped you swatted that beast with the biggest fly swatter available.
Congratulations. Are you excited?
Youll do fine. I look at new things as adventures. 
That would be depressing did you plan it yourself or did someone plan it for you?
Maybe if you post to social media a bunch of random strangers will show up.
Ouch was it an unfair test or did he not study?
Yea hope he can make it up the rest of the year.
Ewww throw that away ASAP.
Throw it in your neighbors trash can. Im sure they would understand?
What a nice gesture! What did you get to eat after not eating for so long?
What kind of toppings did it have on it?
Oh no! What was it?
Yikes! I hope you didnt have any car damage.
I hate it when people laugh at me its so humiliating!
Oh god thats the worst part. The shame afterwards....
Yea man thats good karma!
Me too. Its always the worst when you are trying to get into the carpool line.
Thats awesome. I hope ro retire one day.
What are you going to do now?
What diet do you want to do?
Make sure you drink water also.
I have never heard of an EDM what is that?
Lol sounds like fun! Nothing better than nice hippies!
What does a caregiver do?
Oh I see. Your mom is an angel!
What happened to him?
So sorry to hear that.  I hope that the pain fades with time.
Oh what a disapointment well you can keep saving does it hurts too much?
Oh ok i get it well you just will have to save longer thanks God its painless!
I am sorry to hear that.
I hope you had fun with her.
Same I need someone else to watch horror movies with me.
Hahaha you are very adamant I see.
That is so sweet. I want a puppy. and a boyfriend.
Why did you break up?
oh I do too they must have been having a bad day
yeah I guess so what did they do to you?
Oh lord you might make me vomit right now!
You totally arent sorry. You are being super gross! lol. TMI
That sucks. Ive been nearly broke too several times but thank god for family right?
What happened if you dont mind me asking?
They are really nice cars! Have you driven one?
They are nice looking cars and I have heard are great to off road in!
Thats not cool. Did you put your name on it?
Im so sorry that happened to you better luck next time.
Oh no. Why do you think that happened? 
Maybe you should slow down and only drink a bit at a time. 
I feel you on that man. I get nostalgic all the time. What do you miss the most?
Haha yea no one ever tells you how bad it really is. We get charged for every little thing.
When I was younger but yes
Was she okay? Couldnt have been that bad
Yeah I hate that. Sometimes people will leave their carts right in the middle blocking everyone while they walk off grabbing what they need. So annoying.
I guess they have never heard of a personal bubble.
I am not someone who likes that but I
Im sorry it submitted early. But Id love to hear why it excites you?
true! Thank you It is very real
Ouch did it make you late to work?
Thats great to know there are still good people in this world.
I bet! Could you see yourself walking around?
I bet that brought back a lot of memories! 
Why? Are you from New York?
Nice do you play football too?
What kind of gamer?
I love video games. 
That was very mean of him.
That is great! Always nice to see a good dad for once
Can you give me an example?
Whats the Braves?
Okay cool Im not that big into sports. 
They must of been so proud.
Who gave them to you?
Who got them for you?
Are you quitting your job?
That will be a nice change of pace! Do you have plans for retirement? 
I hate that too. Have you ever noticed thats what they do in movies?
I have seen them leave whole foods in movies. gross
I wish there would be but I very much doubt that there will.
I do to but there are so many unhappy people in the world and they seem to think they have to make everyone else around them unhappy.
Oh nice I dont really watch football.
I havent really watched it on TV but my family watches it sometimes.
Did you fix it?
How many hours did you put into it.
I sadly have no musical skill.  Do you think you will ever become a musician?
What part of being a musician appeals to you?
Life can be tough sometimes. It almost seems like you spend more time preparing for the unexpected than living life in the present. Its cruel sometimes
Its always good to have happiness even in times of worry and panic. So Im glad you still have some optimism!
Wow! Did you report him to the police?
Sounds like that person has boundary issues. My exs brother did that bother and I quickly nipped that behavior in the bud. Good on you for stopping that. Is he in too drugs or something or just entitled?
Omg. I was devastated I grew up listening to him.
I loved his song Starfish  Coffee when I was little.
What can you win?
How much is a ticket?
It was really sad. He was a really good artist.
That would be awesome. I bet it was a really great concert.
Why did he not graduate?
Did he go to college?
Oh no well Im sure youll do okay if you just prepare really thoroughly. 
I hope so too good luck!
Thats a bummer. Maybe you can take it to a repair shop.
Im sure they can figure something out. They might be able to remove the harddrive to recover the photos.
Oh my god! Have you posted everywhere and checked shelters?
Oh no! Did she have a microchip?
That must be so frustrating.
Yes it is. I would be furious!
Im very sorry to hear that. hopefully it will get better with time.
Im sure she is in a better place. Looking down on you.
I hope you do well. What do you think?
Does the job come with more pay?
Good luck to you!
Do you ever try to call the police?
Well do you try to catch them lol? Thats insane We have a dog poop problem at my apartments
I would just throw the bottles back at them
Oh yes I bet the bosses love them too right? That happens a lot. Very unfair
Oh geez work on your side hustle and get out of there. I did a long time ago. Hate those jobs!
You are very lucky. I have 4 children and I have been lucky also to have healthy children.
I know what you mean. I am always so sad when I see all of these sick children on tv.
I would be so happy if they could find a cure for cancer.
Wow. Can she handle all of that?
Thats awesome. She will do great in college.
That sounds awesome!
Im glad that worked out for you it could have gone in a completely different way.
Yay you! I hope your next project turns out just as good.
Oh no that is so sad to hear! I have one dog and two cats so I totally understand what you are going through...
Aww what a cute name. Hopefully you an your Mom made up and maybe you gotcan get another pet.
Oh no! I know it stinks but maybe one day you can forgive her I hope...
Oh no I hope it was for a good reason
Oh man! Its hard when those accidents happen.
Thats great! I hope it goes well for you!
Dang I would have been so upset too. 
It would have sucked more if it was raining. Hopefully you have some good vibes come your way.
I bet. You guys were together for so long. Is this for the best?
Well I am sorry to hear that. If you need anyone to talk to let me know.
was? that almost makes it sound like you didnt graduate or something went wrong did you graduate?
Nope unfortunately not i was hoping to at one point but it never worked out. What did you study? 
medicine andor nursing initially also liked psychiatry but then realised that its history is full of abuse and horror some of which still is ongoing so i didnt want to participate in that. What can one use a business management degree for? Do you literally become a manager in some business or how does that work?
Oh no Im so sorry! They probably already filled the position and it didnt have to do with you personally!
Yeah! People tend to be lazy and not take down the posting once they have filled the position and the automated emails will send a canned response instead. 
Sorry to hear that. Did you have trouble getting the extra precautions?
Well I hope everything turns out okay for you.
Irma last year
How much was it?
Wow thats a lot what type of vehicle?
how many of them were tehre
What color were they ?
Well transportation is very important.  take some old clothing and cut it up if you have to .
Tissue is so expensive its unbelievable
I do as well how long does it take you to do it?
that makes sense but I guess everyone needs food!
Yeah? Who were they playing against?
I think I remember watching it. How old were you then?
Its a boon for everyone. Great life period is childhood.
Yeah whenever I miss my childhood I try to spend the time with the kids. So we can feel better.
I know but now we have another kind of football season coming up soon
Me too I am so excited since the Eagles just won last year!
That happens sometimes. Maybe you should take a break
what kind of food do they serve?
I do too TN but I cant think of a soul food place here.
Its summer vacation. I hope you got enough sleep or it might be a long day for you.
Oh ok I see. Im sure he will want a nap later. Hopefully that gives you time to recharge a little.
Im sorry to hear that. I lost mine recently also.
That must be hard. 
I know what you mean. Its not safe to send your kids out now.
I have to take my kids to parks outside of our neighborhood.
I know that feeling that is no fun but at least they are learning!
That is good that is a nice way to make a bit of extra money!
Im sorry to hear that.  Did you spend a lot of time with her?
Thats terrible.  I hope shes at least at peace now.
I never really got into pokemon.
I tried to do the mobile game but I didnt get it lol
Oh really? How much did you win?
Hey that is nothing to sneeze at I would take that in a heartbeat
Really? Have you got a large family?
But you are all very close knit then?
That must be fun it is so cute watching kids try to read books for some reason
Yeah kids are just so adorable watching them learn in front of your eyes is an awesome privelege 
Thats awesome. What was your major.
Youll do great. Your parents must really b proud.
Oh no. That may ruin the walls.
Hopefully she learns her lesson. 
What is it called? I may tune in!
Oh I have hulu I need to look into that!
What is you job now?
Oh. Well keep looking. You will find something soon.
That is really scary. Hydroplaning is something you can really do nothing about
It happens really quickly. You forget everything then.
Oh youre starting up again soon too? Me too. Im excited and a little bit unexcited. Will be good to have a schedule but worried about being able to do school and earn money to pay rent. What are you majoring in?
Hey thats pretty cool! Im majoring in social work. Those both are close alternatives to social work that I gave some thought to. Sometimes I think I should have done criminology but oh well. I hope you enjoy your semester.
have you grown out of it ?
well thats a good start
That is obnoxious I would switch just to stick it to them
that is terrible that is not a good way to keep people
Glad for you. I have broken up with mine after 3 years of being together
It was her who initiated the first move for us to split our ways. She said she was not feeling happy with me
I would be more than jealous but maybe I am not super sane about that kind of thing
That is probably true but the stories we hear do not help
Im sorry to hear that. Did she pass away recently?
Yeah. It is difficult when you lose someone youre close to.
that is a perfect time to go that is when I went as well
It sure did it was the best vacation I have ever been on
Was he just playing tricks on you to get you to laugh? Or was he being malicious about it? 
Yeah sometimes dads forget how young kids are and just do what they think is funny. My dad wasnt the best either at understanding how fragile kids can be. But he was still a good da
That is scary I was in that position before I do not know why they make it so difficult
Still school is about making mistakes and learning from them
Nothing wrong with that its the unknown that scares us all.
Id try not to be too down on myself over it.
My daughters started back to school today.
Its good but Im a little nervous for them. I know theyll be fine.
i agree on all terms without family we dont mean much in the world
That is not cool I would cancel immediately
Oh yeah you should definitely cancel in that case
Thats lucky!  Did he get hurt from his shoes breaking mid game?
Oh no!  I hope it didnt effect his team too much.
that is pretty normal so do i
those days will not ever come again we have to live with it
who are we talking about?
Oh I am sorry to hear that!
That is no fun leave the kids at home for stuff like that!
Yeah  is it a reboot of the old version from years ago?
Oh cool  I havent played all of them but did playthe first one.
Im not familiar with that tell me more.
That sounds like fun which game platform?
That is awesome I am very much the opposite hat is a great skill!
Wow those are not easy to learn either good job raising them!
oh what happened?
oh thats bad. I feel sorry for you.
Small things like what?
Ah well for some people that is a very big thing!
that sure is a lot of savings
did you check ebay ? its cheaper tehre
How small is small?
Thats not bad. I want a 75 inch but Im settling at 55 for now lol
Oh well i hope the tides turn for you soon!
when is the release date
just in time for the holidays nintendo is smart
Congrats! I bet that feels great!
oh tell him not to feel nervous. He worked very hard indeed.
Oh thats great! good for you him!
Oh no what happened?
Thats not good. Maybe they are trying to protect them better but havent figured out a good plan
Wow that is not cool why not tell your parents?
Ah okay well that makes a big difference
i am excited for you
will you be playing it a lot ?
that is great that is a dream come true for a lot of people!
I understand that it can leave a large void my mom used to be like that too
It can be hard. I went through that myself.
We have to deal with it and try to move on. 
How good. I think you like it a lot
to me likewise I find it a super fun game
thats what the love and family bond i think
accepting .. but not in my case.. you are lucky i guess
Notified of what?
Ah that makes sense
Thats always a bad thing about having to work with others.  What kind of issues do they have?
The worst kind.  I bet they think they know what they need to do and get really annoyed when you try to help.
I am sorry? I do not understand
no iam here dude
yeah me tooo. then how was your day today?
Okay Im feeling nostalgic about my childhood.
it was a long time ago but I still remember it well.
ok thank you bye
Friends help us in difficult times thank God we have them
I hope you overcome that situation with the help of your friends
That really sucks... did you tell them how that made you feel? 
I would tell them.. and if it happens a 2nd time then they arent very good friends to have! 
Oh wow! Thats great. Did she say how it went?
Hired the same day though...she must have done really well despite being nervous!
Sounds like hard work has been paying off for you.
That is always a good feeling. I love when I am on top of things.
I bet that warmed your heart. My old friends wont even drive across the city for me. We always meet downtown.
I went through that for like 5 years.  Ended up finally going and theyve made a lot of advances in comfort since I last went before that.
Yeah you should definitely bite the bullet metaphorically.  Itll only get worse from here if you dont do anything and it probably wont be as bad as you worry.
Thats great! How many do you have?
Wonderful! What kind of instruments do they play?
Are you better now?
Thats so nice to have someone to depend on.
That is so annoying. Do you check the bag before arriving home at least?
Its the worst. I would complain to management. You cant be the only one it happens to.
I hope so too! Waiting for the call back is so nerver wrecking.
Take your mind off of it and before you know it youll be filling out new hire paperwork!
The strength remains us the prayer it helps us to get ahead
Well ... God is in the hands of your doctors
Are you going to go out alone or with the family? vacation?
Well I hope you have a lot of fun in contact with nature
Oh my god. That is horrifying.
I rescue animals its best not to let cats wander outside. So many bad things could happen.
yes! That can happen around any bigger dog. We had a foster dog do it. It is horrible! So sorry for your loss. I have lost many this past year. Accidents happen. 
You are not! I let my cats outside but supervised. Yes its hard if they love it. You can get a special cat fence  
I can understand that. Was there a reason one color was chosen for her and another for you?
Sounds like you wanted to be the same as your cousin and not set apart. It may seem trivial now but I know it wasnt trivial to you at the time.
It must be hard being apart. Just know he will return a better person most likely.
He will need your support when he gets back. Just stay strong and know its for the best.
Wonderful! Congratulations! What are you going in too college for?
You sure can! Hard work is required to get something of value.
 I am so sorry to hear that... how old was she? 
She lived a long life for a cat but its never long enough for us who they leave behind. I hope you feel better soon... 
It really is bad everywhere and the bullying policies dont help. 
Yes it is. It makes me want to homeschool.
Wow! had she ever won before?
Sometimes those things happen just when we need them. It would be nice if they happened for extra money too! lol
You definitely can! What are your plans?
Thats true. I wish you the best of luck!
I congratulate you on your children .... That says a lot about you as a father o mother
We need good parents that will make the world more human
Mistakes happen but its good you are learning from it. We all make mistakes
Maybe it will be just what you need though. Time to really concentrate and learn and grow within yourself as an individual  Maybe you will have a nice romance too
That is very kind of you. You should take it to the vet for a check up.
I takes a special kind of person to do what you are doing. Im sure that dog is already much happier in your care. 
Oh no... yikes have you told your friend yet? 
well thats good of you! too bad it happened  but glad shes not upset 
Thats nice to hear! Whats going on?
Wow. Those are 2 fantastic news!
Sounds like you have a wonderful family. Some people take it for granted.
Ive had those experiences as well. My family is also very precious to me. 
The weirdest thing... it sucks when you dont know whats causing it. Has she been to an eye doctor or just a general dr? 
sounds like a good idea i hope her pain goes away asap! 
You can. It will take some persistence. Hows it going so far?
Oh thats like the reverse pregnancy. When the husband gains the weight!
wow! thats so amazing. I bet you are so proud of him
I bet! What a bright young man you raised!
Oh no. Have you made plans on what youre going to do to take care of them?
It sounds like a tough situation. I feel for ya.
Does she live far away from you?
How often do you get to see her?
how interesting. What country she is at now?
I think England is a pretty safe country. That will be so much fun when you go there
Oh man. I am sorry. Your time will come. That is a very hard situation! One of those hard ones in life.
Maybe you should ask your boss? Maybe he is more charasmatic. That happens sometimes. I am sorry. Ive been there!
That is so generous. Sounds like she has found her calling in life.
I hope she is getting the donations she needs to keep doing this.
I agree with that.  That animal is probably very lucky because of you.
It has already taken its first steps towards independence that is something big
is achieved at a steady pace ... it fills us with hope and happiness
Thats a bummer. What do you do there?
Oh nice! Good for you. Maybe go for a run?
Wow. What gripe does your aunt have with your mom?
Those kinds of people usually have the worse selfesteem. 
Woohoo! That is amazing. hope it came with some great benefits.
Hey sometimes thats even better. More financial stability is great.
Must have been really nostalgic. Did you think about going to play on that field again?
Childhood seems to be a great time for most but then we wanted to grow up too fast.
I bet you feel great too.
That is awesome. Congrats!
Im sorry to hear that.  Tooth pain is something awful to have to deal with.  
Going isnt fun but unfortunately its necessary some times. I hope you feel better soon.
you did the right thing... do you foster them or are they yours since kittens? 
really kind of you! 
Oh my god. You shouldnt just get over it it is not right. Betrayal is something no one should do to another.
Wow! Its always nice when life works out well especially if the person deserves it.
That is hard! I am glad she sees her worth and is going to get more education.
Thats some great police workforce your town has. sarcasm
Wow What state is this in?
That is awesome!  What are you going to do?
That is very brave.  I a sure you will do great!
What does? Were you in a car ride with your aunt?
Oh youre an 80s kids hu? What do you feel about the music nowadays?
Is it something that commits you a lot?
ahh ... then you have to support it
That really sucks
I always hate when work gets in the way of having friends. Its always one way or the other.  If its not your schedule its theirs
Cool. Did he thank the little people?
Thats good. Sometimes bosses think they do it all by themselves.
That is great.  you must be so proud
That is really impressive considering summer is really tough to learn that!
Great are you taking anyone with you?
That should be a very fun trip for you.
Oh god. How big was it?
Man thats scary. Is it out now?
What?! You should ask them for a free upgrade because thats not cool.
Thats awful. Try asking for the manager next time. 
Getting away is definitely needed sometimes.
Are you vacationing somewhere nearby or somewhere else?
That is disappointing.  What kind of laptop is it?
I know how that is.  Good luck with your search!
I know. Sometimes its hard to have some left over after bills. What are you saving for?
Yea it is a lot of expenses people dont prepare for soemtimes.
Why did you leave?
Its rare to find a place where everyone gets along. I hope your new job is still nice?
Yea but I try not to compare. Itll just make me feel bad. What about you?
Wow. How does one get a new car every month. Must be loaded.
Thats great.  True freedom!
I will get there one day.
Is it a well paying one?
stabilize things first then save regularly.
Thats awesome. You must feel really relieved.
Do you tend to have a lot of work?
Woo hoo! Thats awesome. Losing weight can be so hard!
Thats the way to do it! keto has helped me a lot. Yes a lifestyle change versus a diet.
Wow go mom! Is she always such a sweetheart?
I hope you guys let her know how appreciated she is!
Yikes! What did he do to deserve that kind of punishment?
Oh man! Youre right for punishing him. Theft is very bad!
Thats great!  Ive been meaning to but havent had the time.
Have you lost any weight over ht epast month?
WOW! I just found one dog and I thought that is rough. Are you fostering them now?
Wonderful! Rescues will help you with contracts and getting them fixed if you need help. Fix those babies up  Thanks for keeping them safe!
She sounds like a wonderful person. People who try to help defenseless animals are really special.
She sounds wonderful. Id definitely want to be friends with someone like that.
That is hilarious! Was it embarrassing or funny at the time?
I can understand that
Thats great. Sometimes coworkers can be hit or miss. When you get good ones its awesome.
Is that something your work arranges?
Have you tried rewarding him when he does?
It is great to have more time with the kids.
MY first work from home was stressful I had to send the kids to daycare. Not anymore!
Uhoh.  Was it work appropriate?
Oh no.  When will you have to talk to your boss?
Wow. I bet he is tired all the time. I drink coffee all day for energy
Yeah its very important to finish school so you dont have to work three jobs just to survive.
Oh no! Thats so sad.
I dont think they know where theyre going. Probably just trying to get home.
Oh I used to love babysitting... depending on the child haha. How do you feel about it?
I understand where youre coming from. I would probably feel the same way in your shoes.
Oh? Whats your new gig?
That does sound pretty good. I mean working from home is great but doing it on your own time is way better.
Lol. Thats funny. Better hope you dont end up on YouTube.
You will be the talk of the break room.
Being single isnt all that bad. Are you looking for someone?
Better to be single than be with weirdos.
How can you tell if a cactus is dead?
Ive never seen that before
thats very kind. Many people wouldnt go out of their way to do that.
We need more people like you. The world would be a better place.
That sounds like a good lunch! I love Taco Bell
That is definitely good I am not that fortunate! 
Thats pretty nice of you. Has she had any interviews?
I know the feeling. It can be hard getting back out there.
Why? What do they do?
People can be so lazy and inconsiderate of others.
That will be sad. Are you going to get to go again before then?
Take lots of pictures so you can remember it!
Mustve been a really difficult exam. Will there be other exams to balance it out?
I guess the teacher wasnt going to listen to you? That sucks.
That sounds great! Any particular cuisine in mind?
Oh I love those. They always have great selections and the desserts arent bad either.
I hope it goes well!
try to get some rest beforehand.
Woah did she say she was coming back? Shes awfully trusting.
Totally and I bet most people would walk off with it. I have no faith in humanity.
Are you the parent or the teacher? I get nervous meeting anyone new
I felt like that when my kids were younger. Doesnt feel like that now theyre teenagers. Itll be ok just act natural
That was nice. IDid they have to start it over?
Did she hurt herself?
Thats great to hear. Whats going on?
That sounds really great. Happy for ya.
Wow. Thats a great accomplishment. I hope to buy a house soon.
I dont stretch myself too thin. I know Im far from rich.
Oh no that sucks. What happened at court?
Jesus. Thats terrible. I hope you get a breather from that.
That was so nice of them to do such a thing.
I bet it is. When things like that happen it makes you really value where you work. Makes it enjoyable.
Do you guys not get together often anymore?
You all can still spend time together separately even if you cant all be together. Have to make it work.
Thats great to hear! If you dont mind me asking what happened?
Still thats still great. You better knock on some wood though just in case. Dont jinx it!
I know the feeling. At least you made it.
Three hours though. I dont think I wouldve made it.
Oh no. what happened?
If only people were more considerate of others. Its not just them in the world.
Are they grown up now? They grow up so fast.
hahaha I bet there are.
Cool. Ive never been camping.
I would be afraid of animals and bugs I think.
That happens sometimes. Maybe next year.
I took my kids to the beach and now every time we leave the house they ask if thats where we are going. 
Well its 9 hours away so we probably wont go until next year either lol
Did you get lucky and some kind person turn it in
That is horrible. Just think it could have been worse. You could have wrecked and totaled a car or a house burnt. Lots of things are worse.
Glad for you. A girl I know was walking to her house and a car hit her and killed her. So its just money and can be replaced
Yes we are here for just a short time
OMG. I would have been so scared.
Did it get away or bite you?
Well youre popular then at least.
that actually makes sense to me.
Did you notice any funny glances from anyone?
Did you taste anything funny from the lipstick?
That sounds great! Did you just get out of a rough relationship?
Oh gosh Im sorry to hear that. Hang in there theres a lot of great guys out there.
probably time to get the traps and get rid of it.
going to have to do something...call somebody to help you.
That happens sometimes. Is it like that this time of year?
will it pick up soon?
Why have you been lazy?
What kind of work is it?
Oh nice! Are you taking any cool classes?
How exciting! The first day of school is always so fun. 
Hope they dont find out.  Were you just tired or something else?
Well next time try telling her the truth like  I am too tired right now can we do it another day. and that way you wont feel bad.
Im sure she would understand if she is a good friend.
I bet it will be a good dinner since there is some guilt involved. lol
Thats true. Im glad I live in an apartment.
Lol. I think thats more hard work but youd only have to do it once lol
Whats the modelmake
Dang that is a pretty slick ride...how close are you to buying one
I really hate that!
Some people are so petty.
Does that still happen? I can relate...it was a relief to go on vacation and get away from them.
Thats great. I went to Europe for a while and came back to the more of the same stomping around above my head. It was a dream to get away.
Wow. Thats exciting!
Its not that bad. Ill get to Europe one day lol
I dread that it will go so quickly!
What do you do during the day?
What were you standing on? Just the ground?
Are those by Kanye West? Not hip with the lingo.
I have heard water is expensive in California. Well  they are worth it if you can jump straight up five or six feet.
I might be able to do that not sure.
Oof that sucks. Sorry about that. I dont like cutting my grass so my front door is covered in pink papers from city citations. oof
Nothing like redneck engineering. Did you use Flex tape.
Oh darn I really like those infomercials wanted to know how the stuff worked.
Actually it costs 15 dollars where Im located.
you like it a lot now what does it do?
of Mike Tyson
I hate when that happens and they tell you to come early too.
Seems fair they dont value your time it seems like.
It is always nice to be able to rely on friends when you need them most.
I hope the party turned out to be a great success because of his help.
Oh no I couldnt imagine! Im so sorry!
Yeah and how easy life was? i wish we could atleast have 1 day a year like that but to actually feel as free as them! 
Idk ourselves maybe? lol D
Do you mind talking about it specifically?
haha well thats a pleasant surprise...what kind of car
That is such a beautiful memory to have. I love that we forever have moments like this... How cool Hong Kong! 
I do actually quite a few mainly old country songs like daddys hands is a big one super oldie!  
Do you have a past traumatic experience?
Sorry to hear that.  Im positive youll be smart about your lifestyle choices though
Some things like that you wont ever forget thats pretty rad 
you should do it again just for the heck of it 
Sometimes I feel the same as you ... but I get up and move on
Thats right ... I wish I could do that ... disconnect
Did you stub your toe?
Oh no! Thats even worse! Did you puke a little? I wouldve thrown up!
What did he say? 
Always good to trust your spouse but I would be on the fence a bit and have my eye out too. 
That is pretty bad situation he is in. I feel little mad myself too.
Yeah i would say the same to him too man.
When did you start getting better
Thats pretty cool
How old is he? I really hope its nothing serious  
wow that really is TOO young! Lets hope its nothing serious. He will get thru it regardless. 
What is it?
I can tell! Are you doing anything special for it?
Are you going to be okay
I am glad you are okay
That doesnt seem fair I  hope they changed their ways eventually.
Thats unfortunate I wonder if hes forgiven them?
thats so sweet i bet she is how old is she? 
omg i cant wait to see what that feels like as a parent congrats! 
Oh no please tell me whats going on! Can I help?
Thats the worst Im sure it was an annoyance!
Nice I can relate.  How old were you when you moved out
Thats cool. I was 17 when I first moved out.  Now Im 26 fully selfemployed and hang out with whoever I want to.  But I had to have a lot of faith in myself
That is pretty great! I like it when you can wake up and not care about stuff.
That is pretty awesome! I wish i could do stuff like that.
Did he get it for you for a specific reason or just because?
Thats so kind of him! What a dad!
I am sure you will love it
I am sure you will good luck
Why do you feel bad about yourself?  I am sure whatever it is cant be that horrible.
Even if you feel you voted for the wrong person you shouldnt worry.  You will be able to vote for a new person in a couple years!
Good luck! I have faith on you.
I am sure you are going to excell
I love that as well!  Nothing better than unexpected cash!  Has this happened to you recently?
Awesome!  Congrats to you on that unexpected windfall!
I think you should get out and explore.  Im in a similar situationmoved to South Texas with zero connectionsfamily to jumpstart my business...and Ive met some pretty amazing people
You definitely will trust me
That happen to me frequently. Did your manager said anything because you are late?
It can be annoying
I am sorry to hear that.  How long has he been promising you the promotion?
I can imaging.  He sounds pretty spineless and shady.
Why did they do tha
I am sorry that happened to you
Family is very important.
The same for me i try to keep them close.
Why do you think that?
What will be her major?
Do you? You should trust her thats what marriage is about!
Thats awful Im sorry.
I am really sorry.Do you have house insurance?
Do you have a place to stay for a while?
Yes...but in what context
Nice thats pretty smart...always go with your instincts
Yeah....But his daughter is doing pretty well at least almost ending up like him.
Well she is still pretty young and learning to handle animals probably be like her father sooner or later.
Well thatt not your fault at all. Its your scumbag significant others fault. You shouldnt feel ashamed for the crummy thing he did  you did nothing wrong.
If hes not meeting your standard then its time to find a new boyfriend  even if thats the hard thing to do. You shouldnt ever lower your standards.
Oh my gosh no are you feeling okay?
Are you taking medicine for that? Do you have heartburn or do you feel gluttonous?
I would love that too
That wont be too hard
Sorry to hear that. Is he better now?
Did the doctors have found what was the issue with his heart?
Thats pretty cool. What flavor do you think you are going to get?
Berry sounds like it would be very tasty.
Whoa did anything bad happen? 
Im glad nothing bad happen snake venom can really mess you up...
How did you feel about that
I know the feeling.  Just broke up with my exgf 5 months ago.  But heshe is out there chin up 
Wow good luck Im a big fan of watching MMA myself.
Oh oops my fault for assuming. Definitely an intense experience either way as you said.
Ugh I did the same thing today! Im going to have to start making fresh cups in the morning and afternoon.
Cant go wrong with a spittoon. And it makes a nice conversation piece when you have visitors over.
Thats awesome! Was it your birthday?
Your friends care a lot of you and thats always a great feeling! I hope you had fun!
Oh no are you okay
I hate being that drunk
Dang thats kinda hurtful. Why did you miss the wedding?
Ive had those days before. I would just take it as a lesson and try to control your drinking next time when important events are in the near future.
How long did it take to prepare for?
Aw sorry about that! Did you have a pet you could take there with you?
Yeah I have a dog and I take it to the park sometimes. It can help you feel less lonely for sure.
Dang thats quite a large amount of money to lose. Hopefully it went to someone who needs it.
That would be nice. Maybe hell go and buy some candy from the candy store.
I try not to have any friends.
I advice not to trust anyone ever. Stay to yourself and be sad my friend.
I do not want to be the first one.
Well that isnt really pleasant i bet.
Well hope you didnt have flashbacks of it too often.
Best of luck! Have you won in the past?
Wow youre pretty lucky...I can never win those things
Are you a mother? It could be a maternal thinginstinct.
Oh well you could still have protective traits as a male. How old is your cousin?
Thats nice of your dad  its sometimes hard to get a car on your own. What kind of truck is it?
Nissans are top of the line. I hope you get a lot of use out of it.
What is the trick
That is a good dog then
Aw that sucks. Everyone gets old eventually how old is shehe?
Thats good to hear I hope he feels and gets better
I think those people dont actually eat that much it just seems like it though.
If hes tallerbigger than you it would make sense if he doesnt gain any weight
That seems like a lot of pizza rolls how do you feel?
Hey we all pig out at some point
Thats too bad. Its nice to have friends to revel in our victories. Why dont you get yourself a beer and relax on the porch?
If you need someone to join in just let me know!
I am sorry to hear that.  Any certain areas you think you could have done better on?
Dont be so hard on yourself.  Most people cant even spell physics.
Oh no what happened
I am sorry I hope you find it
Thats so sad to hear! How did she pass? If you dont mind me asking.
Thats terrible my friend. How are you holding up?
I love it when it rains.
Sunny days are very hot and i do not like that.
Nice I usually forget a thing or two. Did you get everything you needed?
I assume you were very prepared!
What techniques have you learned so far though?
I think you will do pretty well then in a street fight.
Thats pretty cool.  Grew up with the Gameboy Color and Gameboy Advance myself
Wow that sucks. Did you try calling the grocery store?
Your neighbor is a good person. I would have...given it back to you haha.
I have a pesky sneaky little dog like that too! Did you clean it up?
Thats good. Was she guilty when she saw you cleaning it up?
That is disgusting my dog does that too but in sneaky places. Its always a surprise lol
Yeah our dogs need to be punished and maybe trained more.
Oh wow. Maybe they were busy doing other things? Did you find anyone else to play with?
Sometimes playing by ourselves is how we get better.
What kind of job
I am sorry that happened
Six Flags is such a fun park! Are you a fan of roller coasters?
They are! Cedar Point has some gnarly roller coasters too.
I love that too! Isnt it great!
What are you planning on doing with your vacation time?
What happened that day?
Did any of you get hurt?
Wow thats unfortunate. People dont realize that can happen but it happened to my friend when we were little.
Sorry to hear that recovering from any pet lose is hard.
Did you get attacked by a big dog when you were little?
Maybe it was because you saw your brother get attacked by one and you are scared it might happen to you.
Did you try to go to the grocery store to give it back?
Sorry to hear that. How did she pass?
Man very sorry to hear that. First your mom now your aunt. Sounds like you have very unfortunate relatives.
I do love to read as well
That sounds so nice
Holy moly! Sounds like you are eating well tonight!
Well Im sure you can find a recipe online that uses spent lottery tickets.
Are you homeless?
Lol I bet that a good looking sandwich then.
Oh you will probably be just fine dont worry about it too much.
Dentist arent people focused on trying to hurt you.
Ut oh.. What did you eat?
Dont worry... you only live once!
I hate driving I avoid it as much as possible. 
Mine was from being in one and just being nervous about having to be in charge of things.
Thats good to hear. Why do you thank god for her?
Well thats nice. I thank god for my wife as well
Well there are always bigger fish in the sea trust me.
That is also very important to learn.
That sucks do you feel better now?
Yeah isolation can happen when you get super sad. At least you are feeling better now
Thats always a positive in my book what kind of food was it?  What were your reservations about the restaurant before going?
Is it in a bad part of town or is the building just bad luck or run down?
I am sorry that sounds bad
Maybe it wont happen again
Oh my gosh!  That must have been so embarrassing!
Dont worry.  Im sure you will never make that mistake again!
Aw that sucks because money was the issue. Maybe she can take a bus or something?
Yay! I love happy endings
Oh how scary! What happened?
I am so sorry you had to see that. That is so bad. Did you have to call it in?
Ouch! that stinks man why she do it?
That is even worse Like why would someone just do that when commited to someone.
Parties are some times very loud.
If my friends did that I would have a heart attack.
What movie are you referring too?
Oh! Well i havent seen that yet. was the action at least somewhat decent?
Yeah I hate waiting for the results of a long term goal
Damn you suck at soccer. Just kidding good job!! lol
Oh no.. what happened?  Are you ok?
What did you lie to him about?
I am sorry he will stop eventually
He will get better
Wow why does he need to drink so much?
Im sorry Ive dealt with something like that before and it can be very anger inducing.
Did you do anything wrong?
Oh.. thats horrible.  I am so sorry.
Myself as well friends are what make life better.
Alone time is important but you will go crazy if you are always alone.
Was it a smartphone? Maybe you can track it ?
Aw that sucks. Did you get a new phone?
He is a terrible person! Did he even know it was your cat? What took so long...
I hope you feel better
What kind of cars do you like the best?
Range Rovers are my favorite too. If you work hard you can get one!
When did she pass away?
Well have you been living a happy life? She would probably be happy about that.
I am sure she is happy too
It can be hard but its possible
Do you have cameras?
I know right? Its even more worse when its hot outside and it cooks to your car so its harder to clean up
Have you seen any recently? It is really sad what gets me the most is hearing about black bears being hit.
Poor thing its not fair! Drivers need to watch out!
Well hopefully the car didnt get damaged.
Well i would just be happy nothing too bad happened at least.
Thats frightening. Was it dark outsside?
Thats even worse. I hate being lost in general
Oh man that stinks. What did you do in response?
Did he ever apologize?
Ive never had a party like that myself.
No one really likes me enough to do that for me.
What journey?  Do tell.
Oh Congratulations...  That is a huge accomplishment!
oof that is a long healing process after the surgery.
That is tough i bet. I hope he heals well.
Thats awesome! Did you guys do anything?
Nice! I hope you guys did a lot of catching up!
Wow! What a jerk for him to up and leave with no way to contact him. Was it a lot of money?
Im so sorry you should see if you can find him on social media!
Who was following you?!
What did he look like? I would call the cops if they are stalking you.
Oh man! Does it still work??
I would have sat there playing for hours.
Oh snap! dude get your camera you might have found nessy.
Probably could be a new species of gator.
I know how that goes.  It can be hard to stay on track at the end of the semester.
Congratulations!  Studying really pays off!
Jeeze I thought that only happened to me. Doesnt it just suck? I dont blame you for not picking it up I can imagine how gross it mustve been
Its okay most people would do that and not even care so the fact that you even have the trashman in your mind shows that youre a good person.
Yeah been there done that. You want to comfort them but you dont know what to dosay
I hope he feels better and you could be there for him too!
Oh poor lady. I know how it is though. Sometimes our initial reaction is to laugh even when not appropriate.
At least you recognize that it may not have been appropriate. 
I can imagine. Was she a hoarder of some type?
Did you see anything interesting?
Did you tip him well for doing such a good job?
It is not often that you get good service at a restaurant.
I enjoy doing that after a hard day at work as well.  I hope it relaxes you!
Now I am in the mood for Netflix!  Enjoy the new series now that you are relaxed!
Did you punch him in the nose?
This is why i got rid of all of my friends.
Ah  thats a big accomplishment!!!  Did you get her a great present?
HAHA!  That is the best tradition Ive ever heard of!
Oh man I know the nerves can be rough but Im sure youre excited as well. But yea throwing yourself into a group of new people can be rough.
Oh wow. Well I really hope you enjoy the new job! I have a feeling youll do just fine.
Yes.. I have a test coming up and I should be studying right now!  LOL
They say some of the smartest people are procrastinators.
Did you find anything interesting inside any of the buildings?
Oh man I would have freaked out! What did you do?
That is pretty great! what show is it?
Havent heard of it but since your sons going to be on it i will watch it.
As someone who was once a 19 year old man dont be too shocked.
Yikes hes one of the zombie drunks.   Thats unfortunate.  Drinking might not be for him.
Most do. I know a guy that kind of gets blackout drunk like that.  His brother does too.  Now neither of them drink hard liquor well they havent for ages now
Thats really cool. I know how much my husbands pocket knives mean to him.
Thats really interesting. I know my husband is bad about leaving his laying around and forgetting where they are. When he finds them again it is such a surprise.
What was it?
So everything is okay then? Thats good news!
Oh no Im so sorry to hear that. Are you thinking about getting another one?
Oh I understand. They say time heals all wounds I hope it does in your case as well.
Oh no! Im sorry to hear that. I have been to court before it isnt as scary as it seems.
That wont happen. Even if it does the judge may have a good laugh and cut you some slack.
I am guessing she is not with us anymore?
I know the feeling i had my grandmother gone for 5 years now still miss her.
Did he tell you the reason?
If you live under his roof then you should obey him.
I understand I have trouble waking up early too.
Me too I just have to set a bunch of alarms and try my best.
Were you worried it could be something very serious?
Thats good to hear. Im sure you feel very relieved now.
What was that?
A bunch of toys and stuff?
That is pretty good news! What kind of job is it for?
Everyone needs a IT guy though so probably.
I see people walk out of the bathroom all the time without washing their hands. So gross.
That is really disgusting. I dont think I would ever eat at his house. 
Yeah no doubt!
Im sure you arent the worst in the class dont say that!
Theres always next time you just need to study harder!
That is awful. I hope she has friends and family she can lean on during this tough time.
I wouldnt wish that on my worst enemy.  I feel so bad for her.
Thats unlucky did you ever exchange information?
Well I hope it all works out in the end somehow.
What kind of dog was the costume or did it look weird?
Well were they trying to sell something maybe?
That is so cool.  What kinda stuff does she juggle?
Oh lord. Did the other person die?
Man i would have left and walked out right away.
That has to make you feel so good deep inside.
Wow that is thoughtful.  Thoughtfulness will help him go a long way in life.
Wow! How can someone do that to someone with someone so close?
Thats such a shame. And shame on his brother too!
What did you watch?
So what was it?  You are making me scared.
Oh man that is pretty scary.
You should probably see a priest then.
I hate when that happens.  Makes you want to leave things for the mailman.
I hope they can take it back for you.
Are you baby crazy?  Let me guess.. 30ish?
That sucks. Missed opportunity or biological problems?
Whatever it is you seem excited. What is it?
Vacations are sooooo nice!!!  I hope you have an amazing one!
Thats really annoying for you but I hope everyone involved is okay.
I cannot stand people who do that! Dont they know they could be blocking someone from getting the medical attention they need?
Why are you there all alone?
I hope you arent too lonely!
Oh no. Why did he steal?
Sometimes they have a reason and it doesnt make him a bad person depending on the reason.
That was so nice of her. Im sure that you really appreciated her for doing that.
Maybe you have a budding chef on your hands.
A bit of nostalgia huh?  It is always wonderful to look back on old family memories.
The times we share with family should always be cherished.
Oh no what happened if you dont mind me asking.
Oh man that sucks. You can enjoy the day on your own! Forget them then.
Oh I love surprises like that! How exciting!
I hope not either but its sweet!
You must be thrilled. What did you have?
Is this your first?
Oh no I know that must make you feel bad but you cant always be there.
Thats good. How many girls do you have?
That sucks.  Maybe they can wait just a bit longer for you?
We always need to make time for our families.  They are the most important thing in this world.
Wow. Must be a really good show. Whats it about?
I love thrillers. I watched Killing Eve.
Are you working while you are at work?
Smart man smart man.
Oh no what happened to cause the cheating?
Have you guys talked about it? Or is he still upset?
How many do you have? Are they excited?
What is making you so nervous?
had they been eating too many?
oh thats a cute one.
What will you do if you cant be with your wife all the time?
Oh that makes a lot of sense now then.
Ohhh no!  There was no one there to offer you a towel?
Was it crowded?
Make him Facebook famous. The Viral terrible mail man. 
Send you self a empty package or something.
Wow. Raccoon digging through the trash hu?
Are you usually afraid of raccoons or just surprised?
Was this an unplanned trip?
Well Im sorry that this was sprung upon you but I hope you have a safe trip!
Wow. Thats a pretty low thing to do.
Oh just a nail? You are a nice person.
Wow! What a champ for doing that. You guys owe him!
Get that man a wife!
You must be so relieved that its done. 
They are going to have so much fun with it.
Thats a really adult move on her part.
Shes showing shes responsible. I think shell be just fine growing up.
I wish you the best of luck on your proposal and the possibility of it becoming a reality.
What kind of project may I ask?
I hope you did well and congratulations on Law School!
Law is a pretty tough career. You mustve worked hard and Im sure that will pay off.
Sometimes it is very hard and the jealousy can come out. I hope you have a really strong relationship though.
I have seen many relationships be destroyed because of time and space. Good luck to you all.
Thats so great to hear. Relationships can be hit or miss sometimes. Sounds like you got a good one.
Over 2 decades. Thats a long time.
That sounds cool.  So you are fixing it yourself?
Best of luck with that.  Hopefully you will do fine and save a ton of cash.
Oh no do you at least have food?
Ramen is delicious! I eat them even when Im not worrying about money.
Whoa awesome! Really youve never been? Which one are you going too?
Whoa! Make sure to bring money for food or bring frozen drinks. And lots of sunscreen and comfy shoes!
Im glad you can do what youre passionate about.  What kinds of animals do you rescue?
That sounds so fun.  I hope I can do that some day too!
I can imagine. Take this time to do something for yourself.
There you go. Sounds like fun.
Caught by a train? Do you mean it was late?
hahah I was kind of concerned but didnt want to ask. Glad that is the case then.
How do you cheat a little. Either you cheat or you dont.
what show was it ?
i loved the ed gein documentary 
Oh no thats terrible.  Did you make it up to him?
That is thoughtful!
congratulations. You worked really hard and deserved that pass!
Thats an amazing feat. Studying is kind of a chore for me.
Awww.. what kinda dog is it?
that is so cute.  I had one of those.
Oh were you just tired that day?
lol it happens. Had a good night?
Congratulations on the kid
I am sure she will be fin
I get that so many people in the world are so much worse off then us. I think its easy to forget that.
I wish I could be more like you. 
Oh no! I really hope it goes well for you! That must be so stressful!
Im sorry. That is a really tough situation. Ill be thinking of you and hoping for the best.
Im sure youll be able to do yours soon.  And maybe you can get some good ideas from hers!
And when you do yours it will be that much newer than hers 
I bet you are very eager to find out good luck!
Was the test hard?
Double check your list.  Camping is always wonderful but hard to come back for something you forgot.
Did you make a list?
Me either. I dont want too thoughlol. Are you scared?
Oh man. Well I used to cuddle a dog when I would get scared. Find a dog
Oh nice. What color is it?
Interesting to see how muave works. Thats a shade of purple isnt it?
Oh no. I hope theyre okay. How long until your neighbor gets home?
I hope everything turns out okay.
Man thats horrible luck. Did you forget to lock it or did they just bust in?
Are you kidding me? The nerve of some people. How desperate do you have to be... Well I hope you can at least replace the present so your son isnt too sad. And at least they didnt try to bust into your home and harm you.
Thats pretty lucky did you spend it?
Well if you do choose to spend it make sure you do it wisely!
Lol! The real question is...was the poop fresh or old? I hate that shit no pun intended
Ewww did you clean it off?
I wish I had a expedition
I agree with you there. Lets just finish this one.
I hope they do for you as well. Thank you!
Thats funny. Id tell them the tooth fairy stole it. 
You better come up with something.
Oh man! Will you need a new keyboard now?
Oh dont worry accidents happen!
Yes!!! I hate the city and prefer the rural areas. Are you going to get farm animals?
I agree I love farms because it feels so natural.
At this point all you can do is hope for the best. Hopefully if you worked hard it will turn out good.
Dont stress over it. You cant change anything at this point.
Thats always rough maybe she didnt hear you?
Well she was just rude then. Not your fault at all.
OMG that is wonderful!!!  I bet you are really proud!
You say that but it sure is nice!
Oh wow. Is it raining or something over there?
How long is the work gonna take? I hope you dont get any weird power outages.
That sucks. What did you order?
Yea Mcdonalds can be so hit or miss sometimes.
Well. Maybe youll get a promotion.
Nice! Where did you learn Thai?
Thats impressive. I bet you are more than prepared for this trip then!
Youre moving into the dorms soon hu? Are you excited?
Whats your major?
That is cool! Was it a gift for any certain occasion? 
I bet you were so happy! Thats so awesome!
I am sure it will be worth it in the end
I bet he was proud too
Animal abuse disgusts me. I dont what would drive someone to do that...
If I had a chance to rescue an animal I would totally do it. 
Did you get sunscreen and a waterproof belly bag and a hat?
Oh no! Yes its the number one thing to not forget. I hope you all have fun!
Wow how exciting. I bet it looks like a fat little old man.
I would hit it out of spit now
Must have thought you wanted some of his sweet unemployment check
Thats what Im talking about! That sounds so nice. Im a little jealous. Sounds like you deserve it though.
Thats always nice to hear. Better that then hearing someone else getting the spotlight and recognition just because theyre in a higher position. I hope that keeps happening for you.
He sounds so computersavy.  How will you repay him?
Dinner might be a welcomed surprise.
Me too!! I love summer weather and vibes so much
I know the free time is the best. You can do whatever you want whenever!
OH no. Shame of you!
Just dont do again and Ill keep your secret.
Nice! What is his major?
I am sure you will get it
I do believe you
Whoa whoa whoa that still happens in this day and age? How did they even get away with that?
Well good. I hope they got a lot of negative press. That stuff shouldnt fly these days. 
That is way too much money to blow for sure
I feel bad for the parents then
That is horrible! Were their any cameras?
Oh man. Thats too bad. Still not fair.
Sounds like so much fun.  What did you see?
It must have been really scary movie then.  Try leaving the tv on to help.
That sad. I hope she is okay.
It will be fine. Make sure you spend time with her and let her know that it will be okay. It can be helpful
That sounds delicious! What type of pizza did you order?
Lol! Maybe the rat is the chef? The restaurants secret is a rat in the hat!
Aww thats sad. Do you have a bad relationship or not have one?
That can get really lonely but its good to find yourself so you are really ready when the right one comes along.
I feel you my brother is my roommate and my friend too 
That sucks why did she move out?
I know exactly what you mean. Ive been single 2 years now.
I think Im a little rusty in that department myself.
Why arent you looking forward to it?
Thats unfortunate. A week is a long time.
That sounds like a lot of fun! I mean I havent even really gone anywhere higher than Olive Garden myself so Im jealous. Did you go with anyone special?
Thats really sweet! I bet that was a nice scene. Was it a special occasion or did you guys just want to enjoy yourselves just for the heck of it
Thant sucks. I always use turbo tax. 
Maybethey will let you do a payment plan?
Well I bet youll do better next time. I hate paying extra for anything.
Oh wow! Thats awesome! What will you buy?
Thats a good idea. Its extra money so do what you want!
Thats awesome! How long has it been since youve seen him?
Oh that sucks then. I hope you guys get along and squash beef?
I am sorry that sounds gross
I hate that smell
Nice! Thinking about it...Im 22 and still dont know how to change a tire hahah
I should learn how to do it it seems pretty basic?
Nice tell him congrats. What did he major in?
He should become an English teacher1
How much did you lose
I am sure you will make it
Why would he do that??
What is her name?
Thats cute. I love the cute names people give their pets.
Dont feel guilty. We all slip sometimes.
Ha Ha. Just try to do better next time.
What was the menu?
I bet she loved it!
I hope so too. Im sorry that he is going through that.
A lot of kids these days are addicted to technology. Does she listen to you often?
That sucks. How old is she because if she is young she may grow out of it
Thats great. Sometimes family isnt good with loans.
Was it pretty far down before?
Wow they are still making them? Only ones I enjoyed was MW1 MW2 and BO1.
I actually did buy that one on Steam but it barely has any players 
What is your favorite dish?
Ive heard of that dish before. I need to try it sometime can I come?!
I bet you find someone soon
I have been there too it will get better
Sounds like shes going to be on Master Chef in a couple of years. What did she make?
Thats wise  its irresponsible to let kids meander in the kitchen alone. Too many sharp objects.
Thats sounds promising.
Sometimes people think they dont need to study but it really is helpful even if you think you know the material
Aww thats sweet of her! Youre lucky to have her not all moms are good.
Thats good Im sure she enjoys seeing you happy and taken care of.
Thats pretty sweet of her. Some people would find it annoying that their parents still want to baby them but I say you shouldnt take it for granted. They just want to be in your life.
Well let her know here and there how much you appreciate it. Sometimes we forget that even though we think and feel certain things its not always obvious to the other person. They need some verbal confirmation of appreciation!
Eating vegetables is disgusting to me so I just blend it all in a smoothie. You should try that
Honestly I have no idea. But it beats eating vegetables 1 by 1 because that takes forever
I hate that feeling. Hopefully you will feel better about it tomorrow.
You can always start again tomorrow.
Well at least after the storm there will be some sunshine!
Thats where earmuffs or plugs come in handy my friend
That is horrible luck!  At least you werent hurt.  Some insurance companies cover that as well so you should check.
Hopefully that little mishap doesnt cot you anuthing!
Oooo that sounds fun. Will you visit that giant place where gladiators fought?
Well now I know where I want to visit too. Great idea!
Hey I just saw that trailer! Im kind of excited for it too since I loved him as a kid. But I felt like the trailer had a few dumb lines it even though I love Tom Hardy.
Youre right he was pretty good as Bane. Glad to see someone else is a fan and is looking forward to it.I see it getting a lot of negativity.
I agree I love that feeling. What do you do for work?
Nice I bet it sucks when its blazing hot outside.
Who did you invite?
Where was the party?
October? I thought most Call of Duty games come out in November?
It will be October as soon as you know it trust me. Hopefully they release a beta so we can play it earlier.
I have not seen it yet tell me abnout it
That sounds insane honestly.
Wow.Really? What kind?
Whats your uncles number? lol
Cool. Say hi to your new Auntie! 
Happens a lot to me actually its sometimes enough to make me sad.
Yeah I get like that. I sometimes drive somewhere just to get the feeling I used to have there. Crazy how life goes.
Im sorry you were dissappointed.  It is hard to spend so much money on a dud movie.  Was the popcorn good at least?
Its always good to save money but still it stinks.  They should have to make them good for the prices they charge.
Wow she is a keeper. What car is it?
Congratulations on the strong marriage and car!
I know you will be great in the end.
People do that sometimes and it is really sad.
Why? What happens on Christmas eve for you?
Ohhh duh! I should have seen that coming lol
Thats too bad. Are you thinking about going to court for it?
Yeah thats a load of whack. I hope you win your case and show those pigs whos boss.
Well thats disappointing. Have you been working there longer then your coworker?
I believe in you!!
My friends and family always talk about that show is it good? 
I heard its really graphic and a lot of sex scenes. I will watch it...for educational purposes.
Ive been there
Just imagine if you found a mix tape on an actual cassette
Are you sure it wasnt palying dead?
Eww what the heck! I guess you really were at a bad place at the time.
Im sure you will knock it out of the park. What is it on?
Thats neat  I like economics as well. Why are you so gungho about it?
Oh then dont feel bad? I think the teacher is trying to get everyone else involved.
You can always give them some money once you get yourself back on your feet. Just keep your head up  things will get better.
If I ever meet you I will toss a few bucks your way. We all have to help each other out in this tough world.
Cool! What did you get?
Well good for you!
Investigate that right now! You need to know
I would not do that just get a divorce and take half of all.
wow. I hope you have studied hard so you will do well. 
Well as long as you have studied hard you should do well. Just relax knowing you have prepared yourself. 
Oh my goodness! Did you get hurt?
Thats so sad. Did your house get damaged?
Yeah that bothers me to.  Dont sweat it too much though.  Just consider it their loss and move on.
There are.  The people who ignore you are not worth your time or effort.
You got this bro just be confident. I believe in you
She likes you! If she askstalks about you then you have a much better chance too.
That is so great! Are you in the process of applying now? Im sure you will get in eventually.
Perhaps. Or you just need to keep trying. Dont give up on your dreams so easily!
That sounds interesting is it hard to make?
Did you really just say that hahaha. You are crazy
That sounds like fun. But I dont think Hillbilly is a very nice way to describe people. 
Funny but true. Have you ever been to the races before?
Exciting! Did you get any neat gifts?
Its always good to have friends that know your likes. What is in your collection?
Thats always fun. Did you win any money?
Oh darn. Better luck next time.
That is terrible are you okay?
I feel super bad about that i wish the best for you.
I believe in you man. Im a bit rotund myself but I started hitting the gym this past week.
Yeah! By the end of the year well be lifting Ford F 150s!
For what? Are you a diver or something?
Oh well good luck. Have you heard of Wim Hof? Hes like a world record breath holder and he does it in freezing temperatures too. 
My dog does that too. I think its the loud noises that scare them. 
Lol if only we can understand dogs and listen to what they are saying. That would be hilarious.
Haha. These dogs that Im dogsitting wouldnt let that happen. They wake me up at 630AM every morning to feed them. But hey we make mistakes. Maybe you had a busy day today.
Ah hates a strong word. Theyre smarter than we give them credit for. They know you always feed them. At the end of the day I doubt she could have a much better owner
What is a aardvark?
I thought so. The name alone sounds so exotic were you mad that you had to clean pooop?
You usually dont get that much jail time for drunk driving if it is your first incident. It shouldnt be so bad but hopefully it will make you more cautious in the future.
Oh wow. I really hope that you get the help you need. I can relate though...I used to be reckless like that a couple years back. Just have to be responsible and arrange an uber or some other form of transportation.
Oh I am so sorry to hear that. Did you get her something nice?
That was very thoughtful something to keep her entertained when she wasnt feeling well. Is she doing better?
Thanks for that information.
Thats so nice! Did she like your craftsmanship?
It was still a nice gesture. I would love my children to build be a big ole gazebo.
Nice! Did you manage to snag the promotion?
Its good to work hard for that dough. Whats your new billet entail?
Oh my goodness! I bet that was embarrassing. But it happens. 
eventually they will forget. They will probably do something even more embarrassing then the joke will be on them. haha.
That is nice. What kind of computer did he get?
I wish I had a better computer. Why do they have to cost so much?
How did that experience go?
Im very glad and I understand how the memories are.
I would too.  What had happened?
Yes.  Did they admit fault?
How old are your kids?
Are you worried they are going to be abducted or something?
What can you lose?
You do. I mean it can only go one of two ways. And if it goes one way you can try again with another girl.
Do they have insomnia?
Well they will have insomnia and sore bottoms haha
That happened to me too when I was in elementary school. I lost all my friends and had to make new ones which sucks.
I bet she felt really special!
I can relate to that!
Me too. I miss payments sometimes because I forget about them and Im lazy.
Thats my exact situation too.
Ah so youre in the same boat as me? I can understand how that goes. Electricity is so necessary nowadays too.
Im with you. Sometimes responsibilities get too overwhelming and you feel like you have to hide from them. At some point though Im sure you and I will improve.
Smoking is pretty bad for everyone.
You have to try it could change your life.
I like dogs
How many do you have?
Can you get another job?
Can you take out a loan?
Yankees fan huh? I should pit you against my brother. He loves the Red Sox. I bet you guys would argue for a while.
Haha hed probably say the same thing to you. Hes been a fan of them for about 20 years. What about you? How long have you followed them?
That sucks how old were they?
Wow how old are the kids?
ITs sad but I think so too.
Congratulations. We dont share the same sentiment.
Have you asked him how he feels about that entire situation?
Life is a scary place anything could happen at any time.
Really? Thats one of the saddest things Ive heard in a while. Im sorry to hear that. What happened to your family if you dont mind me asking?
I am terribly sorry to hear that. Youve got to be really resilient to deal with that. Maybe you could volunteer at a soup kitchen during Thanksgiving so you could have a chance to be around others?
Did you do anything after she did it?
I have never had siblings so not sure what to tell ya.
Whys that? Did you specifically have a bad experience with them or just assume theyre terrible no matter what?
Trapped in a cave? I couldnt handle that. Im claustrophobic. Id freak out in a second. How long were you trapped for?
Some people are just cruel.
You should have called the police. If they were just vandals they probably did it to someone else to.
Thats annoying. Kids these days are really attached to electronics just how it goes. I know its hard to cut them off but have you tried managing his electronics time more closely?
I would be too. At that age they dont understand why they cant have it. Its like talking to a brick wall. I hope it gets easier for you as he gets older.
Did you practice first in a parking lot?
Did you use GPS?
I can understand that.  I feel like Trump should have gone to jail a long time ago
I totally agree with you
I think they are just empty threats but you never know.
You and me both. 
Why dont you move back?
Can you make new friends where you are now?
Oh no! How many days left until she starts school?
Wow thats some really slow shipping times. Maybe you will get lucky and they will come in the mail sooner.
I am totally with you
I am sure you could
Wow you can teach an old dog new tricks.
Indeed. It would be fun to see your friends again and be around them
I think being with children is a joy that not everybody can understand
How much is the phone?
Will you be able to pay that off quick thou?
Oh no. Did it ever come back?
That sucks. MY sisters dog used to roam the neighborhood a lot and one day he didnt come back either. His name was Oreo. I told my daughter he got married.
Where did you go?
I love New Orleans.
Awwww  i can relate to that.  I am so sorry.
I am very sorry to hear that
Who was it?
That was nice of them.
Im not too fond of winter but what kind of coat did you buy?
Awesome I bet its comfy! How cold does it get where you live?
When does he start?
I am sure he will have fun.
You may have more than you know but sometimes meeting new people will give you the fresh start you need
Neighbors coworkers.  Try and get involved in local sports or comunity groups.  How about volunteering.  That is a good way to meet people that are positive
Where did they come from?
Where did they go?
Im not particularly a fan of subways either but why are you so scared of being robbed?
I think the overall chances of that are pretty low. Though I do understand your fear.
So I take it you get along well with your boss?
Thats great to hear often times we here of people who hate their bosses!
That really is disappointing.  Can you fix it?
I am so sorry to hear that
Did you hurt yourself?
I am sure they have fallen before no big deal.
Im sorry to hear that. Why do you think that is? Is it a painful or happy memory?
I can understand that. That does sound like a difficult thing to deal with. Hopefully you have a lot of nice memories you can look back on to remember her by.
It is these delicate balance of our natural body that makes us to be diligent for survival
Indeed. Nature is very interesting and complex to interpret. Survival is the only mechanism that drive us to have certain physical features
I bet that was a nice surprise! Thats pretty cool. What was it for if you dont mind me asking?
Thats really cool... And also way above my head! But seriously that sounds like smart hard work. You should be proud. Im glad you got that moment in the sun.
Wow thats amazing! Shows that we cant judge a book by its cover. We automatically think it would take a large man to do something like that!
I would have been unable to move for the rest of the day!
Dang thats rough. Like a doubledose of sadness. My girlfriend and I are long distance so I know how that goes. Is there any way you can still keep in touch with them?
Yeah she and I dont use social media but I can imagine thatd be really helpful in your case. Well Im glad you at least have that. And maybe it will open up the possibility for you to meet new people too.
Well we dont like unnecessary attention and we dont like talking about ourselves. We just like skyping between each other and thats it. And talking on the phone of course.
Was it for school?
Did you get fired due to it?
That is a little daunting.  Have you considered joining some groups with likeminded individuals?
Check with your community center
Aww! How sweet! I can imagine the first few days are crazy.
I do not have any kids. Honestly too scared for child birth haha
Aw that is fantastic! How did yall meet?
Wow you guys meet pretty early on. Thats nice that you pretty much grew together as you became adults.
Hopefully a happy birthday is going to be in order soon!
Happy early birthday then.  Drink up!
Oh really! Any ideas why?
Maybe they like you?
Yes they can be fun I guess.
Yes that could be very annoying.
That is so sad. Did the kitten die? I hope not.
Oh I hope it was ok. I understand you not being able to stop.
No joke? Thats terrible. Why was the security camera off? And seriously who steals a lawn mower? What bums.
Oh that makes sense. I had no idea since Ive never used them. That sounds really inconvenient. Maybe they were waiting for the perfect moment to strike... What chumps.
Oh wow what luck! I bet you slowed down after that!
Well thats good that you use this as a reason to stop speeding. Some people never learn!
I love Colorado.
Did you have fun?
It is. Now we have to deal with rains and snows. So much to go for the next summer
I think climate change will only exacerbate the freezing temperatures during winter season
Why did you decide not to go?
Did you make it to the game at least?
What is the big end goal?
I think you can do it.
Thats not good. Whats wrong?
Oh man that would make me angry! Is there anyone you can call and report them anonymously?
Maybe you can sneak over and steal them?
oh no that would make me feel guilty!!! Is he okay?
is he allergic to that type of food? If not you need to transition him slowly! But thats funny lol
Who did you leave him with?
Did he destroy the house?
That sounds great.  What do you get to visit for?
That sounds like a great experience!
I was too! What do you think caused it?!
I agree with you. Having a good coach is crucial for team success.
What state is that?
That does surprise me actually.
Im sorry to hear that. It always sucks missing the good old days.
I can kind of see where youre coming from. I personally try to avoid too much nostalgia. Others seem to love it.
That is incredible. What a determination and dedication he must have put for achieving such a result
I wish I had that level of willpower to even lose a couple of pounds from my hanging waist fat
Wow I have never been! What all did you see?
Oh cool. What was you favorite thing at the square? 
A part in what?
What play is it?
That is rough news.  How long?
That is hard.  I am so sorry
What kind of puppies?
Why dont you buy one from your friend?
oddly enough so am I. I just want to be comfortable. How do you feel about that?
Thats very good do you feel content at the moment?
Did you spill something on it?
Are you excited about it?
I hope you have a great time!
Maybe you should take a different class.
You will have to study harder then.
Especially getting gifts from family. What a special holiday this is
How weird it may seem but my mom still gives me childrens book as a gift for each Christmas
Awww that is sad but happy al at the same time!
I hear that.  You hang in there
does that usually happen often? 
haha yeah it happens to me too. I bet youre frustrated about that. Have you tried different apps?
I know what you mean. It is always a reason to be proud.
I just set short term goals along the way.
What does he do for work?
Well you could always pick up a new hobby! What is something youve always wanted to learn?
Oh man. Why is that?
That is wonderful to hear
Dont ever forget why!
What time is it at?
Make sure you get there early.
Have you spoke to her?
Oh yeah me too man you like the fall?
Yeah me too its very comfortable. What else do you think about it?
Why do you think that is?
I love my dog i still cheat on it.
How much did you win?
Do you have any of it left?
Yes I prefer the fall also.
That football starts.
Im sorry about your loss. How are you doing?
What exactly happened?
Thats great! What makes you so confident?
Well that awesome to hear! I hope you do get it soon!
Gold club where?
How many holes does it have?
Oh no!  What does he do that is so annoying?
It is nice that he wants to stay connected I guess
Who are you going with?
Nice have they been before?
you were? Was your pregnancy planned
hahah oh man finally that is so good! Congratulations on your children
Oh no! Have you bought a test yet? Were you trying?
Thats scary! I hope that you arent pregnant then!!
I hope so
What is the disagreement about?
I agree. What do you think will help people get along?
Yes when I was little.
I also had a dog did you find your dog?
That is terrible i would cry as well.
you can always adopt thats what we did!
Nice was model is it?
Oh wow! Thats awesome that your friend unexpectedly surprised you. 
I bet that was really heartwarming. Im glad you had that experience. 
Tell me about it. I got like 3 hours last night
Hey! Girlfriends just need an ear some time. 
you can do whatever you want!! You like beer?
oh okay I see lol chugging reminds me of high school
What do you do with her?
Is she still alive?
Yes you will with that attitude
That is the key isnt it?
Congratulations! You and your family must be delighted to have a new member!
I am sure that you will be a great parent. You clearly show that you already love your new born daughter.
I would cry very much!
I would cry and cry for days.
But you just said you do like them.
What are you going to buy?
What store will you go to?
I had to use a subway once to get to work on time.
It was ok but while on the train I lost my phone and somebody returned it to me.
Do you enjoy your free time or are you sad?
Cool I have a pair of jeans.
When will you wear them?
Did you get sleepy while studying?
i would have fallen asleep for sure.
I live and take care of my grandmother too!
Yea I feel that it is worth every second of it! They are the reasons we exist
That is understandable.  You need to let it happen naturally. Be with your friends and find yourself
I understand.  It will happen for you if you keep an open mind and dont rush
did you not want to leave them with someone else?
it is did you have fun?
Vegas is always a popular destination for vacation!
Clubs are so fun! Any specific ones in mind?
Thats terrible! How did you punish your dog?
Maybe your dog has learned its lesson.
What happened on it?
Wow sounds like you have good fiends and it was fun.
Thats good. Some people dont appreciate anything.
Thats a blessing too. I happy that my family is healthy too.
Oh no!  What happened?
That is really ridiculous that they shut it off over just 1 though!
Aww thats a nice story. Im glad you have that to carry with you.
Im thinking of a time that a party was thrown for me as a surprise. All those people getting together was really fun.
These nostalgic emotions are unique and very pleasant to have. I sometimes rewind them in my mind just to escape from my anxiety
Old memories that are good tend to help me emotionally and mentally. Not those that were distressing
Did you ask why your partner refused. That is very weird.
That is okay at least she was honest with you about her preferences.
I would guess that if your survival mode you will do whatever you have to.
I would like to think that I wouldnt but if it were that or die Id eat.
What happened? Did you?
Thats perfect then im sure you did a great job
Tell me exactly what that was like? Hopefully its different now?
I could not even imagine how mad your parents must be.
Nice! I bet it is a very cute puppy.
That is just adorable! You should take many photos before it grows too big!
yes i am mortified jeans ripped
 i am working
Woah! That is great news. Have you told anyone yet?
I dont blame you at all. You just received life changing news.
You are so right. It can make all the difference.
It is challenging to raise children. Everybody could use a hand.
I feel the same way. There are so many people who are struggling now.
Its such a difficult situation that you just dont know where to begin.
Great  So you found out already that you got it or are you just confident?
that is upsetting.  I am sorry to hear that
ok you going to your family
That can be upsetting. Did they tell you why?
Maybe its time to look for another job.
That is impressive.  Why did you doubt them?
Is it something you are happy with?
I hate interviews the most.
Sure you can work for yourself!
Is there any emergency need for money?
Its our responsibility to take care of our parents. 
That is great1
You must have been so proud!
Kids are amazing. How old are they?
Great ages to have lots of fun with.
That is fantastic.  What for?
That is awesome!
What does that mean exactly?
I would love a vacation!
Ps4 is the best system to play on!
I love beating others.
Can you be more specific about what things you had lost in the past?
So you consider yourself a general loser in life?
I am with you.  It is horrendous
I agree with you
Is it still there? 
It sounds like that experience made a lot of amazing memories for you.
I can understand that.  Were you by yourself?
that is good to hear
I wouldnt be so sure of that. Even the best trained dogs can run when given a reason.
Ha Ha. They all are until they run.
That is nice.  What show?
That is really cool
Because of the movie or where you were parked?
It must have been really good to keep you scared afterwards.
Thats awesome! what was the project?
you must be very clever
I just got Netflix back.  What is good?
That sounds good.  
Oh no. Thats sad. What was wrong?
Im sorry. That must have been hard
I could never ever sing.
I can barely even talk!
Oh What was your age when youve stolen?
Its happening all around. If were repeating the same itll become a bad habit.
They may consider that shoplifting. It would be terrible to go to jail for grapes.
I think I would stop doing that. Jail doesnt appeal to me.
Cool. Are they still the same?
Are you gonna get together again?
Did you party after?
I partied like crazy after graduation.
Dont be daft! Kids should never watch tv!
They have tv inside the school do they not?
Even I love anime and i stopped watching tv a few years ago maybe I shall return.
Well thats understandable.
What kind of job was it?
Oh wow!  I have actually worked there too
I love apple pie. I feel you.
You brought yourself. I am a glass half full type of lady lol
You are  lucky to be able to have that kind of relationship. 
You have a strong foundation. Even if she wavers she will return.
We will see. Dont worry so much.
Good for you. I like a positive attitude.
I hate when that happens
Being courteous isnt that hard. People just dont try
Yeah? What do you need to buy?
How many kids do you have?
Cool What are you going to do?
Well thats good if its quiet.
Why and what did happen?
Oh be positive try your best.
Oh well it wasnt on purpose. People lose things.
Really? Why? Theyre so small.
Oh no! Have you put traps down?
Ok. Had any interviews yet?
Lol. Well good luck. Job searches can be tough.
Those are the kind you better keep a watch on. You never know what he might do.
Dont engage with him he will think that your interested.
Is the coworker your friend?
You probably shoulf have told them that wasnt a decent thing to do. 
I hope it is  do you have any funny experiences from the bad ones?
Im sorry to hear that. Youll find somebody good soon!
Really? Are you watching training?
Oh you mean soccer lol
I will agree with you there. We use whatever words we want.
How exciting for you. 
Theres always hope in a new beginning.
What was the movie? Save me
Well thanks for nothing lol
Ive never had a pair either  but I dont despise them. Why do you feel so strongly?
Yeah  I dont see why someone would spend so much either.
Maybe were just jealous!
Wow. I have never even tried. Seems complicated.
Maybe I will try one day.
What do you make best?
Never even had it before.
ya i am interesting to help for people
Thats a hard thing to deal with. Do you think shes really hungry?
Maybe her body clock is out of whack.
Omg. I love her. 
Do you have any of your own?
Im sure you would with all that experience!
Wow. Was it intersting?
I have no idea who that is. Sorry.
Football or soccer?
Whats your favorite team?
Why do you hide snacks from your kids?
That does not seem very nice.
Thats good to hear.
Thats good that you can get through and hopefully still care about each other.
I hope you can find the peace and keep up whatever friendship you may have.
Thats great. I understand sometimes we might need distance as well. But being cool with the other person is nice to see. 
Oh man! I feel sorry for you. What time is it where you are  1am?
Shame on you. 
Oh wow. Maybe you dodged a bullet.
Me too lol
Is it? Do you like dressing up then? Or is it the tricks?
You can make it every month! Have fancy dress parties for the kids
I bet I enjoyed it when I was 30 and pregnant!
Did you have any money?
Thats good he is nice like that.
What kind of test?
Biology isnt as easy as I thought either.
Good luck. Whats the job?
Cool. Ive done that before.
Does she? Do you want me to break her kneecaps for you?
Me too. Its not fair. Just message me her address and 1000 and Ill do it 
Yeah? Im sorry to hear that. Are you looking for someone else? Does that sound sleazy lol?
Oh dear. Maybe you dont need a man  Im one and can confirm that they are messy noisy and rude.
It sure can.
I hate that.
People should be more considerate though.
Jeesh was she not paying attention in class or is there some other issue?
I couldnt imagine my kid going so far as to hide something like that from me. Maybe she was just scared of how you would react.
Well you tend to be a bit overly serious about things maybe you should try looking at the issue from her point of view you know?
She is a kid man kids mess up. I cant imagine you were a beacon of honesty when you were a kid. 
Oh. Youre welcome lol
I read your journal
Im sldo in your closet
Really? Why is that?
Oh no! How does that make you feel?
I know right
Why are you done with voting?
You shouldnt give up on your government.
I hate horror films Too many nightmares.
Whose idea were those anyway?
That was nice. 
Probably Im scared of birds.
It flies. I am afraid of butterflies. Seriously
Well its to be expected all you do is sit in your house on the weekends. 
Well next weekend come out with me and the rest of the group bet we could find you a few interested guys.
Well lets not aim too high. How about we start with good looking and go from there.
Oh shoot! What happened are you okay?
What happened? I thought you guys were attached at the hip? 
I feel really sorry for you. Will you be okay?
I hope everything works out for you.
Thats nice do you get nervous?
Thats great do you have a warm up routine to get your ready?
Cool what do you do if you happen to be low on energy?
Was it an important appointment?
I havent seen it but I know a lot of people like it. 
Sounds good were you said throughout the series or because of an ending?
I appreciate that! I wish I had watched it so you could talk more about it. 
What about it is annoying? Isnt it better for the dog?
that does not seem safe for anyone. Is there anything you can do about it?
Im sorry to hear that. Are you OK?
Oh man. Thats so sad.
That sounds like fun.
I love the sunshine its great.
I can understand that viewpoint. Its a very complicated issue though!
Well done! Do you get a prize or anything?
Thats great. Keep up the good work
Why do you think you often feel that way?
Do you have any friends around that area?
That IS annoying.
That is wonderful good food makes for happy people
thats my favorite food too! no wonder it was lovely. you should cook italian food often then
Why not? That doesnt sound fun.
Im sorry the hear that maybe next time.
Absolutely. What happened?
Thats bad. Did any charges get pressed?
What kind of job do you want?
Accounting jobs are usually high paying j.
Oh wow. Thats awful Im sorry!
I understand. Will your insurance help you?
What was the hard work?
Good. WEll done then.
Wow!  Never mind the best is reserved  for the last
Dont give up! 
What did she say?
Congratulations. Thats amazing!
That is great news.  He must be lucky.
It seems like everything worked out for him.
Afraid of what?
Can you provide more details?
What do you mean?

So what  made it fondly? 
Nice!  Was it on a summer time? 
Congrats. You must be very proud of yourself. Will you celebrate?
I agree be sure to keeping up the good work! 
Oh no what happened to the car?
Wow that is so disgusting.
I agree. I thinking making a list helps with that.
I like to have a set of goals for the week to accomplish.
Did you mess on the order?
Wow.You must feel angry about that
That sounds amazing good for you!
How surprised were you about it?
I hope you didnt get any bad news from the doctor.
I am sorry to hear that. Hopefully its a treatable disease! 
Uhmnn so how do you  think  she would react? 
Anyway  you have to find a way of better explaining  hope hell  understand? 
That is unfortunate. You must have really angry to have wasted your time.
It has happened to me as well. Its very annoying when it happens.
What did he do to you?
You should not lend money to anyoneeven if it is your friend
Really  are you scared of missing it?
Me too  I get very stressed if theres even a chance of being late.
That shouldnt be allowed in the first place.
Oh my. I would be angry if that happened too.
What?  Was that freezed to have stayed that long? 
Uhmmnn!  Thats awful!  
What game were you playing?
Wow I am so happy for you!
Good job! A good education is great for your future.
It is very much worth it in the long run.
Congratulation. Good job.
Good. Self confidence is important. When did you get the promotion?
Oh my. How did that happen? I hope no one was hurt
Does your insurance cover fire damage?
OK get prepared! 
Well can only wish you luck!  You need to be bold 
Is it not about 2 years away?

Am so sorry  how did you handle it?
That can be tiresome. I hope you had it all handled at the end
Thats terrible will you be able to stay in school?
Well I hope you do better this year.
yes it appears a trade war might happen now!
I agree he needs to stop isolating the U.S.
That is a great surprise. Did you drive it?
You are very lucky.
It ran away? Better make sure cant do that again. Stressful 
I can imagine so
I am in the US. Why does it make you so angry? Ive never heard about.
I think I will Im very curious now. You think they would want to use their time more wisely.
Oh man thats a good way to end up on the couch.
You better find a way to make that up to her.
Why is that? Is it your favorite type of car?
I see turn that jealousy into motivation to get that Acura!
Congratulations. We have a boy on the way. 3 months to go!
I remember my surprise too. She tricked me all day and said she wasnt pregnant.
Well that really  bad!  
Well that goodness you were not caught that would have been expulsion 
The customized version of what?
Oh okay. What kind of car is it?
Oh wow that seems like a bad situation. 
Is there another company that may be able to help you?
What a happy time I bet you were very prouod and excited!! 
Yay that is awesome! Sometimes not knowing the gender of the baby is a very cool surprise they say.
Nice!  What is your favorite dish that she taught you?
Awww I am sorry.  At least she showed you how to make it!
Oh wow. That sounds like me and my husband!
That would make me mad too. How hard is it to throw stuff away?
That makes me so sad. Why is that so?
yes that can be a huge problem. Im so sorry youre having to go through that.
Of course Ive felt sad for many reasons. Things that happen in the world make me sad.
What makes me sad is hunger in the world. I cannot stand people suffering.
That is a reason to be sad but also to be furious
All people are the same.I understand why you feel ver sad and I guess frustrated too
Sorry to hear that. Why is that?
That must have been very upsetting. It happened to me back in 6th grade.
So did you get in trouble for it?
That would make me so mad!   I wouldnt even want to go to work!
That is pretty gross but it happens often.
If you plan on having a kid it will happen.
That sounds like so much fun!
I like the little roller coasters myself.
have they offered to buy you a replacement?
Thats not a very good friend then. accidents happen but you should own up to them  have you considered suing in small claims? youd at least get your money back to get a new phone
Sorry to hear that.IS she going to be under treatment?
Thats pretty kind of you.WHat is the doctor saying?
Yes they are. They keep us motivated.
My main one is to become a mother. I also want to be out of debt ASAP.
Have you talked to him about being a bit cleaner in general?
Ah thats a tough situation. Maybe some subtle hints would work best like leaving a deodorizer near his room.
Oh that sounds like fun! What kind of film did you see?
Action films on the big screen are very exciting with the loud sounds and visual effects!!
Do you want to do something special today?
you can read something
That mustve been hard. I love my dad the most of all family members
Im glad to hear that.
What did happen in the store? Why did your daughter throw a fit?
Oh did you convince her?
thats so adorable! how old is he? 
i bet i would be too 
oh cool how much was it? 
holy! thats a lot but she will get good use out of it 
oh my god 
Well done. You must be very proud of him.
Football is pretty much the only sport I like.
How did you feel relieved or disappointed?
Did they reschedule?
And what happened then?
Congrats. You must be very proud of yourself.
What did you do instead? 
well you could always take him out or do something he would like to make up for it im sure he wont mind 
I am sure that brought back memories
I do love those kind of memories
What are you worried about?
Ahh well I am sure you will have blast!
Oh no! Are you ok?
Im sorry to hear that. What caused the fire?
Oh tell me what happened.
That sounds like a very eventful day!
thats so cool where were you when you seen that? 
i would have been too thats really cool 
that happens to everyone
i hope she forgave you
Well done to you. Its not so easy to lose weight. What motivated you?
Having a good looking body is not just to look good its also a reflection of a healthy life. You should try and keep it.
Its a good attitude it keeps you young
keep like this ... happy
Ive been there. That must be rough. Whats going on ?
I am happy you worked it out. Stay loyal to each other. Its the most important thing
What are you overwhelmed by
I am sure it will begin soon
omg.. sounds terrible.. do you usually get storms like that in your area? 
it sounds like it well i am glad everyone is okay 
Im sorry how did she take it?
Hopefully she will forgive you for it.
It must have been quite interesting. Did it make you feel hungry?
Oh my I can see why. It must have been very noisy and animallike
Where are you camping? 
Who did? And Im sorry to hear that.
I am sorry for your loss. 
thats a terrible situation you are in has it been resolved? 
Yeah that sounds really bad! 
I see it will be alright. You just have to be positive!
You must be feel a bit guilty but thats okay
How long did he study for? 
awesome good for him... what will his career choice me now? 
I am sure they will do fine
She sounds creative
That is an example of an awesome parent.  It is good to know he has got your back!
I am sure it really helped your self confidence and feelings of worth.
That sounds so annoying
Just be civil as much as you can
Well it is a good thing you had so much faith in your father.
It is good you had someone so reliable in your life.
I bet you were good at it
That is pretty impressive
Oh wow.  Have you ever been in a torando?
People tend to say that...which makes me more curious and wanting to be in one haha
Im sorry I think its an opportunity to start a new job better
thats right ... but you have to keep going ... I know that you will do well
... I congratulate you ... its good news!
that gives a lot of confidence ....
i believe this story please tell me ore
such a manly thing to do dont you agree ?
So...what did you do
That sounds like a blast. Who are you going to see?
That is fun is it an inside thing or outside?
whaaat that is insane! Alright he must be doing something really LEGAL right? lol 
some people really are like that though. I am not one of those people tho. 
I agree but you do not need much in life to be happy if you are a content person
i am happy for you
Maybe but maybe not. I bet it would be a lot of fun to have such a nice pool if you had the money for it. 
I mean I would never be able to afford that but if they can then it is nothing for them to do the routine care.
did he ?
you have a great dad
wow i closed 2 weeks ago
it truly is
were you drunk? 
lol well atleast you are honest! 
hope he takes care of it
you are a good friend  i would never let my friend borrow mine
that literally makes no sense like i get it you are homeless but no reason to be dirty! ugh 
probably so either way still disgusting 
Well go ahead know that women are an art that you get many attempts
quiet were like that ... youre right
Youre not alone Ive got a bunch of debt to pay off
For now I just sweep it under the rug and pretend like it doesnt exist. So after that point my life is pretty much perfect
i am so proud of you keep it up 
you are probably older now as well
Sometimes youve gotta live with regrets.  Accept it as part of your past life and move on
Same Ive put my parents through a lot.  But now Im trying to be the best version of myself so I can eventually pay them back
that is a very positive way to think i wish i could think like you 
ill try my best and see where it gets me 
I know its awful! How much did your rent go up?
Wow...You need to find a new place to live because thats completely unreasonable.
Thats gross! Did you complain to your landlord?
Wow thats pretty bad. I would complain to someone higher up because thats just disgusting! 
you sound so motivated thats really great! I believe in you
It does motivate me too! 
I do remember that and I think there is a lot of nostalgia there
I love things that remind me of my childhood it is even more fun to share it with our kids
Really! What was it?
That sounds amazing! What was in the box???
I think most people are really.  Anything specific about it?
Yeah thats a scary thought.  I try to think about what I can leave behind and hope theres something past death.
Oh thats awful. What will you do to make it right?
Yeah I think thats a good idea. I hope it all turns out for good.
Oh no!  It seems as though everything turned our OK right?  I am sure you were strong!
That is great!  It was all worth it in the end.
Oh my!  I am glad to hear you managed to avoid the collision.
Young people never appreciate the danger of speeding.
what are you getting done
ouch  gargle some whiskey
give her an unlocked phone 
is she being billed for data though ?
thats not nice of them. is that parking lot assigned to you?
they should be nicer! im sorry they are so inconsiderate
Wow youre so well spoken. 
so how do you better yourself?
Maybe there is rain in the forecast
Probably a lot are on vacation  especially now.
Im sorry to hear that.  Did they replace the plant as well?
I hope it comes back.  Fertilizer is always an experimental thing. Plants are so finicky.
Oh wow! I remember my parents getting them so much. Why would someone need that now?
Possibly but I doubt it could be worth anything. I would have thrown it out.
did you cry ?
i love the old days as well
Oh my that must have been super embarrassing. Did you get red faced?
Did you ask for her number afterwards?
That seemed nice of her maybe she felt bad about something?
Oh so she gave you money to kind of persuade you to do it?
uhhh i know how you feel!! we have some young neighbors downstairs and sometimes they have late night parties in their apartment
tell me about it. i even talked to them several times but they dont care
That must have been amazing to see!  Did you try to scare it away or just watch it?  Be careful since it sounds like it may be dangerous.
Wow!  Definitely be careful then!
That was some bonus. If you go to I think South carolina they have a factory somewhere there and they are cheaper I think
A friend got one used down there near Spartanburg.
Aw well Im sure a child that young doesnt really need it.
Well maybe you can practice and get better at it for when your baby is older.
Thats good. One should always appreciate family.
I see healthy relationships should be cherished!
That is fair I would be as well
I undertstand that I would be very upset as well
That is cool though does it still run fine?
Wow that is a good run though great job keeping it running!
Sorry to hear that. I have lost all my grandparents so I know the feeling. 
Yeah it takes a long time to get over .  And its never easy.
That is so sad humans made a huge impact on animals lives in that sense
It makes me feel sick as well I hit a bird once and almost cried
Thats great. It seems that everything is going well for you.
Thanks. I guess you are quite happy about everything.
wow i am happy for you
around christmas right
I am aspriing to be one congrats!
not yet I am still young
I know how you feel.  I have siblings as well.  They are quite important and give life meaning.
That is a great attitude and outlook to have!
I am so sorry to hear that!
I unsderstand that entirely
Ive been there it can really suck to be lonely.  It sounds like youre doing better though 
Im glad to hear it.  Its great to have found someone.
why is that?
Werent we are like that...
That will be a ton of fun to play!  I rememeber when the first one came out what a blast.  Now I have to go get a switch!
What is your favorite game?
I would imagine that is a huge event! My favorite game was Zelda by the way
You should there are tons of age appropriate games like Mario Kart and Splatoon!
Sounds interesting. Id love to check that out!
Its a Mariotype game isnt it?
Lebron is preparing for life after basketball therefore he picked LA he achieved what he wanted 
He doesnt have anything else to prove to anyone
Mine too.  How many do you have?
awww a 1 year old.  I miss when my daughter was that young.
maybe he was not watching where HE was going
at least he didnt hit you
Thaqt is too bad.  I like cats but not the mean ones only the sweet ones.  What does the cat do that is so bad?
Yeah I wonder what has made it so mean.
hi thats sad. have you tried looking for facebook events? like local events. i bet you can meet people there
You can always talk to me. im here for you
It is a interesting and relaxing way to end a evening. Ive been there before.
Sorry to hear that.All we can do is learn from itreally.
Oh my gosh how terrible. Did you have them saved on your computer?
I guess you had to redo it all again?
That is terrible is it someone you like? or did you not even know her?  I dont know which is worse.
Can you laugh about it now that you look back at it or has not enough time passed yet?
Oh my did you find out who it was?
You must have been quite relived that it was just your dog!
That is a relief Ive been in a similiar situation.  I know its hard to bring yourself out of a hole I can barely see the light at the end of the tunnell
Im struggling myself with 5 kids and 1 big kid my husband I feel like I should just buy a farm to be able to keep up. LOL
im sorry to hear that. i hate when my wife and i argue. are you feeling any better? did you have a chance to talk to your husband after that?
i hope everything will go back to normal asap and i hope he will apologize for making you feel small
Holy cow why did you take that bet?
What was the bet about?
Good for you healthy relationships are the best part about life!
I agree going through life alone would be boring!
That is awesome I am trying my best these days
That is good that takes a lot of work!
did you drink a lot back then 
i am glad you are in a better place now
Thats awesome! It sounds like your life is going pretty smoothly  Any big plans?
Oh awesome! Did you buy a house?
When you feel rain ... sometimes you feel its magic ... ask the children
youre right ... then the umbrella always at hand
of everything there is always something to learn
good luck with your learning
did y0u get it ?
awesome does it pay well ?
How young were you?
That is not bad then that is being a kid
sounds like your life is perfect. thats amazing. im happy for you
where do you work?
That is amazing that is a huge life event!
That is crazy how time flies like that! Next thing you know he will have a girlfriend
Blood is blood.
That is correct. It painful to see your loved ones been hurt
Wow congrats I know that is not a fun process at all so great job!
Indeed. That is the whole purpose of getting a degree and education. Isnt it?
Well it can also depend of your communication skills and how you can entice employers
That is great is it far from home?
That is not bad at all best of luck with that!
That is a lot to be thankful for!  You must be feeling really good!
That is a great place to be.  Count your blessings!
Which system was it? My message got cut short but I love nintendo the switch is amazing!
i bet you did and im sure you got the job
what do you do
How far away is that? I have never heard of it!
Oh that should be awesome have a great time!
Oh man so sorry dude. Hope your coping.
Why did she break up with you? Was it a long term relationship? 
I agree I often reminisce about my childhood. 
You just have to stay positive dude happiness is a relative concept.
Audis are nice cars. What color is it? Does it look newer?
Oh nice. Do you have a car?
that is very thoughtful of you
you are very ambitious
about what may I ask?
Is the person someone you know well a long time friend a family member?
I would talk to your brother and let him know how concerned you are and ask him for reassurance 
Thats so nice of them! Was it a surprise party?
Hahaha We take those things for granted! Happy belated birthday!
I can imagine it caught many people off guard.  I hope everyone came out ok in the end.
Thats good.  The only thing that matters in the end is our lives and health.
its never too late
i for one have not start saving yet
According to my knowledge and understanding I believe that you did something really prudent
Moderation in driving is important to avoid dangerous situations
oh my that must be embarresing
well that sounds more pleasant
Is that your brewski of choice
Always been a fan of Corona though lately Ive been chugging Hurricanes and Keystones
oh i bet you are nervous. Im sure she will be okay but i would be so nervus
Thats great! i see you trust her so much you have wonderful relationship with her
Its alright maybe its a working day and she has a surprise for you on saturday
Did you check everywhere in the room? maybe she has a surprise  gift hidden somewhere for you to find out
I think you should call the cab company and try to locate the driver!
Yes I will pray as well. But try not to let it bite your conscience. 
but thats so exciting! you will have so many good moments in your new house
I understand. is your new house far from the old one?
I understand that I hate bugs even alive ones
I get that I am the same way
That is very sweet. I assume you guys are close.
That is great that you have that kind of relationship.
Was your house okay?
Good being safe is all you can ask for!
My boyfriend just bought a Nintendo Switch last week. It was expensive!
I will have to ask him about the Super Smash Bros game. Most likely hes looking forward to it as well!
He was dirty and I had to bathe him very thoroughly.
Bloods thicker than water whether you like it or not
tell me why
That sounds fun though I am a lightweight after about 5 drinks I am about out of it
I like Vodka but mixed with stuff to kill the taste I hate beer though it is nasty to me
you should go
it could have been worse you know
That is great! I bet they are thrilled! Is that you favorite team?
They are pretty talented.
That sucks.  Its the same for me only its because we recently moved and I dont know anyone outside of work yet.
Ouch.  Were you too busy to go with them?
are they alive or gone ?
yes they will believe in it
I know that was the case for many I am sorry that impacted you 
Many people did he was a likeable fellow!
That has happened to mekids are brutal
That is for sure with online bullying existing now too
That makes me sad to hear.  Do you have lots of friends now?
I think it is better to a few really good friends than a lot of acquaintances.
Glad youre doing well
What are three traits that got you to where you are now
Nice talking to ya
I love nintendo and that series
what system do you have
How old were you?
Ah okay that makes sense at least it was sort of legal!
oh my thats pretty funny
hahaha you are funny
Oh wow that was brave. Did you get caught?
That was pretty risky. Did you get sick?
I saw one for the first time ever too! Where did you see it at?
I was in the US when I saw it thought it has been a while since it happened.
Well thats good news.
What kind of work do you do
Well you shouldnt fear things we have no control over anyway. Im sorry you feel anxiety over this.
I guess I can agree with that. I dont like it when people criticize millenialls too much though. Baby boomers didnt do that great either.
Why?  What happened??
That stinks.  Are there any other possibilities for advancement coming up?
I know the feeling.I miss my 2 boys also
I imagine but i am sure the family will be reunited soon.
Why do you think people would be that irresponsible? 
Not all people would be that way and I think for the most part most people would take responsibility for their actions. 
Uh oh. Did he ruin some furniture?
That is too bad. I bet you were not happy.
My brother did too! Hes the oldest so he got all the good stuff 
Aw  I bet other people appreciate you a lot!
I hear you.  Jokes are one thing family is another.
I dunno if Id go quite that far but you do you P
I bet you were glad you made that purchase!
That was very lucky timing.
It is so frustrating when someone elses issues affect your life.  What does she do to make you late?
That might be a good solution for you.  Let her catch all the flack for her tardiness.
That is absolutely horrible! Was this recent?
I agree. You should bring that up to HR. 
Seems like this speech was very important to you why?
Ahah than it makes a lot of sense.
Thats awesome! Are you excited?
How long did it take you to make it?
Thats an unfortunate predicament to be in.  What did you end up doing?
Thats a tough decision for sure but you definitely cant get fired for something like that and kids are exposed to germs all the time.
I get nostalgia all the time.  Were they family pictures
Cool.  Do you still keep in touch with those friends
That is a good approach! Has it been successful?
That is great to hear! I am happy for you!
its really more disapponted and hurts a lot.
dont feel everything goes good 
yeah that good 
iam always happy to think about it. my childhood memory was a great part of our life
Nice! Where at
Cool traveling what are your plans so far
Ah Ive made plenty of dumb choices in my life too. Honestly I think its part of being young
Thats good  But you are the wiser for it
I know. The game was full of intrigue. They truly deserved the win
You should definitely get a tattoo of his name on your chest
I am so sorry to hear that.  Losing a loved one is definitely one of the hardest things in life.
Maybe they just need some time to let the emotions settle a bit.
sounds fun how long were you there
aw what was your favorite things to do while there
Congratulations.  What did you get your degree in?
Good luck with any future business ventures.
I am very sorry for your loss.
A loss is never easy especially one in the family.
That is so cool what kind of video game was it?
That is so amazing.  Are you a professional gamer? 
I wish I was that good at gaming.  What a fun way to make a living!
that is a great news congratulate him from my side too. what is the major?
If the journey is tough then you are in the right path. So she is heading in right way. Great.
Nice! What did you whip up today
I LOVE steak..just had some steak brisket and fajitas yesterday
thats an amazing memory to have have you since visited her or sent her a card? 
I would call the school and see if they can disclose that or maybe they can accept the card from you to give to her! 
Oh no!  Im so sorry!  I hope you could pull your grade up!
What a nice person you are! I bet she appreciates you
You have a good set of morals. Thats becoming more uncommon lately. So good on you!
I am sure the stress will be worth it in the end.  Just keep encouraging him!
Those are good traits to have.  Good for him!
It is a great desire that you can achieve just rely on your abilities to independently do what you know.
I wish you can achieve success in your projects.
Did you present?
That is great!
Is it something you enjoy? 
I know we are all different but maybe getting another puppy would help? 
Oh that is so scary! I bet you were terrified!
Were you unharmed though?
Lol  I think my son has done that  he use to embrasse me when I would go to the store when he was little by crying a lot 
No any more he is a lot older and does pretty good on his own  but the thing is he is always close by if we in the store together .Yes I do believe that the human are weird 
Im guessing youre talking about your son?
Parenting is hard respect to you and your patience
That is awful! I hate people who leave their dogs out all day. Thats no life for a dog to live at all.
That is terrible. I dont know why people like that bother getting a pet. 
that is so beautiful! how old is she? 
i bet it was omg thats so adorable 
that is so scary.... you must have been terrified your baby too! How are you doing today? 
I cant even begin to imagine honestly im sorry you had to experience that 
That is horrible!  How could they justify doing that?  You must have been disgusted with them!
I can imagine.  I hope it all works out for the best and that you are able to come away from this as a stronger person.
Congrats.  They must be excited.
I am sorry to hear that.   Why are you upset about this?
That is terribly sad. I volunteer at our local shelter. I just love dogs.
That is so happy to hear! Its the nice things like that that make it worth it to volunteer.
Wow I bet that was a really big deal!  What was it about?
I hope he did well.
I think a lot of people are.  What in particular astonishes you?
Yes hes definitely unpredictable and capricious.  Is there anything about him you do like?
Oh wow that must have kept you awake for a while!
She scared me too I hope youre not scarred for life!
I know that feeling.  Its a trip when I look through family albums
Do you still keep in touch with the homies
I would enjoy the peace and quiet!  Kick back relax and do whatever you want.
Well in that case I hope they come home soon.  My family is just annoying mostly.
I have not I was hoping they called you instead.
That sounds like good planning to me.
I do too. I dont like to think about it because I start to feel weird.
That is awesome. Things change a lot out of high school.
Great.Did you decided were to go on your vacations?
I have been there before.Your are gonna have a lot of fun.
what exactly were you referring to
oh try to politely get the truth by speaking in a diplomatic manner by not hurting her ego
Thats great! How old is she?
If she is really good she could get a scholarship.
Why did she get sick? What was wrong?
Oh no Im sorry! I hope she is feeling better and you are too!
Yeah me too. They are unbelievable. 
Yeah it is hard to imagine how they pulled that off.
Great. I hope you have a lot of fun.
5 years is a long time.You have a lot to catchup.
Wow how did he get so much money if he didnt have money to pay his fees and what were the fees for?
What a great job to get. 
It must have been an overwhelming experience how old are the kids now?
Sweet we all miss those memories of them growing back. Mine are adults now
Why did you feel irritated? 
Oh that sounds super annoying! Sorry for that!
That is so sad! That poor dog.
Oh it survived! What a lucky dog.
Oh Im sorry to hear that. The only thing that helps is time unfortunately.
After some time passes though youll wonder why you were so sad.
I think he should exercise more selfrestraint when it comes to your relationship
That is very dangerous attitude to have. I would be very cautious as it may bring much unintended social consequences
do you act surprised ?
did you drink a lot ?
How does he go about showing it off? 
that sounds really childish of him lol 
Did you apologize and do something nice to make up for it?
Wow!  Well everyone makes mistakes and if you apologized and bought her a ring that should about cover it lol.
You should be proud of the fact you have a new home to build a lifetime of memories in.
You all have reason to celebrate.  You should throw a huge party to thank them.
Wow! Congrats! Ive heard thats very difficult to do.
Good for you. Do you feel any different health wise?
Oh yeah? What job did you apply for?
Thats great! I really hope you do get it you sound very excited.
Cool what did you get?
Nice what brand was it?
Ive only heard a little about them but theyre a good brand! Did you get it yet or are you still waiting?
That sounds like fun! I love family time!
Yes it sure is! We must appreciate the things that money cant buy too!
Oh that is so scary! What happened after?
Oh no. I hope everything worked out okay!
Nice!  Did you use that extra to do anything special?
Thats probably the best choice.  I was thinking you could use it to spruce up a new place a bit which it sounds like you did 
That sounds like a really fun and joyful surprise.  Young birthdays are amazing.
Yeah after 21 they really are pointless.  Most of my birthdays I enjoy a good dose of work all day lol.
I think that would be a very wise idea.
Are you working a full time job?
I am sorry to hear that. I know that would be hard.
I hope things get better for you.
Did you try to reason with them?
You should report them to the authorities
thats so awesome....... what uni is it? 
impressive my god! you really must be so proud... 
Yeah I love that feeling you need to cherish it!
Thats good try to figure out what caused it!
god.... did you have any extra clothes or able to change? 
sounds like a good reason to leave maybe i should spill juice on myself too lol 
Cool congrats what did you eat?
Well a promotion is always good. Did you have a burrito?
A dog is an awesome gift for a little kid.  I bet you were super excited.
I bet!  Maybe I should get my kids a dog for Christmas I know it would be a great choice for them.
Trimming down on the junk food? 
Oh okay I see. I understand being healthy is important. I hope you are being sensitive to her feelings though weight can be a touchy subject!
Your husband is just being a good daddy  hahaha you will miss the experience when the kid grows up
Then talk with him try to reason with him
That sucks but being lonely can sometimes help you discover new hobbies.
Yes your happiness doesnt depend on nobody else.
Thats no fair! Where you left out on purpose?
Yeah I would be upset about that too.
what orchestra was it or where was it? 
sounds very cool id love to go listen someday 
Turbulence always scares me lol. In reality the plane is very safe though.
How often do you fly? The more you do it the easier it gets.
Cool I lived in Palm Beach County for 2 years. I fly to the Philippines every few years and it takes over 12 hours!
That is so sad.  It sucks to end any relationship.
That seems like a pretty crazy reason to throw away four years.  I am sorry that happened to you.
I feel your pain. Its crazy how reckless some drivers can be. I was always taught the importance of using my signals.
Honestly in Florida I see similar behaviors among some drivers. Im not sure if they are rushing or just dont care.
Thats cool I guess...do your parents not trust you in their own house? lol
Gotcha. Well glad it worked out for ya
someone forget to pay the bill? 
that is a very good story
I bet. Thats so sweet.
Were you able to record the moment?
Thats unfortunate did you end up with a ticket?
Ouch I hope it wasnt too expensive.
I havent played video games in years I really need to buy a system but I dont even know where to begin now adays lol 
I liked it better when it said releash I figured you had a lisp.  lol joking  I will check into it! thanks 
Did you need the money for something specific? 
Were you able to sleep last night?
Did you get hurt?
Glad to hear that.
I always get nervous too... never know what they will find right ! Whats wrong? 
jeez thank god! ugh glad you are okay 
I can understand the holidays are exciting almost there though.
I hope its worth the wait!
That is nice of you. Family is great to have when you get older.
Yes it is. I am glad you are there for your grandmother!
Oh no that is really sad. You should research your dogs allergies so that it does not happen with other foods.
That is great! I hope your dog gets better fast.
Oh I bet that was super frustrating! How did you react?
Younger siblings tend to be that way sometimes.
Great where are you going?
I agree its better to overpack than underpack.
I am so sorry to hear that!  Dont worry.  I know it is hard but every day will get better.
Just be strong.  She is in a better place now.
How exciting! Why did you choose Tahiti?
The photos of Tahitian beaches Ive seen are beautiful! Will you be visiting a beach?
Oh no! Was she okay or did she cry?
That is good Im glad she was okay. I once got hit in the face with one so I know it can sting.
I am sorry to hear that. Can I ask why?
I dont think you should feel ashamed at all. Parents are there to help you until you are able to manage on your own.
and how do you feel about it? Are you ready?
Then thats good! I am glad you feel confident that will help!
That is a great idea! I need to do that as well seems I always forget something!
That is great! Im happy for you!
Oh no I hope it wasnt unwarranted!
Its definitely a difficult position to be in I hope your coworkers were understanding.
Omg how many months were you pregnant before this happened?
im so sorry to hear about this
Oh that is a tough one! You have to tell her no matter what! Just suck it up and break it to her!
I know you are scared but this was a choice you made now you have to deal with the consequences.
We will always have fond memories that come to our minds. I am sorry to hear that but also happy you can have the memoru. 
Yes she is! 
What was the prize you didnt win?
Oh well Im sure theres always next year! Was it a fitness test or what
It is good you are happy with your current position. What do you do?
That is awesome! Im happy for you!
Wow it must be a very recent and trendy hair style
You husband must be very happy with the style
I understand a lot of people have issues with him.  What makes you embarrassed?
Well in his business dealings in the past it probably served him well to be blunt and agressive.  I can see how that would bother some people
I am sorry to hear that.Is the poilice helping you.
You should install security cameras around your house.
That is so nice. Moms are the best. You are lucky to have a good one!
I definitely will! My mom is sick  so I plan on spending all the time with her I can!
Thats so good for you! Are you going to save more money now?
I can imagine! I hope youre able to save a lot and have good financial security.
Do I even wanna hear it? Okay tell me... what happened? o
So you had chocolate covered ants! I bet thats pricey somewhere in another country! ha ha 
oh man did you forget?
well hopefully she understands too you seem pretty guilty about it.
Thats sounds like a very smart and effective safety precaution. Was it enough to adequately defend your family?
Did you end up feeling like you had stronger defenses than the hurricane had strength when it reached your area? I mean in an overprotected kind of way.
That is really sad. Many people I grew up with have passed from overdose. Its tragic.
I dont believe it is either. Im so sorry to hear about your friend.
That is great. Did you buy anything else?
So you have relatively new computer essentials. Sounds like you are set for the next while.
That sounds cool what did the circus consist of? Did they have elephants?
Cool! I havent been to a circus in years. I think I should go again soon.
Thats pretty cool.  It always helps to have someone helping you when youre sick.
I had a girlfriend who was really caring. Baked me a birthday cake made me a scarf and bought me clothes...but I messed it up and were no long together but you live and you learn
oh man do you miss it? How about your brother?
oh yeah thats way too cold! Im sorry you feel a bit homesick. Remember you are away because you are bettering yourself
Ouch!  That had to feel embarrassing!  Did you apologize?
Thats good.  That shows your true character.
Wow! That never happens! You must have been so excited! 
I would have bought more tickets hoping I was having good luck after that! 
Thats sucks. You must have been devastated when you got the news.
Youll get over it. Theyre probably up in heaven watching over you now.
I am too actually. I dont care for them at all!
Theyre obsessed with guns what do you expect?
Are you ok? How is your recovery?
You are lucky to have a topnotch doctor helping you.
Thats great from the sound of it your probably thought it was going to be boring huh?
That must have been very entertaining to watch then. Im glad you enjoyed it so much.
Oh no are you feeling any better now? Or are you still having problems?
Oh well that sounds like a step in the right direction at least. I hear vocational school is great for many different kind of jobs usually more physical.
That is very risky and volatile!  With no risk there is no reward!  I am rooting for you!
That is a good position to be in.  There have been millionaires made in crytocurrency.
Oh wow! Whats better than a raise? A raise you didnt even expect!
Is it a pretty substantial increase?
Thats great. I bet shes never home now.
I know time flys by so fast. Congrats to her. Just tell her to be careful on the road.
I am happy to hear that! Any specific reasons?
Wow that is a huge achievement! Any parent would be proud.
That could happen to anyone.Dont feel so bad.
Keep trying and you will see improvments.
what about friend?
but what about?
Thats good launch you gat tere 
ok that is cool
Oh man that sucks. You may need to say something to her. 
Hopefully. Maybe she was having a bad day.
Wow! That mustve been a surprise 
She mustve really enjoyed the time. Where did you guys go out to eat? Was it nice?
Sounds cool! There isnt anything like that around here.
Wow that is a lot of money! Congrats!
If all else fails save it!
Wow! That must have been exciting. Were you nervous?
Oh that sucks! Did you relax a bit after take off or were you anxious the whole time?
Well you should.You did a nasty thing.
That really does not make a lot of sense.
what about it?
really? that seems to be an amazing event
Im not sure.  What baby is it?
Yeah thats my baby.  It learned to roll over after about 5 months.
Thats horrible! I hope it wasnt a lot of money!
Thats happened to me before. I hate trying to get things like that settled.
Oh my God thats terrible!  So sad.  Id be mad too.  What did you do?
Did the police come? I hope she got her stuff back
No kidding.  I would hate for that to happen to anyone else.
I bet.  The world can be so scary!  Im glad she was okay
Thats cool! Its nice to have someone close that is talented like that and can help with those things.
I always wish I was good at design. Ive tried but Im pretty garbage haha!
I used to play Madden a lot so I understand the excitement.  It is a fun game
I do enjoy football it means that fall is right around the corner and I love the weather
Me too god bless air conditioning
True  heat makes me angry
I used to collect too when I was a kid I still have some but they are probably worth nothing other than nostalgia.
Oh oh I got you neat!  So stuff you used to play in as a kid.  That is nice of you sports equipment can be expensive
Oh sure I played football in high school and still have my letter jacket and one really messed up jersey.  I dont think I would ever get rid of them
College in general tends to be a lot of fun.  Anything in particular?
Sounds like a grand old time.
Why cant you just move away when they smoke?
That seems like a rather complicated situation than.
Have you heard how shes doing at her new job? 
Yeah that sounds hard.  Im sorry youre missing her. 
Oh that sounds ominous!
That sounds scary! I hope it all ended okay!
Oh man I hate when that happens...did you dry it off or change to a new pair?
Dang that sucks.  You should check out the brand Mizzen and Main I heard it on a Tim Ferriss podcast once...dress shirts and pants that wick away moisture like underarmour
I can absolutely see where youre coming from! Growing up my parents were neither wealthy nor very poor but I feel like I had a great childhood.
I live pretty minimalist. I have the things I need to enjoy life like a home gym and a gaming computer while being able to afford living essentials. It doesnt take much for me to be happy.
How fun! That must have been scary to do that!
That is true! I bet it is taking a lot of time you must be exhausted!
Not very good. My insurance might not cover the damages.
Someone scratched my car and slashed my tires.
That is impressive.You must have a super memory.
I know.I was just being sarcastic with you.
Im sorry to hear that do you have positive memories that you can remember them with at least?
Oh well its good theyre still around.
oh sorry to hear this. you just want to make it up clean soon
you have to find the person who did this.then you should made the mess to clean it up
I agree man. Almost nothing feels as good as financial security.
But good lovin can be a bill.. if you know what I mean.
What do you do to get prepared?
Sounds like somebodys thinking ahead! Do you listen to a lot of Alex Jones
Maybe you could try AA meetings or suggest to your wife that she can go to Al Anon meetings. Its a good first start.
It worked for me and my husband. We were going through the same type of thing for about a year.
Talk to him wisely
Oh I mean talk to him in the way that he will understand. With love so that he reasons with you
I would be too! Have you had time to prepare?
Thats good. Im sure you will do good!
Ah I have so many fond memories of playing ball in the yard with my dad!
Thats fantastic  Nostalgia is an amazing thing
Thats amazing! I bet he was elated.
Youll have to congratulate him for me. What a great accomplishment.
You must be so happy? What was the job you got a interview for?
Is the nanny job close to where you live?
Thing very carrefully before making this important decision.
She is probably working hard to provide a better life for the family.
You must be taking good care of her in and out if you know what I mean
I hope you can make her realize how grateful you are by being faithful
Oh me neither! I dont like a cheater!
Seems simple but nobody does it that way it seems like.
Oh yeah? What song is it?
Oh man just saying that name brings back nostalgia for me!
That is great but I take she is not alive anymore??
Well she is in a better place for sure.
I would have to agree with you there. I dont trust him at all!
I agree. I cant understand how his supporters dont see it! I guess they dont WANT to see it!
Youll be fine. It will be a great learning experience.
I agree but the journey makes it worth it. Youll meet new people and have new experiences.
Thats awesome.  Do you go kayaking often?
Do you own your own kayak or do you rent?
I want to get a sea kayak I like to fish
Its also a lot cheaper than a boat and you can get into the shallow salt flats easy.
Thats very irritating! Is it difficult to change the headlights in your truck?
Yeah that shouldnt happen. I hate changing the headlights on my car. They made it really tough to get to.
I can see the appeal. I have the opposite situation. Tiny subcompact but goes a long time on a tank.
Seems incredible but also kind of boring at the same time.
Was anyone else there watching him too?
What did your son do that makes you so happy?
Thats great! Im sure that you are a very proud parent!
Good for you.It looks he is making an effort.
He just proved he loves you a lot.
Why are you anxious about the counry?
I think well be fine.   Peopel talk a lot about a trade war but leave out the fact that places like the EU already tax our goods at much higher rates than we tax theirs.      How can they call us raising our tariffs a trade war if theyre still lower than what they bill us? 
Congrats.I bet they were very impress with you.
I bet they will never challenge you again.
Yes It feels disgusting and you want to throw your shoe away afterwards. 
No never barefoot. I hope you took a long shower. Smelling like dog poo wont get you any ladies.
That would be tough. Have you found a support group to go too?
That would be difficult! I cant imagine the pain you must be going through. Sounds like yall have good memories together.
That sounds like a great gandma! You are so blessed to have those memories with her!
My mom thinks that her grandmas spirit is in me because she died right before I was born.
Im sorry interviews can be rough. Was there a part of the interview day that you found especially difficult?
Maybe it went better than you thought! If not you still gained some experience from the day.
pets are good as they keep company
oh my god its like a most heartbroken moment of me
because in that moment is a gift and the last end of hope
Im not quite sure what you are telling me but handling work and school is certainly hard
I suppose. Training the next generation is important
Whats wrong? Did anything happen? Have you reached out to any friends lately?
Aw man Im sorry. That sounds rough. I know how you feel. Time usually helps but its pretty gradual. Hang in there.
Can we use the broken to describe our political system? 
I agree the political system we have is a mess and I think it will get worse.
Wow congratulations! Is this your first?
Wow Im sure youll be a great parent! Best of luck!
My boyfriend had issues with his foot hes even had a few hospital stays for it.
His was too. He had an ulcer that got very infected. Lost half his pinky toe.
I feel you.I had the same feeling when I first left my child on daycare 
You are gonna have to let go one day.Its gonna be hard
Im sorry to hear that is there something in particular thats bothering you the most?
I agree that tensions are higher than ever! Hopefully our country will get on the right track soon Im looking forward to voting in the primaries.
Oh no!  Why are you mad at them?
That stinks!  Try not to be jealous though.  Something else will come your way.
I bet it was.It looks like you had a panic attack.
You probably need to do some kind of therapy to supres these panic attacks.
That is horrible! Have you ever said anything to him about it?
Maybe you should mention that you just want a guys night and he would get the hint? 
That sucks. Well on the bright side at least you had a suit. Hopefully you were just a regular attendee. 
Yeah I know how that is. I bet you wont forget it next time after having to endure all that.
Oh no! You should have preordered it online!
What book was it?
Oh no! You must be quite upset about that. I am sorry to hear that.
Wow that is very unfortunate. Maybe a camera nearby was able to see them.
That is very upsetting. Everything will be okay though.
I have not seen a snake in the woods have you? That sounds frightening!
Oh I hate when that happens. Im sorry you felt that way. Did you not buy the dress?
Thats good though. Im glad you were able to find something.
oh man.Tha must have been so embarassing.
You could not read the room?? Someone was probably laughing at you.
first way to overcome it is to figure out the reason for the fear
I think you have to go for a check up first before you can conclude. It might be a harmless mole
Oh wow! That must have been frightening! That sounds like an exciting experience though.
No kidding! That will be a memory that you will be unlikely to forget!
That is something to be excited about.  How far away are you moving?
Sounds like a nice upgrade.  Do you think youll miss your old house at all?
Its okay. People are very understanding. Did you underpay? Im sure it happens all the time! 
We all have those moments! Sometimes you just have to shake it out of your mind and take a deep breath.
I did. I once won 10000 from Colgate Toothpaste.
I do use their toothpaste but it was just an instant win contest online. It was years ago. Have you ever won a cash prize?
Wow! Thats amazing!
Im sorry to hear you were feeling that way.
What types of encouragement was your friend saying to you?
Thats a cool toy you got for your nephew 
That will help him alot
yeah thats true
Thats not so bad. Everyone cheats on their diet from time to time. I would just pick up where you left off.
Well thats all the more reason that you shouldnt worry about it! You deserved to have a day off after that long!
Oh how exciting you must be proud!
Yeah my husband got a thank you like that at work recently and it made us so happy too. Congratulations!
Did you end up taking him?
Is he just naturally unruly or does he have some sort of condition?
Im aware of the terrible twos  Ive never heard of the threenager but im not surprised to hear of it
Oh man! I love Pokemon! The first one I ever played was Pokemon Blue.
Those were the good ol days. Now they have way too many Pokemon. I miss the original 151.
Thats awesome to hear! Your hard work has paid off.
You should buy yourself a nice treat once you get the promotion!
Good luck.I bet you are ready for this exam.
I am sure you are going to be a succesfull professional 
That sucks. Maybe you can find yourself a new hobby that will keep you occupied while hes gone?
Thats understandable. Id probably feel the same way in the same situation.
Oh thats awful! I invested 6000 in January and Im down to 150 now. I sold off a lot to pay bills but if I wait for it to go back up I can maybe recover 1500. 
I know I am confident it will go back so Im hanging on to this last bit. Good luck!
So you guys probably dont get along very well?
Does the wife hate you?
I dont are you waiting for one?
Nice I hope you get a nice bonus check!
Oh that sounds like fun if you are an outdoor person. Are you excited?
Well that is good how many people are you going with?
Congrats.I bet you worked hard for tha raised.
You deserve this raise and many more in the future.
Aw thats nice! I havent considered that yet as Im still quite young
I hope so one day! Its a goal of mine 
Wow that is scary. Did you guys do anything or just stay away from it?
Yes Id be very concerned about pets too.  Im glad your fiance got it before it caused anyone anymore trouble.
Oh no! What happened? I cant imagine having to go through something that scary. 
Holy moly! I am so glad you are okay. Im sure that gave you quite a fright. 
I love going to the casino! My favorite game of all time is blackjack. What are you thinking about playing?
Its swell to meet another player of the craft. Do you rake in the big bucks playing hold em?
Oh man... that would tick me off.  What did you do?
I probably would not chop his tree down.  You want to have the moral high ground.  But yes I would confront him
Sounds exciting! Are you going anywhere exotic?
Nice! I visited Spain not too long ago. I am positive you will have a blast.
Oh thats fun! I love to play video games but its usually with friends.
Anything from Mario Party to God of War. Its always fun with friends around for commentary lol
Whats your orientation?
I see there are some jerks out there in this world.
Oh my hope u are alright now. It must have been a terrible experience
Good that you finally took control of the situation
What is the subject?? The test will be oral or in writing.
If you are prepared then you will do fine.
Do you think they are messing up the country?
Yeah they feed off of his crazy I think.
Thats awesome.  How long have you been together?
Congratulations to both her and you!  Im sure shell keep doing well in her new role.
That happens sometimes.  Was it mistaken for something that might have been sitting there forever?
Im sure if you explain it to them and maybe treat them to lunch another day theyll forgive you if they havent already.
Im kinda the same way. Although I feel like if my friends truly care about me theyll find out and remember my birthday on their own. No need to go blabbing to everyone about it.
Now why would they go and do that! Well in any case what did good ole Ron get for you?
Yay! That is a difficult feat.
Mine took months to train forever. I was so happy when he finally learned.
Have you tried taking any aspirin? I feel bad for you my friend.
Yeah sometimes you have to do that to get better. I would take another dose if I were you.
Do you have any plans for it? That sounds exciting!
I would kill for two weeks of RR good for you!
Thats wonderful. Theres nothing like a bit of retail therapy to cheer you up. Now you
Sure does. I hope you continue to enjoy your new dress  you make me want to go and buy one now!
Oh I will and I know just where Ill wear it  theres a new restaurant just opened I want to try out.
Oh no! I am sorry to hear that. Is she feeling any better?
That must have been unpleasant for her. I am glad to hear that she is feeling better
I know the anciptation of giving big presentations.  Are you nervous?
I would tell you to think of everyone in their underwear but I am pretty sure that advice never works!
Holy moly thats some rough luck. Did you find the guy who did it?
Dang dude. Is your insurance company covering it at least?
I am so glad to hear that. What is the secret?
How did you meet her? Was it through an online dating service?
Get to studying! Im sure if you get in a few mores hours you will feel more confident! 
Hard work always pays off!
I have been there my friend. But the good news is if you arent typically late for your bills the utilities companies will often cut you a break.
I am positive! I have been late before for the very same reason. Dont even need to make phone calls  they just give you a small late fee and thats it. I wouldnt go making it a habit though.
How did that happen? I would be so upset.
Did Starbucks not make you a new one? I am definitely grumpy if I dont get my morning coffee! 
Oh well its still fun that you got to participate in that.
Haha thats really a cute story though.
Oh wow did anything end up happening to you? Did you get 20 years in prison?
Eh I suppose worse things could happen. Was it worth it?
Great! what kind of business?
Music therapy sounds very interesting.
That is great. Do you remember what words he had to spell?
That is a pretty tough word. I am happy your son did so great. You must have been beaming.
Thats a downer man. Who do you think was the perpetrator?
That really sucks man. Did he ever apologize to you and give the money back?
Oh no! Did he not study?
He will for sure get it next time. Im sure you scared him enough haha
I love flying!  Was it your first time on an airplane?
I prefer night flying as well.  I love how you can see the city lights moving like its the lifeblood of a living thing.
Sometimes destiny has strange ways of manifesting itself.
Try to conquer your wife again its never too late for a second chance the love of our lives makes it worth the effort.
I do as well! What do you miss most?
Theres really nothing like college parties. Those were the days.
You should confiscate his video game and teach him a lesson.
You are doing the right thing for him to learn discipline.
Oh no! Any particular reason why?
Thats horrible! But it could be many other things instead. I hope you go to the doctor
How did it go.Did you have fun?
Why is that? You dont now how to dance?
Oh no. How did you pay?
That is good. Hopefully he can pay you back.
Oh no that mustve been awful! 
Woah that sounds like a very unpleasant experience. I hope its never gonna happen to you again.
Thats a bummer. What happened once you moved there?
Its good to hear that your experience was fulfilling. I hope I can have a similar once someday.
That would be tough! Have you tried switching to cash envelopes?
Where you just use cash and put money in an envelope when its gone its gone nothing left to spend.
and what happened? 
Yeah I always get a little anxious when you get pulled in for those meetings.    Is it going to be champagne or chewing
it sucks when you cant depend on coworkers
well i hope some better people get hired
Oh wow I have done that before as well. You may have to deal with some indigestion.
Oh boy you have need to invest in some Depends.
Oh no you must have been quite upset. What did you do?
Thats great. I was worried that you had to go hungry.
Maybe it was a thunderstorm forming??
It souds like a storm forming.I have experience with thunderstorms.
Really? What did your boss do that made you so mad?
Oh that is a real bummer. Your boss should appreciate you for giving good ideas.
That is great news!  What does he play?
Is there a big baseball following in Alaska?
Those were the days my friend. What kind of car did you have?
Ford makes some pretty nifty cars! I have a Ford Focus myself. Not much but it has killer gas mileage.
OMG i dont think i could eat that many burgers in a week if I tried. What was bothering you so much that it lead to you eating so many burgers?
Im sorry you felt that way I hope you start feeling better. Maybe go for a walk and get some fresh air.
Thats sad I wonder why the dog cant find a home!
Maybe the poor dog doesnt get along with other dogs.
Oh no I am so sorry to hear that. That must be so hard. How have you been coping?
Oh wow that is so sad. Have you contacted an attorney?
What haha thats a real thing???
Wow thats cool well good job winning!
Oh geez that sounds pretty embarrassing. Did any of the bottles break?
Thats a shame. If they did you couldve reversed the situation and summoned everybody over to throw down and have a supremo wine fest.
You should feel bad for just cursing at a lady.
Did you at least apologized?
That must be a great feeling!  Good for you!  You should be proud that things are going well and not take it for granted.
Good deal!  I am happy to help!
Yes I am as well. Do you have any investments that could be affected?
I understand that but do you have a personal investment portfolio that will be directly affected?
Oh wow do they taste good?
Are they expensive or did you just find them in the wild?
Sure go ahead. Is it an important one?
Thats great. Have yo sent it yet? Congratulations by the way. Wish you good luck !
OK sure. Go ahead
Oh wow! that sounds like fun. What was your favorite part of the visit?
I love Thai food what a treat! I am glad that you had such a wonderful time.
Aww did you find a lot?
I love finding old videos too!
Yeah it sure is. Especially when you are streaming or talking to someone in the moment.
Completely frustrating. I usually end up calling customer service and complaining until its fixed if it happens repeatedly. 
did your daughters team win?
Lol that must have been a very proud moment for you as a parent
Oh no that is terrible. Are you guys still talking now?
Well that is not good. What did she do that was so bad?
I would be scared too but Im happy it turned out well.
That is the best feeling.
Oh no that is too bad. I am sorry for your unneeded expenditures.
That is a good attitude to have. I am proud of your maturity.
Yeah kids get crazy when they are bored.  Get them to read a book!
You might need to lay down the law and ground them!
How kind of him! I bet that is going to help you out a lot!
Dads are the best what would we do without them?
Wow how amazing! You must be so excited. 
Wow enjoy it you deserve it!
Omg you should have killed it
I think you should fumigate your home
Have you been able to get over your fear?
That is good to hear. You might consider joining some groups. Toastmasters might be a good one to look into.
Was your aunt nice to you?
Sometimes it is difficult to talk to relatives. Take a deep breath and treat her like a long time friend.  
Oh no I hate when that happens.  People always feel a need to look and it causes the other lanes to be at a standstill as well.  How long did you have to wait?
Adding time to your commute from work to home is the worst.  I mean youve put in a full day you just want to get home!
So the pup is healthy and  situated now?
Im sorry to hear that RIP doggo.   I have a rescue thats middle aged now. 
How exciting! Has it been a long time since youve seen her?
Im jealous! Thats so sweet and I hope you have a great time!
Oh no! What did you do?
how about a hobble down the isle? Im sure it will still be just as beautiful walking down the isle or not. 
That would be difficult so glad you survived.
Hopefully you have a strong family support.
maybe it was best to avoid drama at work
not getting your coworker in trouble and causing a conflict
Has your boyfriend ever cheated on you?
I agree. Trust is the basis for any good relationship.
How did that go?
The cigarette break is not a good sign at all.
This is so good well done
How long have you been on this?
I think there are a lot more choices now than there was years ago
I still remember the old tube tvs
That is nice. Where are you going?
That is a good idea.
I am sure he will!
No no reason to he will do it.
Thats awesome.  Good parenting pays off.
always a plus.  That makes things easier
Nice how excited are you for it?
Id be that excited too I love to fish.
You are a hard working person you will be fine
Like they say hardwork never killed anyone
Oh my god thats crazy Im sorry to hear that.
I hope nothing like that ever happens again.
What type of review are you looking for?
Oh that would be nerve wracking! Good Luck!
Im sorry to hear that Ive felt similar before.
Did they every tell you why they left without you?
Im so sorry to hear that. I lost my cat recently too. 
Thats a great name.  My cats name was Midnight. I had him it seemed forever. How long did you have yours
oh wow really? You shouldnt be! You should be excited
did they go okay? Are you anxious about tomorrow then?
Im sorry to hear that. Ive lost both of mine I know how you feel.
The downward spiral is neveer pleasent to see.
Oh wow! I never got a car for mine! Did you take good care of it?
Oh no! A lot of kids that age seem to do that with cars they get yet parents keep buying them new.
Oh no why is that?
What instruments do your daughters play?
Hi friend how are you?
Not yet I think you should talk to me about it.
To feel joy is the maximum whatever the cause I think it is a beautiful emotion.
Feel joy and feel peace are the best combination of emotions to be happy in life.
Good for you. what makes you so happy?
Good point. Any example to share?
Oh wow I am so sorry to hear that. May I ask what happened?
Oh well Im sure she was worried but disowning you doesnt help! And now she wont know your child. Thats very sad. 
Im sure it was hard but worth it!
Thats great I hope you get it!
I bet that was an awkward conversation. Did you feel embarassed?
Well that is good she prepared you most parents just avoid the topic.
Ive heard its quite dangerous are you scared?
I bet its going to be hard to fit in culturally are you religious?
Yea somethings are just worth trying to see how theyd go. You made it through welldone
Yes teachers do alot and they deserve credit
Wow thats so fun youre lucky to have many people who care about you.
I hope you had fun.
That is so thoughtful!
I can only imagine with the stress of a new baby.
What kind of jacket did they steal from you?
Sorry to hear that did you eventually get it back or no?
you shouldnt have been playing in the kitchen
Thats great. Its been a hot summer. I hope you have fun.
Everybody likes beach trips.
Finding things to be grateful for have saved my sanity
What is your favorite part about each day?
Oh I dont know. Probably happy hour.
that is her maternal instinct
no i dont think it is
Oh no that is terrible. What did you take?
Oh boy were you just trying to borrow it? I bet he was real disappointed.
Wow the zoo sounds like an amazing time. Lol the diaper thing happens.
Whew good thing for those back up diapers. Glad you guys had fun.
Wow that sounds amazing. I would have died and gone to heaven if I had gotten one.
I cried jumped and screamed... when I got my first student loan bill! Congrats on the good work though!
what subject is it in?
i hope you perform well on your exam
Well he could bring something home. Dont feel bad.
Dont feel too guilty. You can have that for dinner tomorrow night. Get pizza tonight.
Oh my gosh how horrible! I hope she will be okay.
You are a nice friend shes lucky to have you.
Dang. That is annoying
You must have informed them abou this
I bet that was really cool! Did you play with them for a little? Youre never to old to play with toys
Thats awesome! Old toys are the best toys
Thats great. How long have you been apart for?
Do you have some fun activities planned?
oh wow! Ive always wanted to do that. Youre quite brave
Its good to have someone with you who knows what theyre doing though. That certainly helps!
That is awesome! Why were you nervous?
I am so happy everything went well for you.
Wow.  That is a sight to wake up to.  What did you do?
I can imagine.  I would be burning that sheet set
Oh my god! Did it try to bite you?
That must have been a shock. I hope you took it outside after that.
What kind of task was it?
and well how did it go after all your research?
I bet youre so happy! I would be! 
who doesnt  what are you planning to do?
Omg I am so sorry to hear that.  Are you feeling at peace at all now? 
That is a long time so I am sure its been very hard. Im really sorry but I hope soon you can find peace. 
Thats terrible and frustrating because you cant really do anything about it.
HAHA best to find another job first. At least employment is looking pretty good these days.
Oh man that sounds awful. I thought the 7 hour drives we did with 3 of us were awful.
Thats rough. I feel for you! But as you said its over so life goes on 
Thats pretty amazing. I have tried juggling 3 small objects before and felt like it was impossible. 
I can understand that. After my failed attempt my oldest son then 13 came in the room juggling successfully a few minutes later. He watched a youtube video and learned in about 15 minutes...
Im sorry to hear that.  What do they get treatment for?
Im sure thats really tough.  I hope he appreciates all that youre doing for him and Im sure itll work out 
Thats nice must have saved you a lot of time.
Its election day here that may be the cause of it.
I wish I got that many days off.  The good old days of childhood.
Wait until summer comes youll be ready for them to go back to school after a month.
oh i love perfume whats it smell like? 
Oh for sure and its honestly insane to spend too much on a perfume! Call me cheap lol 
Great attitude! Yes whatever you put your mind too and work hard at will happen!
Youre so welcome! Good luck and I hope its a great place with a good paycheck!
Its always good to see family! What concert was it?
Oh cool! What kind of music does he play?
I am so happy for you and the dog
I am sure she will be okay
Have you asked the teacher for any sort of help?
I think you should try to find different ways to go about the problem. Im not great at math either but I think you could find some online forums willing to help you.
Are spending too much on unnecessary things?
Do you have any concrete financial plan on full repayment of your debts?
Congrats to your father! At what age did he get to finally relax!?
Good for him! He sounds like an awesome guy. 
That is nice. Are you excited
It should be a easy process
Oh great! Is it a college and what are you studying?
Oh man! I bet you are! Just remember to be confident in yourself and youll do fine! Dont let trolls to you either
Oh I know how that feels. You can start over tomorrow though.
I hate those cravings. I need to start doing better too.
Thats awesome! I love swimming. Are you going to the pool or the beach?
I love going to the pool. I hope you have a great time!
OH no. I really dislike theives.
Do you have insurance?
You should think about that for all of your stuff got situations like this.
Leaving you? why?
OK now I understand
we are too hard on ourselves! we really shouldnt care what others think but i would have felt the same 
im the same! give people a look when they look at you maybe some crazy eyes! lol 
Oh geez! That would suck! I hope it wasnt a cold day? Could you drive home and get new clothes?
Oh I have numbness in my hands so I am always spilling things so dont feel too bad! I understand though. As you can see I dont like having stuff on my clothes either lol
Wow! How old is he?
Amazing! Congratulations. When so many children have issues it is always great to see one that is healthy and well.
That sounds awful. Mine used to have a bad group of friends too at one point so I know how it feels. Sometimes you just want to yell grow up!!!
Yes!!! I cannot even express to you how much I agree!! My mom used to say you are who you hang out with and its one of the most true things I have ever been told by anyone!! 
Thats awful. It sounds like a freak accident. What happend?
Wow I am sorry to hear. I had a friend with an aneurysm pass suddenly about 2 years ago. It was hard and I cant imagine how you feel with it being your father. 
Why were you nervous
I do love a good sour
I can imagine she and the school appreciate that
That was a very nice gesture
We all get nervous about changing our surroundings
I have seen them
I am not sure I believe them most of the time though
Wow. Thats pretty cool.
I would have been too. No one has ever bought me a car.
I am sorry how old was it
That is a lot of memories
What was your excuse?
Wow that is pretty bad.  At least it was a cousin and not a sibling.
Sounds like hes getting the hang of it thats good.
Maybe I should of did the same for mines to late now.
Thank you Ill do that.
yes I do. Do you?
Is that a good or a bad thing?
Sticky paper is so gross. have you every used cloves? You can put the in your windows to keep flies out.
I donr know. Once I found out about cloves that worked fr me. Maybe you should het an exterminator although that seems extreme.
Probablt. Im sorry I couldnt help you. 
Okay How come?
That sounds great! I should look in too them more.
Thats pretty awesome! College or highschool testt?
Nice! Science is fun but for some reason the tests can be very hard!
I am sure no one noticed
I do get that way too sometimes
So you did get it?
Well good for you. Is it everything you wanted I once had a job turn out to be the worst.
I do not yet
I bet that was scary at the time
New people make me so nervous.
I have never tried one of those. Did it help?
Well thats pretty cool. You should own the joint by now.
Oh yeah? I bet that was exciting for both of you. Open house at their school?
I had an experience similar to that as well. Their teachers look like they should still be in High School. But they are so eager to do well I get excited with my kids for the school year.
Definatly. I would not want to do that job with such alful pay unless I loved the work. Wouldnt be fair to anyone involved.
I love going to the thrift stores as well! What did you by
tell me about it!! I bought so many brand new shirts in a thrift store last year and they still look awesome because the quality was so great
having a few good friends or even one is better then having a bunch of fake ones. It is hard to make friends as an adult that are true friends even if you are great at it! So dont feel bad
I understand! I used to be the social butterfly but now after a lot of trauma I am very anxious as well and I dont care to have people I dont trust around me anyhow. Maybe try meetups or forums where people have the same interests?
What does he do that scares you?
He may just be on a different time schedule than you. My neighbor does something similar he mows his lawn at 3am
Thats kind of odd. Is he old?
Wow. That must be nice.
Good for you! I have never gotten a promotion before.

Yes but isnt innocence a beautiful thing.
Me too. I hope you have nice memories.
Well thats good. Some people arent so lucky
thats not good  i hope you dont drive under influence anymore you couldve gotten into an accident
Oh that sound alful! Some people have zero respect for others belonging and even less for things we all need to share.
It is sad. Espically since if the same people acted like they cared and wanted to they could help make the enviroment better for everyone. 
Oh! I LOVE the sound of rain I could just sit in the warm rain too! 
It does just bring about a great feeling doesnt it?
Oh thank goodness! If I may ask what was he in the hospital for?

I am not sure that is a good question
What did they want?
Well it was fortunate that you got it back ok.
Did something bad happen?
That is true. It is sad.
Ive heard of that is it any good?
Ive found a lot of BBC shows are really good because they dont try to drag them out really far.
Wow that is crazy sometimes not so uncommon depending on your area sadly! 
Yes it is very disgusting I just dont understand why it takes some people so long to get their act together!

That doesnt sound so hard to fix
What was his excuse?
Ouch thats pretty bad.  Did he apologize?
Thats very vague did you like the shows? Or the program itself?
Thats so cool! I liked the shows on that channel as well.
Doesnt that cost a lot?
They do always have snacks.
Oh! Do you feel scared at all and will miss her?
Do they have cameras there so you can watch her during the day?
I will look into that thank you so much thats kind of you! Any special diet or fitness online you are following? I know you can do this. 
I recently read about fasting myself! I tried it for a whole few days and of course stopped. I wish I had your determination! I wish you a lot of luck.  
I have a few friends doing keto and you seem to really like it so I am going to give it a go! Ill try your advice. thank you! 
Aw poor kitty! Well that is their fault for sure. Have you spoke to them about it? Also you can get these spray things that keep cast out of your yard They spray them with water when they cross a barrier
Oh man! Well some owners suck! I would definitely look in to the water sprayers. Is the cat fixed? 
You should make it a weekend project
you will get it done i believe in you
That is so beautiful! Are you going to do it every year now and make it tradition? 
Right! Thats what I am thinking too... so cool when communities come together like that. 
Wow havent people heard of knocking once and waiting? That sounds worrisome.
Was he a salesman?
so you got a lemon ? check your state laws
Things like this happen all the time
Oh man! I so understand that! Did you have to eat ramen and 1 meals? I did! It was awful! I am so glad you are in a better place now
Oh yes I have been there to! Some food pantries are amazing but some have just crappy sugary foods. 
What did he do? 
Oh neighborhood lol I thought it said neighbor for a second! Why wasnt it safe? 
Typos happen to the best of us right! Im glad the summer was atleast nice for them and that the bad people left! 
Ill be the judge of that
Thats nothing. As long as you still get her a phone. I wouldnt be mad
Well give her the new phone and then you get one later. Happy wife happy life
Oh I hear you! It
Sorry! Its so nice when you can afford nice stuff! I feel you there. I do not have a TV I watch everything on the computer lol! As I am on it all the time
how long was it out for
i hear you 
Thats very kind of you.  Did she feel better after?
Thats good to hear.  Do parents often view the daycare cameras?
Oh man! I am so sorry! You must be devastated.
Oh man..I just had someone go through that. It is horrifying. Yes a long battle can be good or bad. I am sorry.
I bet that was a nice surprise
That is always a nice surprise
What does the teacher say happened?
Oh thats rough. 
Sometimes depending on who they are.
Thats so nice. Im happy for you.
Are you gonna see each other again soon?
a hurricane ?
we have a hurricane kit  emergency essential kit always . 
they are good to have . always to be prepared .
a good phone is something everyone must have 
youre the first person i know that has an xperia
I feel the same! I hate apple products. I refuse to use them
I didnt know that. Another reason to not like them
I am sure you will do great. What kind of biology is it?
You just need to know that the mitochondria is the powerhouse.
Yeah I could never do bio it was too much memorization. I like physics more which is why Im in engineering.
what type of math is it?
Oh my god! That is so sad! I am so sorry!
That is a good way of looking at things.
Some people are just so careless... I am sure your mom was keeping a good eye on the child. shame on the parent tho. 
I know its a pain in the rear to lug them around but you have to. I lug mine around like a kangaroo with her kid in her pouch. 
Thats the worst.. expectations can make and break us. I hope the next time around you get it! 
that is a good outlook to have
That is a great. I hope it was a good offer
Oh that sounds convenient
That is so true. 
I am thankful for every day I get to spend with my children. 
That makes me sad too. I wish there was more I could do to help out.
Thats a good idea!
It feels good when your on top of things.
Well Im sure they will benefit greatly from all the preparation. They should be proud to have a mom who cares as much as you.
Oh thats wonderful! how long have your parents been together?
Oh geez lol. Do you not like to cook? Congratulate your parents for me. Its great to find someone you love and then also to have it last so long!
Ive seen that before. It is sad.
I do too. Everyone deserves to have someone in their corner.
Oh thats a bummer! Do you go to college locally?
Oh great! I am not a big fan of college anyway. Maybe you will find a new love while they are away 
I dont think anything is worse than dealing with a period as a teenager!
I miss being so carefree and having the whole world at my fingertips!
Awesome! History is HARD! I always had a hard time remembering the dates and times especially.
Amazing! What was your final grade?
Its nice that you care so much about them
They are that
Thats unfortunate. How many animals did you have?
What kind of animals were they?
ugh.. for the better or worst? How are you feeling? 
If you are feeling that way then it probably is! On to a fresh start. 
Me either. It is going to be interesting.
Two daughters and one son
Hope youve got a lot of storage room. We try to do that too.
how old are they ?
Wow mothers have the best instincts when it comes to their children.
Exactly take care of her. She is a treasure.
Youre very lucky! A lot of people cant say that these days.
I wish I could do that.
That is so sad!  I would be so mad at the drunk driver!  How could he live with himself!
I agree!  There is no excuse for that to have happened!  Such a tragedy!
Why did they do that?
Oh shoot. Did you forget to pay?
I am sure that was embarrassing. Just a mistake. 
Thats pretty cool. Did they win any games in the tournament?
Well thats amazing!
Who did they win it over?
Did you pass?
That is great good job.
That is disappointing. What will you do now?
I dont blame you.
THat is great.  SHe will have fun participating in spelling bees
That is outstanding!
what scared you
oh man how did you get it out
Thats wonderful. I feel the same about my daughters.
10 and 13 now but it never changes.
That sucks. I hope you had insurance.
Well he was the one that caused it so thats what he gets.
Im sorry you must miss them a lot if you dont see them as much as you used to.
He is a jerk.
Dont forgive him or your friend. Find new people 
Why have you wanted every career instead of focusing on just one?
I think you could still find one if you wanted too.
That sucks.  Have you investigated her
Sucks Ive had to work under scumbag managment before
Thats awesome! What have you been doing to reach it? 
ugh sounds like work...... but you did it! 
Im 50 and havent rode one since I was 2.
Dont have anywhere I need to go.
I can relate to that. 
That will be nice.  Having a side gig really helps a lot as long as it doesnt take too much time
Nice!  What was it for?
Awesome!  What do you do at your job?
Im sure you will be vindicated.
whoops lots of people have done that. whatd she say?
hopefully you were able to work it out...if not...in the future dont tell girlfriends about exes.
And did you?
That does sound awful!  The thought of being out in the middle of the ocean makes me nervous 
I agree.  Dont let it stop  from taking a nice getaway though
That sounds really annoying!  You should confront him and request he stop.
That would make me really angry.  Call a tow truck to teach him a lesson.
Why didnt you want to notify or leave some sort of little note on the car? 
happens sometimes just dont know what to do in those moments. 
That seems like itd be strange.
well you could always have left.
Do they play any instruments?
Thats cool can they sing too?
I hate when that happens did you have to put all your stuff back?
Well it happens to everyone at least once probably so no worries.
happens all the time in the city i live in people are rude! 
yup! no reason to stoop to their level. you did right 
I hope you didnt use any.
Was the soup good at least?
What did you say?
What did you do instead?
That would freak me out.  What was it form?
Oh Wow!  Did he get caught?
What were you on edge about?
What movie did she see?
Sorry to hear that. Whats wrong?
I know that feeling it will get better. Just gotta stay positive
Ha that sounds comical.
You could just think that maybe you were alone.
That was pretty crappy. What did you do instead.
thats really crappy.    Youre racking up the bad karma.
Thats got to be frustrating for you.
Have you tried asking for a raise yourself?
I have felt that way sometimes too
I am trying to teach that to my children. They are stubborn
What are you going to do about it? 
Get some hot shots raid spray it shoots like 20 to 30 feet in the air! I sprayed all the way from the ground to the top of my roof. Spray and run. lol! 
It is great to appreciate the things that we often take for granted
That is true. It makes some of our trivial problems seem so insignificant
Thats never good. What was it?
At least it wasnt a stranger trying to break in!
Oh jeez!! Noooo... I hate them. They are evil and so mean. They literally come right at you for no reason. 
I cant handle any type of insect. I had a giant black one fly into my apartment today when I opened the door so I feel you. 
Haha is she going with you?
Definitely take her with you! She will love it as much as you
What was the award?
Dang that sucks. Did you get 2nd place?
I like to tan in the sun.
Yes I always use sun screen.
No idea what was it?
I love having a clean home and warm food! No better feeling. Did your husband do this for u?
Never heard of it but you better believe i will be googling. 
deff jumping on the internet now to read into it i do like spiderman! 
Oh no what did you do ?
how long did you have to stay that way.
What prompted that?
I can understand that.  Reflecting on different times
Me too. We just need to keep at it and not give up.
Im not even looking for anything serious like marriage just a friend that I can relate to romantically.
I used to have the DVD but I sold all of the to upgrade to Bluray. I havent seen that in forever
The ast spiderman movie was really good. Did you see it?
Whats going on on Friday? 
Oh awesome! I love taking vacations. Where are you going? 
What! You still got your discount tho right? So you get to use them over again!? 
thats righty! you better go buy a lotto ticket because you are deff lucky 
That sucks I love my mom so much I cant imagine her being dead...
I will def do that I need to be more grateful for while she is alive. Thank you for that
Thats what family is for!
Why do you hate your parents?
great I hope it works out for you.
whats your preferred field?
Yes kids are a blessing.
Enjoy it because they grow up so fast.
That is so cool!  How old is your dog?
That is exciting!
Wow she is talented. Is programming difficult?
Oh I thought you meant like computer programming. You must be so proud
Driving in the city is challenging I hope she does ok!
Theres also a lot of one ways in the city too. Shes going to get used to it it should be fine
I hear it is harder the second time around to get into shape but you sound motivated! 
Really? Thats good to know because I had no idea. I wish you a lot of luck in regaining your muscles back! 
I know that feeling but I crashed my car my dad bought for me like 1 year later. But that feeling of happiness was awesome!
A bad and good experience haha. Drive safely unlike me
Sounds like an amazing day honestly... i hope tomorrow goes the same for you. 
Oh yeah and I hate to admit it but if it doesnt go as planned I do let it ruin my day. 
What did you get started doing?
Oh no!  I would be too
how old is he?
I hope he was okay.
You have to do what you have to do. Did anyone walk out and see you? lol 
atleast they didnt see you! 
wow i am impressed
what are your long term goals 
Its always a pain waiting to hear back from a bank.  I always think somethings gonna go wrong.
Im sure everything will work out fine 
Is that to become a bartender?
Are you nervous?
Was it good?
Did you return the movie?
Wow they dont sound like good friends to me. 
You should give them the cold shoulder next time you see them. Thats what I would do.
Nice! I bet you feel like a weight was lifted off your shoulders!
What is your side gig if you dont mind me asking?
There is a lot of buzz for that is there?
THat sounds cool.  What format do you play that on?
I dont watch a lot of baseball but was it an important game?
Well Im sorry to hear that. Maybe they will reschedule it for a later date?
I do not have a car either.
I will never buy a car again.
i know that feeling congraz
your first home ?
Sounds like it was worth the ticket what kind of caR? 
deff worth it! 
I bet youre relieved!  Good friends are like that though especially if they know youre struggling. 
Maybe when you pay him back you can get him a little something extra to show your appreciation.
Oh no haha were you prepared for it?
Nice good job!
Waiting always kills me! How much longer do you have to wait? 
I am sending you good vibes and luck! 
Oh no thats never good. Is he doing fine now
its a part of life you know
i remeber that day
that is outstanding!
Right.  Hopefully that will motivate her to keep up the good work!
Just tell her? She will be grateful for the honesty.
Dang thats rough. I wouldnt know what to do either. Its like you choose to be a good friend and destroy their marriage or let her get married so shes happy. Goodl uck
Did you jump out or did you brave the war and kill it!?
Im sure!!! I had a gecko come in my house today and it was adorable yet i was still super scared to touch it. 
I feel the same way. I have social anxiety so standing in front of a crowd is pretty terrifying. 
Oh man! Just stay confident! You have to keep the negative thoughts in the back of your mind.
Yikes I hope you have insurance.
Dont worry man youll be fine. Everyone makes mistakes
Thats good everything is so close. It really helps out a lot and walking is good for you! 
You and I both! 
Resist the temptation!
Food is the worst too because all that junk food is all around us.
I love those moments where you get to see all the hard work get payed off! How did she do?
I bet you are so proud of her!
Oh no!  I bet you regretted that fast!
That sounds bad. It was probably harder to get off too
How long are we talking about ?
Sounds like you know what to do.
It should be getting better now that summer is over. Good luck
Its hard to admit when we are wrong. DO you think you will fess up?
I understand that
I believe in you! Where are you planning on going?
I was thinking a cruise sounds perfect for you and your kids!
Have you called her back since then?
Im sorry sometimes people even family can be difficult. you cant be all things to all people. give yourself a break on this.
You guys sound like a strong family!
Sorry to hear that maybe one day you entire family can get along
I feel the same way.  I dont trust people are paying attention
That is my biggest fear too
I hope it was a mistake?
That was crazy!  I agree
Soccer is a fun sport to play. It would be good for you to do something you love also
Was it their fault?
Been there done that lol.
What type of dog is she?
Havent heard of that one before.
Whoa that sucks. You need to get away from them asap.
Ive only been to a couple of minor leagure games in the city.
Thats pretty cool.
I have never had any. Is it similar to eating crawfish?
Sometimes you just have to indulge and then do better next time.
I am with you right now! However tracking carbs accurately in an app has been a gamechanger this week
You will be so shocked at how well it works I promise.  You dont want to go over. 
Thats awesome! How old is your cousins?
I hope you guys have a lot of fun! I think Im going to meet my cousin in New Jersey on the 9th? Its so nice seeing famiy members after a long time.
Oh no. Did you get it back?
Thats such a shame. It really makes you lose your trust in people.
Its such a terrible situation. You just never know what circumstances have brought someone to where they are.
I know what you mean. 
That sucks have you tried calling the bank to let them know about the mistake?
Did you get your money back?
What do you do in the summer?
I love going to concerts.
Who isnt? I am scared of death because I dont know what will happen afterwards. I fear the unknown.
I am also I love football.
I only watch football on Sundays.
Prom sounds exciting.  Do you have a date?
Nice! That sounds so fun.  Are you taking her to dinner first?
Music can do that to you sometimes. I listen to mine regularly.
I would agree with that 100
I know right. If you invade my personal space prepare for backlash.
I hate that so much people need to learn manners.
Oh my gosh!  I would be mortified!  Did your face turn red?
Wow!  That had to be so embarrassing!  I would probably quit my job!
What all do you have stored so far?
Do you also have a gobag?
Yes I do not like that either.
Never I am a nice guy.
Me too it throws my frequency off. 
I think noise reduction headphones would be perfect for you try Bose or something.
What kind of work did you do?
I guess you got a lot accomplished then. Do you work a regular job too?
Bummer. I enjoyed summer so much.
But at least Christmas is around the corner. I love Christmas just as much as the summer!
You can do it
Im working on my debt too.
That would be a great time.  What did you do?
I bet.  I would be too
I bet you were. That is a great accomplishment! 
Are you you guys going to celebrate?
Like years. I use emails a lot but I dont feel the need to use actual paper letters. Its 2018!
I know right. That kind of stuff is very nostalgic
It seems like an almost unachievable goal especially at my age.
50 yeah but Its just not the same.
That sounds fun.  What kind?
Those are really cool looking
That must have been nervewracking?
Sounds like you have a very responsible young lady growing up.
Me too I feel you bro. Its ok at least make sure you are being productive.
Try joining clubs or finding hobbies? Or you can always make friends on online video games!
Sounds gross lol
Omg. You should take your dog to an obedience school.
Those are always so much fun. Catching up with old friends.
Thats great. I have one coming up. I hope it turns out as good as your went.
That is disappointing.  Is there other things you can apply for?
Any other promotions where you are currently
Congrats! You must be excited to start your career.
Im glad you stayed the course. There are a lot of big opportunities in store for you.
Oh right.  I havnt heard of it.  Are you playing?
Oh no what happened? Everything ok?
Maybe you can bring it to the tire place. Maybe they can patch it real quick.
Oh no I hate that feeling.  Is it better now?
That is no good
Wow great  are you happy with your purchase?
Congratulation! i hope you enjoy it.
Was it a good deal?
Excellent that it was a great value 
Thats cool what was the interview about?
Local or national?
are you making good money though ?
well in that case way to go
That is great.  Well done!
I know that for sure.  I am working that myself.
I hope you guys enjoy your visit! Are you guys really close?
Aww I bet you miss her a lot. Well its good you get to see her soon!
You must have felt nostalgic of the old days.
I understand it is usually hard moving to a new city leaving some many people and placed behind
What position was that?
Oh wow I bet you were ready for that. Were you already working there?
That is great! I bet it feels good.
It sure is and it gives you something to be proud of.
Great when will you start?
Fantastic keep your spirits up and the skys the limit.
That’s great! I bet he is ecstatic!
That is definitely something to you to be proud of!
That sounds great!  How old is he?
Nice Did you do any fun activities together?

I hope everything goes well friend.
Dont worry once they administer the anesthesia you shouldnt feel a thing.
thats awful did it clean up easily?

Thats great! I hope you enjoyed the food..
Keep it that way. If too many people find out it might ruin the experience.
Nice softball is fun. I used to play baseball but always had fun playing softball in gym class
Yeah its rewarding teaching kids and helping them learn how to become functioning human beings. I have a 2 year old nephew whos nuts and asks questions all the time
That’s interesting. What did you have to do?
That sounds cool!
Thats amazing. I have only been on a few planes in my life.
I have not and will not ever.
Uh oh did you apologize to the person after they answered or did you just hang up?
Oh wow! Thats even worse than dialing a stranger. At least he didnt pick up!
That is something I need too.  How did they get new so cheap?
That sounds awesome
It is very important to stay close to family.
That is wonderful to hear.  When times are tough family is all you have in this world.
You dont get any free time?
OH. I know what you mean.
Did you like them okay?
Im sure shell have a fun year.
I do too.  I have a fantastic recipe
That is really nice!
OH that sucks.
Do you think the other person deserved it at all.
Awesome!  What will you be doing?
That is awesome. They chose you for a reason. You will do great!
Thats really bad. What is she going to do about it
Have you eaten it all yet ?
Well youve done well so far then .
I would have peed my pants.
I am sure you are good at many other things though. 
That’s ok.  If you would like to learn start simple
Im sorry for your loss. That sa to hear.
It must be really tough. It will get better.
Oh yea? What was the bet?
Everyones got that low minimum wage job at one point in their life sometimes.
Take a power nap.
They really do recharger you.
That’s no good. How did she do that?
That explains it!
Did everything go okay?
Your friend probably understands if you couldnt make it.
lol cmon man show some class.
I understand sometimes you just gotta let a bomb drop.
Did it escape your house?
Have you put out signs? contacted the animal shelter?
Smores are a must when camping.
I dont know. They probably brought their cell phones
i have never been so lucky.
Ive found a couple of dollars and lighters in the washing machine. Thats about it lol
Allergic to onions? I have never heard of anyone with that allergy. Must be tough 
I hate onions I just dont like the texture of them
I would love to do that. Did it cost him much?
Well he sure did save a lot in labor costs.
Hoping the beta was okay.
Oh wow. A fish freezing in the sun? Or was it winter and sunny?
Like beige and brown?
That would be nice but its highly unlikely.
It sure was.
That sounds familiar.  Is there someone she can get it from?
That’s a relief.  
What did you yell at her for?
Oh that is sad I hope she knows mistakes happen!
Mario is such a classic. Havent played smash since gamecube I think.
Which character is your favorite?
Why dont ou call her?
Well send it to her with a note to say you miss her. She can call you if she has time.
Oh. Who did you vote for?
Wow. What does she do that peole would vote for her every year?
I have never tried and never will lol
Thats what I think. Plus Id miss bacon too much.
You must be his role model! Thats awesome.
Thats just funny! Well Im glad to hear shes learning and improving! Good to start them young.
Why did she send you a shipment anyways? 
Appreciate them while they are with you and try not to worry.
Its unfortunately. If only we can all go together and not leave anyone behind.
Well you seem to have done a great job parenting!
That is awesome that is hard to come by
Do you guys still spend the holidays together?
Oh no. Im sorry to hear that.
Oh no! Is what you have in there worth more than 500?
I know but if there is nothing valuable in there just forget about it.
I hate bullying. You should talk to the kiids parents.
Beat the kids up. Thats what I would do.
Theres still another month of summer left where I am.
I feel the same way. Everyone isnt as fortunate to have family.
I learned a long time ago how important family is and now I have my own.
What show is that?
I did not know it was ending sorry to hear that!
What are your goals?
Ah I see. Its always nice to have a goal to work towards.
Are you keeping them?
Thats a lot to take in.
Oh. How was it different to the previous ones?
Yea. Didnt warrant a new version hu?
I am sorry to hear that why are you working extra?

That is terrible I hope you feel better!
Yeah I hope so!
What dog breed is it?
Oh wow that is an energetic dog good luck!
It sucks but sometimes you just cant compare yourself to other people.
Yea I get you. Its hard not to feel bad when someone seems to have it easier.
Thats tough its good he has a friend like you to help him out though.
Its good you have a close friend to count on too if needed.
Thats good to have reliable friends.
How many years now?
I think a lot of us have been afraid of the dark.
Im glad youre not afraid of it anymore though!
Where are you going?
Ah that should be fun probably nice this time of year!
Why arent you anymore? 
What were you most afraid of at night?
That is amazing! Im happy to hear that. I can relate I feel like I have undiagnosed ADD.
I have a very hard time focusing on what Im reading so it can definitely slow down the learning process.
I can relate to that! Its so mortifying because everyone begins to look at you like youre a bad parent!
Thats usually the main culprit of those situations!
Id probably stay loyal too after weighing the pros and cons making a list for myself.
good for you wish i could say the same for myself. Im not unhappy just got more work to do.
Wow. Sounds like crazy stuff I wouldnt want to get involved in.
Sounds like youre a lot more mature about it.
I have not played it. Are you going to go back to the last and quit playing it?
Yes I agree. Id give it a week.
Thats good. I hate that your having difficulties. 
Yeah its tough. But we just got to keep working.
Im so sorry. I know the feeling Im really sorry!
Yes I grew up with him and he got me through my parents splitting up and everything. cause I didnt have many friends. I know everyone always says dont get another one too soon but for both my cats that passed and my dog doing that really is what got me out of the rut. 
Oh man. At least youve got some other assignments to bring that back up.
Im surprised school started alraedy.

i hope everything goes well !
Families are really precious.
Yea. So many people take their loved ones for granted.
That is very sweet of them!
It sounds like it people can be so sweet
Thats really sweet I think most people feel the same way as you. Families are really important.
I dont know what I would do without mine!

I am sorry why did you break up?
That is not fun sorry to hear that...

Its good that hes there for her.
How did you do that?
That will do it sorry to hear that!
Did that make you feel embarassed?
How old were you when you overcame it?
Why are you so tired?
What is your job?
People come into our lives for a reason sometimes.
Im glad they were for positive reasons for you.
Im not much for eating out I heard Chipotle is good though.
Well Im glad some people can enjoy it at least.
Oh nice. What instrument did they play?
Thats pretty amazing!
How did that happen?
That is very sweet of them do not take them for granted!
Yep. You just said that.
Do you have a guess?
I do too that would not be good
Thats awesome. How did you guys meet?
Oh man. Seems like if you didnt meet your sweetheart in school its more difficult to find a girlfriend.
Thats exciting what are you doing there?
Watch out for any spooky politicians haha.
Oh man must make you feel bad.
Its better not to compare your situation to others sometimes.
That is a lot of food hope you can eat all
That makes sense hope you enjoy it!
shes a lucky girl.
Not a lot of guys say nice things about their girlfriends behind their back haha!
Thats nice to hear. How did you guys meet?
You guys still in college?
That is a lot I hope he does!
I believe you that would be hard to get around a lot of money
Wow have you tried calling it?
That is not good where could you have left it?
They must have really been there for you.
haha most of the time.
Thats a lot of money how did it go?
That seems unlucky. Was it your first time in the stock market?
Oh wow. So who was the fairy?
Shes an awesome lady. Youre one lucky person.
were they expensive shoes?
What shoes were they?
When did you meet them?
Nice. How long have you all been together?
Ah well did you like the other person?
Why were you afraid?
I see. I think I used to be afraid because I cuoldnt see anything.
How was that? Must have been a throwback!
I am sorry to hear that hope you get some more?
Super Smash Bros is a classic!
How many people do you usually play with?
What is it called?
Oh why did it go out of business?
I hope you get the job!
Good how big is your family?
How about your immediate family?
Was the nightlight in your room?
Youre okay with it now?
i like alone time
i think its good to find a healthy balance between being alone and being social
That is super unfortunate did you manage to save any of the fries by chance? 
Im glad that you did not lose all of them it would be terrible if you did all that work for nothing!
Why not? You only live once get out. Make the most out of every day!
Sorry to hear that. How did you meet your lady friend?
i bet that was fun were you nervous?
it was probably really exciting though too
A little bump in a relationship should not affect it that is good. Always love and take care of her.
A key to a long relationship is persistence so keep at it! 
Oh no!  Was he OK?  I hope there was no permanent damage!
That had to be really scary for you.  I bet you will never make that mistake again!
Wow I could never do that I really hate heights.
Youre pretty brave for conquering that fear.
That is bad. What happened?
Wow. Did you call the police?
Yeah it sucks. I have noticed it too.
I know and it is really sad.
You really got lucky that day.
Be sure to play the lottery.It looks like you are on fire.
Im sorry to hear that. Is there anyone around in your life?
Thats horrible! I hope youre trying to do some fun things to take your mind off the pain.
How happy you must be!
will he go to college?
Aww how nice of him! I bet you were happy
How long had it been since you had seen him?
Oh I hate when I see that happen.
Sometimes I think parents need a training class.
That sounds troubling. How did your visit go?
Well that sounds like it worked out fairly well fortunatley.
Oh I hope you do get the job! What is it?
Well good luck that sounds like a challenging role!
What are you going to do there?
Are you going with anyone?
Oh wow thats horrible. Was the kid ok?
Haha. You already gave him a whole cake. Did he need more dessert?
Sounds exciting! Whats it about?
Sounds like a really heartwarming story. Hope you have fun!
Do you like her too?
Give it a go. You might be soulmates.
Were the lines long?
I agree. More people should get involved to make a change.
You will find the right one someday.
Oh how come?
No ones perfect. Maybe youll see her next time.
I am so sorry to hear that.
It must be devastating for her. Do you think shell be able to overcome the loss?
Your friend must be superman! or woman Lol
Yes he does. He deserves it I hope he is going to the college that he wants to go to all that hard work should pay off for him!
Thats always disappointing. What were you wanting to buy?
Thats too bad.
Thats pretty cool. What are you going to do?
Oh wow bungee jumping is a huge step!
Wow Im surprised. Didnt know they were that generous.
Oh ok. I was thinking it was New York where the cabbies are notorious for being rude.
Thats awesome you must have done something right to make a kid so bright.
Thats the way to do it clearly.
It could be something good maybe.
I can only imagine how frustrating that is thats why I work at home full time.
Im glad you got through it.
Hows life now?
How old is he? Is he excited? 
You will grow to love it. Football is amazing sport. Your son will love it. 
Just wait a few years. If he sticks with it he will be at practice 6 months a year then playing games in the snow.
Oh wow. How do you feel about that?
People get lucky sometimes. Its better not to compare yourself to someone else.
Are you anxious about it?
Sometimes people are not thoughtful of other peoples time.
Yay! Congratulations! Have you been saving for awhile?
Thats so exciting! Best of luck with your new computer!
Oh god. I hate that. What did you do?
Im sorry that happened. How much did it cost to repair?
Pajamas are comfortable. No shame in that.
For wearing pajamas?
Oh wow! You mustve been hungry.
Will you be able to eat all that? 
Some organizations are really life savers.
Not like mine then. So many fronting to donate but theyre actually stealing.
Im sorry to hear that but he is lucky to have you.
Yes you are Im sorry to hear about you losing them.
Sorry to hear that the trouble of going to the doctor just to confirm its strep throat is the worst. Its like I know I have it just help me!
Hopefully you can avoid that the swab to the back of your throat is a gross feeling!
Oh no! maybe she needs a break for a wahile
Thats no good. I guess youll have to find a nicer game.
Oh thats curious... By different what do you mean? Did you buy different stuff or go to a different store or what?
Oh yeah totally. And then you dont end up buying too much or too little and you dont waste time trying to remember things. Theres also tons of little apps on your phone you can get that can make it really streamlined and convenient.
Im sorry to hear that. Maybe give it one more try and if you continue to like it that might be your sign to stick with it. Good luck!
Oh my gosh thats so annoying! How did you deal with it?
That was a good solution! Smart thinking!
Well thats good are you enjoying the new stove?
Wow how kind.
It is always a bummer when you borrow something and it breaks right away. You feel responsible and have to replace it. 
Did you end up buying him a new one?
Were they related?
Thats terrible to be yelling at a kid who probably doesnt know any better.
I hope she is okay also.
You should go with her next time so that doesnt happen.
I hope hes okay. I hate when my dog is sick.
What is the dogs name? Ill say a puppy prayer for him
Must make you feel jealous.
Maybe they dont even have enough for the cars themselves.
That is weird.  Do you know what happened?
That is creepy.  
Wow that would be a really awesome thing to discover! Did you use it for something fun?
That is fun for everyone. Especially if youve been having hot sunny weather.
You guys sound really happy together.
Thats wonderful. How long have you been together?
Wow that sounds so scary!
You must be pretty strong to do that.
Well thats awfully generous of them. 
Wow are they a very close friend?
Thats awful. Im so sorry you had to experience that.
Guess shes estranged for a reason.
Nice. When was the last you have seen them?
Why you didnt contact them?
Will you explain it to them?
Thats understandable. Hopefully you wont make the same mistake next time.
Yikes. Did she have to walk?
Look at the bright side. She got some exercise. We all need more exercise.
Im so sorry to hear that. What did you guys find?
You two must miss a lot.
Good for you. I loved spending time with my grandma!
She is the sweetest woman I have ever met
That sounds crazy!
What happened next?
Nice. Did you preorder?
Sounds like its gonna be a lot of fun.
I know where this is going lol
You obviously werent alone
That should be fun.  Does he live pretty far away?
That has to be tough
Oh no. Did you need it?
Sometimes we forget stuff. It happens.
You could have still eaten it if you were daring.
Bright side it would have been a great excuse to order pizza. 
A complete stranger? How the heck did that happen? Im sure you must be confident that its safe if theyre staying with you.
So are they trying to apply for jobs and stuff? How long do you think youll let them stay for?
I think were just another number for them.
Im actually doing one now. Need better pay. I wish us both the best of luck.
Oh no! Which author is it? That really stinks when you cant finish a story. An eternal cliffhanger.
Thats a good idea. I know everyone is worried about that when it comes to George RR Martin and game of thrones.
Wow. He didnt get you one hu? Thanks Dad.
Thats nice of you. I hope he feels better soon.
Its great that your kids are having such a great relationship with their grandparents.
Yea they do but theyre getting old. Makes me scared.
That is a long time.  What are you going to do?
That is  good.  Might be a good time to work on you
Thats insanely gross.
He will be single forever.
That is a great thought! What makes you so sure?
I completely know the feeling. My kids are teenagers and I threaten them every day that I will move in with them when I am old and grey lol.
If only that actually worked right? lol
Ugh that would freak me out! Did you ever find out if it was a real bat?
Oh well thats lucky for you haha my three sons hate bugs!
Why is it so shocking?
Well she is married right? some people say sister in law before its official
That sounds really good.  What kind do you like?
That sounds great
Oh. Whats happening tomorrow?
I hope youre able to tough it out.
That is amazing did it lower your insurance rates too?
That is a bummer but congratulations on the highest score that is something to be proud of. 
Oh no! That sounds awful. Were you able to stop on the way home?
Oh goodness! I am so sorry that happened to you! 
That sounds wonderful. 
Does he have a sister? lol
Holy cow thats impressive. I bet they had to be carried back home. Did they even break a sweat?
Haha thats so funny. I bet it was even funnier to watch. I can kind of understand itpho is really popular. Ive had it and its not bad. My girlfriend loves it and has it like once a week along with spring rolls.
Oh god Ive been through that. At least a bike is easy to clean?
Oh man. Sorry that happened.
Make that wish when you blow out the candles
Birthday wishes come true. You will have to work at it still though.
aw how old are they now?
You definitely need to teach them not to do that.
What time is it there?
Well they should prbabl shut it down soon. It is only Thursday.
Oh no how come?
Well he sounds like he really loves you.
Hes definitely going to learn a lot. How long will he be away for?
Will you miss him?
Did he take good care of your car?
Thats great! Not too many 16 year olds are that responsible.
Thats awesome. Did you get nervous prior? 
It gets easier as you get older. Im sure you did great.
Thats sad. If you cant trust your family how can you trust. Are you going to say something?
I dont know. If you let it go it could happen again and again.
Those were the days. I remember buying 25 cents popsicles.
yep. Those popsicles are like 13 dollars now
What is it?  am curious.
Oh yes and remember Bagel Bites!
Stop making me miss my childhood!
Wide open? Or just unlocked? Thats crazy! I guess you got lucky you didnt get robbed or have some animals become new roommates. Hard to believe decades ago people loved to go to bed with their doors unlocked.
Uh oh! Thats scary. I bet you wont let that happen again. Well Im glad everything ended up okay.
That is really a shame.  Too bad they wont get help for the kids
You would think they would be motivated to keep their kids
That is so disappointing. Will you stay there?
Thats too bad. Maybe explore some other options and see how you feel.
Thats really nice! What does he usually get at the store?
Sounds a lot like me. I love going through the toys and gadgets section to see if I can find anything for my kids.
I love a good surprise party.
I never get gifts or a party. I need new friends and family
That really stinks. What game did she used to play?
Yup. Because as soon as you give him a sweet stack of cash hes probably going to blow it at the slots. 
I disagree with both Democrats and Republicans.
I am having a similar issue.  You shouldn’t have to pay for a service they aren’t providing. 
That just isn’t right!
Shopping is fun!  What do you plan on getting?
Hopefully you will catch those great deals!  Sounds exciting!
Thats awesome. high school?
I bet you are so proud. I cried when my daughter graduated 6th grade lol
In terms of grades or something else?
Oh I see now. Wow that is pretty lucky!
Thats awesome that you devoted time to care for him!  How is he doing?
Thats great you got him up to a healthy weight!  Kudos on you!  Im sure those spots will even out eventually.
Oh thats cool having a nice new car always feel so sleek and cool.
Ah! Thats always such a scary thing because theres such a dreaded anticipation that goes along with it a whole Will it? Wont it? kind of game of seeing whether it will head in your direction. I live in the southeast so Ive dealt with worrying about plenty of them.
Yeah theres always that fury of activity by everyone to go stock up on gas groceries and other materials like batteries etc. So did it ultimately end up hitting you or no?
I really hope he gets accepted!
You sound like an amazing father.  He is so lucky!
Ive never watched it but ive heard its really good. Maybe I should give it a try
Really? I will definitely give it a try. My favorite tv show is stranger things
I know the feeling.
Nice! What do you plan to do with a house empty of kids?
I am glad for you. Sometimes kids can be annoying.
Stressful. Was your work understanding? Is he ok?
Is he feeling better?
Like the creamsicles?
You wouldnt believe. Im eating one right now.
Me too. They wer 50 cent on the ice cream truck.
Thats cool. I buy the box of six and dont share with anyone
Why would you think that?
Why would you think they are jerks?
You must have lived there for a long time.
I am so sorry to hear that.  It will get better.
That seems pretty gross especially the possums.
Nice and congrats! How long have you been together?
Thats really nice. Been thinking about proposing to my girlfriend as well. Weve been together for almost the same amount of time.
Im sorry who is going in too 8th grade?
Oh awesome! Oh my gosh they do. I cant believe mine are in their 20s now! I hate it when they grow up honestly
Holy cow thats amazing!  Good on you!  How much weight have you lost?
Yeah I can relate.  I bet you feel and look amazing!  That determination is a quality to behold.  Keep working hard!
Where were you?
Did you forget your lines?
Oh thats terrible. 
I always hide my sweet whenever I buy any
Hmmm sounds like an unpleasant job. Maybe they ask you for help because youre the only one around? It doesnt hurt to help those in need.
That is a fair point. You cant have those that are there to protect us be distracted. This is a key tenant when Im on watch in the Navy.
oh man im glad you didnt get into an accident though. please be careful next time. did he give you a ticket?
At least he didnt take your drivers license and tow your car
They did!  That is so terrible!
Im sorry maybe they will get back together.
That is cool did you film it?
That is awesome is this your first kid.
Thats typically a nerve wracking experience. Did you meet any kind people?
Yeah if it is a bad neighborhood I suppose.
PHysics? Im glad I never took that class.
Are you looking for a career that involves physics?
What is your degree in?
Wow impressive. What do you want to do?
Oh Im so sorry to hear that.
Well thats one nice thing to enjoy. Thats sweet.
I bet you did great!
But that is still okay. Either way you accomplished something difficult!
Thats the best part of the day
The first sip of a beer is pretty nice too lol
Have you met them yet?
That might be a bad sign
Cant you see the driver on the app?
Did you get a refund?
Just eat a sandwich.
Wow thats odd. At least you will save some money.
What is her style?
Lol have fun
Wow that will surely be a rewarding career. I am impressed that you want to help others.
Yeah I felt bad luckily he forgave me though.
Im sorry to hear that. Were all human and that does happen sometimes. I guess all you can do is do your best to not say or do anything you cant take back. Is everything resolved now?
Ah an argument with your spouse? Those are always tricky. I hope you guys can work through it amicably because thats obviously an important relationship.
Wow. How old is she now?
how old is the valentine
Thats sweet though
Why did you ask for onions then?
Oh I was confused.
Well did you get your money back?
It will get better. I know that is a tough thing.
Oh yeah? What kind of car?
Hey at least it is still a car dont feel bad.
Oh I know what you mean! Its so weird because for that first month or so you like dont even fit in..
I hope you eventually made friends! I know how much it stinks to feel left out of everything
I do hate flooding as well
Thank goodness nothing flooded then
You can lose weight too.
Have you tried?
Did you love it? That was sweet
Maybe she should take some art courses.
Maybe not lol
Thats no good. Are you going to report him to the police?
Yeah mentally ill people shouldnt even be allowed to have dogs. There should be a screening process.
Oh my lord! How are you still alive?
Be careful! You can puncture your stomach like that and not make it. It happens to those with bulemia all the time. Stay safe!
How do you think you did once you took the test?
I am sure you knocked that test out of the park  sweat or not.
Awesome!  Happy Birthday.  What are you going to do?
That sounds like a great plan!
Im sorry. I bet you you miss her. That is so hard.
That sounds like a really good idea to do. 
Thats a good thing.
Thats really good. What class is it?
Psychology made me sleepy lol
Did you move to the country?
Well you have to be safe
Then you definitely have to be dafe
Of course lol
Some people are less fortunate
Well you should cherish them and let them know how you feel.
oh no what did you do
wow you are a brave soul
They might win the east
They should be pretty good
Congrats for your brother! When is the wedding?
Fall is a wonderful time to have it. Are you going to be the best man?
Staying in is good sometimes
Netflix is always nice
Well thats nice. What are you going to do?
Thats pretty cool. I dont see my friends much since I moved.
That is commendable.  I try to
I absolutely agree
I would be far more surprised if you did.
Thats just stastics.
was everyone ok?
In a cool antique way or a disgusting way?
That is so gross. Did you complain to them?
Is it getting boring?
What do you do?
thats the worst!
yea thats rude
Ooo! What kind was it?
Oh! Great choice for the environment. Are you going to save up?
what are you gonna do? partyyyyy?
I know what you mean. Thats no fun.
Do you have any hobbies or do you like to read?
Im sure it will be helpful
Bigger vehicles are so convenient for stuff like that!
Yes it seems like that was just a couple of months ago.
Before we know it we will be voting for president again.
That is a horrible feeling I know but you can start over again the next day.
Dont be too hard on yourself. Allow yourself to indulge every so often.
What did you do while they are gone?
Aww.  Why?  Did something happen?
Yikes.  How are you today?  
That was nice of her.
Do you stay in touch?
Weekdays always seem to pass so slowly but weekends fly by not even noticing them
Do you have any plans for this upcoming weekend?
Nice! Do you see yourself marrying her?
I hope everything turns out good for you two!
Thats cool. I dont watch too much. Are you a fan?
Are the cowboys your favorite team? I prefer watching college. 
Wich one?? My favorite was the shining 
Yes that one is very scary
I am too things are going great.
Im glad youre being enthusiastic.
What did you lie about?
I assume you were trying to be a good friend and protect them?
Where did you go after you left?
Nice what SUV?
I need to google that. Is it a big SUV?
My sons are always talking about the new video games coming out. What game are you waiting on?
I have never heard of that game. I bet it will be fun though.
What kind of paintings does she do?
Wow does she sell them anywhere?
Thats not a reason to dislike someone.
Yeah I do to. Does he plan on losing weight?
You like Donald Trump?
Me too hes so real. He loves what I love. MMA poker guns WWE hahahah
Yes but do you drive safe?
True but the odds are slim.
Im sorry that you feel lonely.
Absolutely never be a victim.
happy birthday! What year is it?
Time flies fast! Make sure to do what you love and be with who you love
Oh I bet she will love that. How old is she?
Dont let the secret slip!
I am sure it was welldeserved.
Oh man I am so sorry! I have lost many this year too. I hope he had a long life
Oh man! What happened?
I sorry that you have to deal with that.
Yeah you need to get of there quickly.
Why?  Previous bad experienec?
True.  Its always good to go outside with a friend.  And dont forget your towel!
I wish that was not the case I would have came.
I hope you have much brighter days moving forward.
Oh wow! I would have been scared to let mine do such a thing.
Thats good to hear. She must have a lot of your trust sounds like a bright young lady!
Is that relaxing to you or lonely? 
Try to enjoy the quiet but not get down.
Im sorry to hear that did you lose your job?
I hope things work out for you.
Didnt you check your bought items more thoroughly before putting them in a bag
Seems some irresponsible employee of theirs miscategorized the items when putting them in those shelves
Thats too bad. I hope everyone remained respectful. Seems like everyone is being kind of childish about politics lately and getting mean fast instead of keeping it decent.
I am seeing a lot of nastiness. Yes just remember everyone can agree to disagree and be ok. I hope everything is ok!
How exciting! I am jealous!
That sounds very fun. I might have to take you up on that offer. I have a good friend that just moved there.
Do you trust them to be home alone?  I bet youre scared huh?
Thats good.  Youre a good parent!  Good luck with everything!
I hope you guys are always safe!
I wish I was a good driver!
That sounds fun! 
I bet place that is so big you cant go through it all in one day
Thats no good. Did you study?
I understand that. That just means you have to excel at the rest of your assignments so you have a chance to average it out!
That is so sad. I am sorry.
Thats a very nice way to think of it.
Oh how exciting!  What is it?
Awesome!  Im sure you will do amazingly.  Keep your head up!  Fake it til you  make it LOL
Aww that is so sweet.
You are lucky to still have that.
Wow have you gone for a ride in it?
Thats so cool maybe one day you can save enough for you rown.
Oh is the new extra space a good thing?
I can imagine that being a bit lonely.
I know how that feels. It is horrible!
That is good to hear that it doesnt happen anymore.
sorry to hear that. What happened
sorry i hope they apologized for that
sorry about that did you try checking on another store?
am sorry maybe you should wait until they are restocked
Im sorry did everything get resolved?
Im glad everything worked out.
 Oh my gosh seriously???
I am so sorry ab out that I hope things get better soon
That is so annoying. Maybe youd have to get a chart to keep track.
That is too bad. I am sorry you have to deal with that.
Congratulations! You must be so proud.
Wow it sounds like he has life all planned out.
Oh yeah do you love basketball a lot?
Well I hope you enjoy it!
Did everything turn out okay?
We all have our moments.
Thats horrible. Must have been annoying huh?
Wow thats very fortunate. Mothers are great.
Thats great! Whats going on?
Thats nice that you have a friend like that.
Wow that sounds like a very busy household. How are you able to manage them all?
A nanny is a good idea. Would you consider using contraceptives? 
If you dont like such movies you should have told him at the beginning so he choose  a non scary one
Its ok though at least now you know that scary movies are not your kind of movies
Ouch! I know that hurts been there too. Does it feel better now?
Yes it makes you want to say more than darn thats for sure!
Why did you go to the movies by yourself?
That is great being so independent.
Ooh did you pick your own numbers?
Thats awesome! I hope you win!
was it a young kid? sad nonetheless
Oh thats great! I tend to follow some missing children stories closely but I hate when theres a sad outcome
Ooh how fun you must have many adventures planned.
Well I hope it is super awesome!
Im sorry to hear that do you know any way to help yourself calm down?
Well you could also try praying! 
Wow thats fantastic!
You are very lucky to have such a smart boy!
Holy heck are you okay? Was it like a fender bender or a full on collision? 
Freaking idiots on the road. Is your insurance going to be able to cover the damage?
Oh that sucks! I can barely do 5 without needing a break
Thats quite unfortunate. I feel for you as I used to live in a small town where jobs were scarce. Its rough when there is no competition
Oh thats never fun. I hate that too.
That is so cool you are moving into the job market. Yay!
I trust you did well too
How does it make you feel when you think about them?
Aww I am sorry to hear that. I hope you can regain contact with them someday. Im sure theyd love to hear from you.
Oh maybe you should try joining  achurch.
those were the good times now kids just want to be on their phones
I used to love riding my bike around the block
Oh no thats terrible. Can it be replaced?
What kind was it?
Thats sweet of her! You should put them all together in a nice photo album.
That is very kind. Im honestly doubt that my grandma even knows what a printer is.
sorry to hear that. Sometimes there can be a technical  problem
sorry about that seems their customer service is not welcoming
Some people think they know all the answers. Its sad as they usually dont grow as much as people
I hope he does for his sake. But I imagine he will come around
If you report him to his wife the shame will make him pay you back
Then talk to someone that he respects maybe they will talk senses into his head
Its a chance to turn a new leaf by  getting a high score even without cheating
Thats good. The first step towards turning new is to resolve and take action. 
Good for you! Stealing from anyone is a really bad offence. 
Having proof is awesome otherwise it would make your case a hard one to prove.
Wow I would have been upset! How did you react?
Are they going to pay you back for it?
Wow you must have done lots of reading then? i dont get As all the time
thats great. They now have confidence in you
No. I hope it was a pleasant day for you and not sad
If you know where youre going then you should be
That is very nice
Did they brought any special gift?
That is terrible! Why did you blame him?
Im glad you understand that now.
Oh lol Im sure it was embarrassing but its happened to most so understandable. 
Im sure Id be the same way too!
Are you stoked about something good?
Thats great!  Where are you headed for your vacation?
Do you have anything you want to see there?
I feel the same as long as I am treated with respect
That is interesting
I have felt like that as well 
I think the reason is because we want to know if they would fit or not or if we made a mistake or not thats how it is when its not bought from a physical store
Wow. You must be very proud
I wonder if he was self motivated
Awh that really bites. Its the worst when it feels like everyone is having fun without you.
Thats right! It will all pay off for you in a few years.
What is it about them that you dont like so much?
Ah yes I know that feeling. Sitting in traffic is a major drag. I find that music or podcasts help it go by quicker
Aww!  Tell me about it will you?  
You should go to reddit.comreyebleach.  Theres nothing there but cute and nice things to look at.  It will ease your soul.
Thats very unfortunate. That cashier needs to find a job they actually like doing.
Theyre supposed to either do that for you or get someone else to 
I understand. It is difficult to have everyone staring at you
Thats great! I dont know too many people who look forward to that. You must love your job
Great! I wish I loved my job and work environment as much as you do
I feel the same about my dog. They really are like family members.
I will just think they are happily watching down over us and try to go on one day at a time.
Oh really?!  Tell me about it Im excited to hear!
Oh that is freaking awesome!  Congrats!  How are you going to treat yourself??
You must be a very special person to her. Is she single? 
Too bad oh well if things turn around in her status you have someone in her that you can consider
Oh no! I hope you can make it! 
Whoa thats quite a walk! I hope that doesnt happen. Do you have anyone to call for help?
Oh no what happened? 
Who can blame you? We are taught to trust professionals.
Oh excellent.  What is your dream car?
Are you buying it outright?
What color are you shooting for?
That is a great accomplishment!
Congratulations Im sure it will be a good PC.
Good memories I take it? I loved not having to make it myself
Aw well thats good that it did. Im sure she wanted it to be!
Was she a bad employee?
Then what caused you to fire her?
sorry about that you could have called a friend
yah or get a comedy or get to watch a movie
Yeah I remember those days too!  What was your favorite gift from a family member?
Go Grandma!  What an awesome gift.  I bet you were stoked! D
Excellent!  Those thoughts are beautiful.  Have a good day 
How exciting! Do you know what your destination will be?
Nice! It will be a good time to relax and enjoy the beach and nightlife!
Oh I know that feeling! I only just got my first decent smartphone this past year!
Its definitely different than what I was used to. Its crazy how fast technology upgrades. Sometimes I feel like a caveman.
I am sure you will find a great girl soon!
Just be patient and everything will fall into place.
Oh no! I hope it goes well as Ive heard those can be tricky procedures
Youll be fine! Having hope is the best you can do
Really? It is a fine movie
Ok. I understand
Oh my god. What did you do?
Thats great I hope you werent hurt!
Oh thats terrible.  Did he say how he lost it?
Do you remember the title?  Maybe you can get another copy.
How was that for you? Are you close?
Ill bet. Its always nice to see someone who can bring back good memories.
Why? Was it because you didnt take those last few moments to spend time with her? Sometimes we have so much going on we dont have time to do it all!
Oh no Im sorry to hear that. You had no idea that would be the last visit but I can understand how you would feel that way. I have no doubt she understood why you didnt though.
Ooh thats cool! What did you have in mind? 
Thats a good idea. What restaurant were you thinkin? 
Thats awesome. What kind of job?
Youll do great! Thats right up your alley.
Ive never been in one but I always assumed they were cleaner!
Ew thats gross. Some people have no sense of decency. 
Oh really?  Whats the good news?
Thats great!  What finally convinved the boss?
Its good to get noticed for that.  most of the time you only get attenton for messing up!
What model or brand of laptop were you considering?
Nice! So youve had a good experience with that brand?
Thats fantastic! Congratulations! Is it at a restaurant or home prepared?
That sounds awesome honestly. I hope you enjoy it!
Aww thats too bad.  What was the cause?
Thats pretty rough.  Were her last years happy at least?
Im sorry you feel that way. If you feel that you do good honest work you should demand better pay!
If its a personal matter I would definitely take the issue over to human resources. Its better to stand up for yourself.
How long has he been a swimmer?
As you should be. I wish I liked to swim.
Oh my gosh thats such a heavy thing to think about. Did you ask her or confront her?
Well I hope theyve figured it out together during this time. 
That sounds like a wonderful surprise. Was it something that you had seen before?
Are you going to wear it or put it up for safe keeping?
Those tests can be stressful. How did you do?
Awesome! Congratulations! It is always nice to accomplish something like that.
Sorry to hear that. How that happened?
I understand. Those thing happened from time to time.
Thats so nice! What did you get her?
Wow that is really thoughtful.
Ouch thats rough. Maybe she just isnt ready. 
Do you have any proof? If so you should bring it up to her.
oh you mean not having enough to pay your rent?
I am sure there is a special friend that can help you with that amount and when you have you can repay them back
Oh no! Are you thinking about buying another one?
The meaningfulness is definitely something you can never replace. I hope that it shows up and if not I hope this watch brings meaning to your life in new ways.
Wow thats... odd.  Was it for a cake?
Hahaha Sorry I just assumed you were 5 years old or something.  Yeah getting practical gifts is more appealing as one gets older.
What kind of things did you get?
These days that is a great gift am I right?
If it wasnt your fault then what caused you to lose?
Multiplayer games can be fun but thats certainly a downfall to them!
Oh my. How did that happen?
I see. Well its an honest mistake. Ive done different socks before
You will be fine just get a new one
I understand how you feel I used to have one like that when It passed away I got a puppy of the same exact breed and gave it the same name. with a few month It looked like the one that passed away so It helped me to forget 
Really? did you use marijuana ?
Wow I bet thats exciting but also makes you a bit nervous. Congratulations though Im sure you are proud to do it!
Well I would probably feel the same way but Im sure you will be great. If they didnt have confidence in your abilities they wouldnt have chosen you to do it!
Oh no! I hope you were able to get over the disagreement.
Customer service is very important and it seems like that place needs to work on that.
Whats wrong with your sight?
Thats good a speed recovery I must say.I commend the opticians
Well if the milleage is not too much and the car is clean go for it
I think in situations like this you can take someone that knows about cars along
Congratulations! That is such a big step in life.
What is his name?
Whats got you feeling down?
How inconvenient! Are you going to take it to a technician?
What was she doing?
There is a lot of that type of behavior now. Its like people have lost their minds.
Thats awesome. What did you end up getting?
I love chocolate cake! Youll have to save me some.
That can be sad but luckily you can plan to visit them in the future.
Yes using social media really helps us connect with friends and family so much better.
Oh yea Ive had it happen a few times. Its even worse when they lose the package for a while
I dont blame you. I try to keep tabs on them because I dont trust they will be delivered in time. I also set up a camera to catch deliveries that dont deliver 
Congratulations! Im sure its well deserved!
How are you going to celebrate?
I hate having car troubles! What is it this time?
My sister is recently going through the exact same thing. It was frustrating for her for a while but things are looking up for her! Im sure they will for you as well.
Oh yeah? What about?
Oh no that is sad news indeed. I am sorry to hear that.
Thats a shame. Is there someone else who can go with you? Im available. LOL
Im sure she really wanted to go. Sometimes we have to make choices we dont like. My offer still stands. 
What was your experience like?
I love looking at old photos both happy and sad moments.
Me too! What did yours look like? 
Wow that mustve been really spoooky.

That was very sweet and thoughtful too. Glad youre better!
Wow thats a long time! Kudos to you. Its hard for me to imagine being in one place for that long
Yea benefits and pay seem to be the common motivators. Im glad it worked out so well for you!
You will be alright its always like that 
Think about the positive aspects of this you are moving forward
Really? What sort of things have you done that make you feel that way?
That sucks hopefully nothing you cant replace. Id suggest getting some help if your drinking has become distructive.

Wow thats a food challenge type of thing! Did they get anything out of it?
Thats great! What was it about?
Im glad you really enjoyed it!
Good for you. Dont live with regrets. Learn from mistakes and move on.
Thats a weird term to use
Why? Did something bad happen to you?
Well Im glad no one was hurt at least. 
Thats cool! Has it been a good transition?
It can be stressful sometimes. I am glad to hear you found something good.
Thats sweet.  How long have they been married?
Yes it is.. thats great that their love has lasted so long.
Thats good! You should always encourage your childrens talents and let them grow

Luckily it will heal soon and you can feel back to normal.

Oh no! Was it traumatic?
Thats nuts! I would have been so scared
The little ones always feel so fragile what did you do?
Little ones love rockers or swings did you have a good time watching your cousin?
What grade did he get? He doesnt have to get an A in everything.
Thats quite harsh for getting one bad grade. You should encourage him to do well without being so rash.
I am sorry to hear that You can take it again though and try to get a better grade!
Oh that is not good. You should have done better!
Well good thing is you realized your mistakes 
You should get your mind ready for the worst if he does not take it too well
Thats always a good thing.  Did you give them a fun reward?
Thats so cool..  I live in Orlando.. Ill wave to you guys!

Oh thats too bad.  Well then I hope you can find happiness again in the future.  Good luck to you!

That would be pretty shocking overall! I hope youre able to move on from this somehow.

You must felt really lonely because you need friends in college
I bet it can. I had no friends in college either.
Congrats. I hope youll like what youre doing
Thats like the toughest job out there.
Uh oh! So what happened? Did you end up passing it?
Thats great. Good for you bud.
Where did you land in then? India or something?
Aw well that seems like it would be a great time! I hear the beaches are beautiful.
Oh my goodness! Why did you do that?
You should tell your wife to clear your guilt.
oh my god!. I hope he loves her as much as you do
Did she know that  you crushed on him?
Oh that sounds kind of worrisome.
well thats a relief.
Did he? Where do you both go to school?
I bet it was college is such a great time.
Wow that sounds pretty stressful. How do you think you did?
As long as you did your best I say have no regrets. You made the most of a bad situation.
Thats great! Im happy for you. Will you be getting a raise?
Ill cross my fingers alongside you. It sounds like you deserve it!
Oh that must have been awkward.  Did you two talk to each other?
Im sorry to hear that.  I hope you dont dwell on it too much and can be happy in the future.
Wow where did you do that?
Thats awesome! I really want to go paragliding someday.
Oh my what did you do?
Its okay hopefully it was not too expensive1
Thats a very exciting time in life. Do you have any preference for gender?
Ive heard that as well. Im male I know I was much closer to my mom.
He will turn out to be a great man
Oof i know how that can feel.
yea that would help clear you concision 
ok how did you manage the situation?
I think you should have talked to the hostel management to help you out on this as well
That has got to be hard on the poor guy. Did you offer any help?
I see. Well hes probably still there.
Oh wow! Thats horrible! Did it fall down the drain?
Well hopefully she should be able to forgive you. It was an accident.
Theyre not very good friends then. You should confront them about this.
Could be hopefully the wont dismiss you like that in the future!
Oh my I hate when that happens. It makes me so angry.
I would be too some people shouldnt be driving. 
oh yea why is that?
oh wow thats so stupid of him.
That is great did you get the license?
Well hopefully you ace it!
That sounds great! Whats your meeting about?
That sounds really interesting. Hopefully youll get rewarded for your great performance!
Oh that sucks but i think he should understand the situation.
thats unfair of him.
Oh Im sorry to hear that. Were you hurrt?
Hopefully insurance will be able to cover the car at least.
Oh wow that is an awesome car.
i can imagine you would its an awesome situation.
You shouldnt feel bad. It happens to all of us at some point.
Its okay it was just an accident.
I would be really frustrated with that as well. Did you exchange the colors?
Well it sounds like shes listening to you at least.
Congratulations. You have done well
I wish I can attend a party for this if there is
I agree these shop mechanics can be extremely knowledgeable when it comes to computers.
yea but at least now you have found a good trustworthy place.
Well that sounds like a good thing to do.
Well Im happy for you as well that your needs are being meet.
He should be understanding of that and not keep on. Thats just frustrating for everyone involved
Sounds very immature if you ask me
Omg! does the place have camera? at least so that the police can track down the person
If you have insurance I think you will be fine
oh that sucks i know how that feels its why i got an extra job online
Yea it was scary but im happy its not bad anymore.
I agree. Do you have a new car?
Oh cool. I love visiting car shows myself.
OK let me in on it
So what was the experience like ?
Why does that make you feel bad? Youre allowed to have fun sometimes.
Oh that would be tough. Have you told your partner?
You must be quite hopeful to get this new job then! I hope you do as well.
I agree but stay positive. There is nothing you can do now.
I hope I will still be helping my kids when they are grown up. I like to feel they will always need me. 
Yes but they can be a bit of a challenge when they are growing up!
You should definitley pick them up again. Dont let age stop you!
lol well as long as youre fairly active and fit it shouldnt be too big of a problem.
Why did you hesitate in the first place?
I see than I could tell you that you should just overcome yourself and do it but its you own personal business...
Wow that sounds rough! Have you told your wife about it?
I could imagine. I hope youre able to work through this somehow.
Is there still time to get one? You can if you hurry!
Hmm I think you should make it up to her somehow. Take her to an expensive dinner. 
Oh my goodness. Who is that guy?
What an impostor. 
Its a great stage in your life what is he majoring in?
Well I wish luck to both of you.
Is there anything that could spoil that?
Seems like you took all the precautions the rest is not up to you.
I hate when that happens.  Things always seem to go that way.
All you can do is just keep doing the best job you can and hopefully someone will notice someday.
Your dog doesnt keep you good company?
I guess so but it should be able to alleviate a lot of that loneliness.
Congrats. Boy or girl?
Im having a boy soon. 3 months or so
sorry to hear that. I hope he is okay now
he will be okay as long he got the tratment
Well early happy birthday. What will you do to celebrate?
Thats great. Enjoy your day.

My condolences to the owner. 
That is so aggravating! I am sorry to hear this happened to you!
Call the police! I hope you nab these guys and put them in jail!
That sounds horrible. Are you trying to motivate them?
I can understand the feeling. I always feel ignored.
Oh sorry to hear that. I was under a lot of stress. What happened to you?
Oh no sorry hope it wasnt a snake. My hound dog is alwayd barking.
Yah lost my job and trying to find a new one.
Oh my that is along time. Did you feel nostalgic? 
I see you should rekindle your friendship.
I know that feeling! Maturity I suppose
Its that feeling you have to live with for now.. Lol!
Why what did you do to feel like that?
Are you planning to make up for it?
You are so lucky to have such caring sister
I hope you can reciprocate by sending her a birthday message  when its time for it so she knows you care for her 
Im really sorry to hear that. How long did you have it for?
Thats really tough right now. I hope youre doing something fun to keep yourself occupied.
I really hope you are alright. Did they catch him?

I completely understand I have had my car broken into a few times and had objects that held value and were sentimental to me as well
Good luck! Have you studied for it? Do you feel prepared?
Dont be paranoid. That just upsets you. Try to think positivley.
That sounds aggravating. Did you say anything to her?
Thats okay you should call the police next time.
Yeah Tuesday is just the beginning of the week and more to go. Is that why?
It always feels exciting to do something big at work. It always feels good to feel like you are making progress in your career. 
Also maybe this is something you can put on your resume and it will look good in the future. 
Sorry about that. You should try again and stay confident. The most important is to try.
Good. Stay focus and you will have success. We always learn something in our good and bad experiences.
Congratulations. Are you going by yourself? 
Have fun you two!
Eww that must have so disgusting. You should report this to the FDA.

Oh Im sorry. Have you tried to talk to people?
You can try again to reach out to people. Otherwise remember that it is only temporary... soon you will be in a different class with more opportunities to make friends.  
Nice it is always to good to celebrate your birthday in a fancy way every few years!
That is quite interesting. I hope your day went very well!
That is gracious of you. I havent done that in awhile.

Thats really great that you have someone to take them out of the house and help out!
Becoming a parent is funny I used to so look forward to summers. Now even though its nice to have time with them it adds new challenges.
That is wonderful to have a personal touch for your wedding. It makes it all the more special. 
Thats great that you had a backup plan for that. It sounds like it was great and I bet everyone was very impressed!

What exactly did you do for the school year book?
That is wonderful. I use to love English classes in college.
Its great when family get together. Do you do that on special occasions only?

thats is really nice of you as a friend
she wont good deeds arent punished
You can still turn it in! Just drop it off to the police or the people in charge at the subway. 
I would feel bad to but save up some cash put it back and bring it back. you got this. 
That is nice. You dont go anymore in family?
Sorry to hear that. It is good a idea.
very true.. do you live alone now?
i feel you.. but look on the bright side it makes the moments being together far more special
oh damn.. it is kind of funny yes
lol.. i guess that would be a cool story to tell you child when she grows up huh?
I am sorry to hear that.  Do you have any meds that could help relieve the pain?
Maybe you should rethink going to the dentist if youre in so much pain.
Oh how did you like it?
Ill have to check it out thanks for the rec! Ive been meaning to add more things to my must watch list.
oh wow I really hate snakes I wouldve freaked out! What did you do?
you sure are brave! I wouldve ran.
Were you able to find it?
glad it worked out.
hrmmm wonder if its a ghost or a rodent?
oh wow.. that is strange
lol you are so lucky to have such a sweet brother. what do you buy him in return?
haha.. thats hilarious i thought he was spoiling you!
Oh no have you found him yet? 
I really hope so that sucks. Put out some dog food some water maybe one of his favorite toys. 
wow thats a nice little drive!
oh wow i would think it would take longer
awesome! how much did you get?
thats too good.. congrats!
What!? My god sounds like a horror movie. You better move. 
I would have moved that same night and probably changed my identity thats terrifying! 
Did you get there on time? I do the same thing I like to be prepared for any traffic that could pop up.
Something always comes up whenever you need to be somewhere! Thats how life works!
oh i see.. did you have any programs planned?
sorry to hear that buddy
oh no were you hurt?
true that stay safe!
Oh what kind is it?
Ive never owned a jeep are they nice?
Why not? Whats going on? 
Happens to the best of us we are only human. Dont take it in a bad way im sure its been real nice being alone. 
oh damn.. what was it?
i hope the cops took care of it
Oh god how so what happened? 
Sounds like florida ugh 
Wow you too! Its crazy how many bad drivers there are.
Well Im glad you werent hurt.
Yikes thats a tough place to be in. Shes very forward for asking something like that too.
They do and you never know what could happen lets say you guys get into a fight and then she trashes your house! Not a good outcome!
That sucks! I cant save money at all I always overspend even just for groceries. I hope you can save up atleast al ittle money and take like a daycation ! 
Im always living on a budget so even if you could atleast treat yourself for a day or 1 night then do it! You deserve it I am sure you are working hard. 
Thats pretty awesome. I have never been that far!
Mexico. I went to cozumel once
Sometimes it can be hard to find the right one at the right price did you find one?
That is awesome Im glad you were able to find one. How big is the TV?
yeah that kid were more lovely and attractive. i was love kids
oh thats nice 
Same as me! Everyone is always shocked to know that
Well truth be told Ive never gotten one ever which is even more rare. But good on your partner really. Thats hard to do!
Are you going to have any other roommate or you will be living alone?
Maybe you can post an ad on Craigslist. That way many will see and be interested 
Did the check end up hitting in time?
I would be too. ugh that sucks! 
Oh no. That has happened to me before. 
That is a long tedious process too. You have to have one thing to get the other and they make you run around and get more things. ugh
How many does she have? 
That is a lot wow she must really love watching tv atleast it gives her something to do tho! 
Thats great. You both must be excited
Are you moving to a better home?
That can be nerve wrecking. How did you do?
What kind of grade did you get?
Thats great. Do you visit the casino often?
Yeah I dont have the best luck in casinos either.
Oh dear! Did you get sprayed? That would frighten me too especially at night.
Well thats a relief! Im glad neither of you got sprayed.
oh its unfair and really hurts

Oh really? I can understand. I usually regret eating Taco Bell. Especially after the digestive process.

Thats incredible! I would have never expected him to leave Cleveland.

I would be mad too. What happened?
How long before you get what is owed to you?

Its nice to see someone who loves school! What are you studying?
Lol! Oh my goodness. So you are going to be a police officer or a lawyer?
Oh I am sorry to hear that. Are you normally frightened to go home alone?
Do you have an alarm system. My wife and I have one and it automatically texts me if I am away from home and the alarm goes off. 
That is amazing. It is so nice to have someone to share your life with. How long have yall been together?
Wow! I have been married for a little over 2 years. What is the secret to a long lasting marriage?
Oh I have felt that way before. When did you graduate?
I can totally understand that. I was so excited to get out into the real world. I did one enlistment in the military after high school and now I am in college. Rude awakening after high school!
I hear you! What happened?
Thats not good. I hope you both can communicate about it in a respectful way.

Oh thats okay! I am as well. Sometimes I trip for no reason whatsoever.
That happens to me often. I also trip walking up the stairs quite often. It can be quite embarrassing!
Me too its the only place I get to get away from my wifes constant nagging.
Its no problem. My work comforts me just like yours does.
Thats great! It is so important to be content in life.
What do you do for a living? Does that contribute to your happiness?
Oh wow! Congratulations! I also recently applied for grad school to study Computer Science seriously. What are you wanting to study?
That is very cool! I dont know about you but I have been stressed out about the whole process.
Thats great that you love your job that is really important!
That is a powerful type of position.

That is great. I love dogs. Do you have any family 
Yay! That is great. Where are you going for vacation?
Wow! Thats exciting! Was it what you were looking for?
Thats great. Congrats on your home purchase!
That is scary! Ive never flown before the only time I have ever been on a plane was when I went skydiving.
I also enjoy traveling!
did you intervene?
that is awful
That does not sound good to me either. I cannot stand pineapple!
I think it is too acidic for me.
It sounds like you have a fulfilling job. Thats great
Its so refreshing to hear someone who really loves what they do.
i am really happy for you
Thats awesome! What is the name of the book?
Thats great. I produce audio and I have an album coming out by the end of the summer! Tell her to keep it up!
Oh wow! That must be quite nervewracking although I am sure that you will do great! What are you planning to study?
Oh wow! Do you want to work in schools?
It is eerie isnt it. You must have felt quite strange. Hope your poor doggie is ok!
That mustve been terrifying for you. Its amazing how we can hear every little thing around us when were alone!
Thats great! You must feel so accomplished! What math class are you taking?
I can understand that! Math has never been my strongest subject. 
that is great! family is the best
i can imagine
That was so nice of him. He sounds very caring.
You are very lucky!
I am sure you will get used to them
That is a challenge but thats not a bad thing
Oh man I am so sorry.  Had she had the dog for a long time?
That is so sad.  My dog had congestive heart failure and died so I know how sad that can be
Although you felt bad I am sure your friend would understand. 
That is good. Everyone gets busy sometimes.
That does sound fun
I am sure there will be none of those there
I am so sorry to hear that. Dealing with the loss of a loved one is always difficult but feeling alone in the grief must be so much worse. I hope that you are feeling less alone now.
I am sure that it did. Were you very close with your father?
Oh YAY congrats! You should be proud of yourself thats a good accomplishment
Yeah people get comfortable even if they dont like it. Its sometimes good to try something new.
I did not understand the number 4
Well ... I hope you like it and above all that you study something amazing
Its something weve all done dont feel bad. Would he have gotten mad?
If you dont mind me asking where was it that you pretended to be?
Ya weve all been there lol. Just be careful and all that youll be fine.
Oh wow what aspect of his presidency is bothering you?
I can understand why that upsets you. Are you a Hillary Clinton supporter?
Did you study hard for it?
Thats awesome! Are you going to celebrate now or wait until the grades come in?
yes it its.Its like a time machine.
I am sorry what are you sad about
I have been there. I guess just remember the good times
Thats awesome! Congratulations! Are you in college?
That is a wonderful memory. What school did you attend?
Thats great! Are you in school or teaching?
Thats awesome! I am currently in college myself. I actually just finished two summer courses today. Not going to lie though I could use a bit of a break before the fall semester begins.
Oh wow! I am sure that you did great! Did you just finish high school?
I can relate to that. I went into the military after high school and I am currently in college. It was a bit overwhelming getting back into the state of mind required for school but it is all worth it! What school are you hoping to attend?
Its hard to make this decision ... Im sorry ... Whats your pets name?
Omar sure will have some new owners who will love it
Why dont you see them anymore?
Aww the best thing you can do is keep them alive through your memories.
Oh wow are you excited
I remember that feeling myself back on my first day of college
The first years is the best
Congratulations! That is exciting
but its over now  what kind of car?
thats a good car 
I bet that was pretty awkward.
Did the woman say anything to you?
Oh no what did you take?
Did you tell him about it at least?
I love surprises.  What was it?
Nice!  Where did he take you?
Oh wow! Did it work?
I bet you felt really bad. Did you end up telling her the truth?
Im sorry to hear that. Is there anyone whos there to help her?
That was nice of you.  My parents did the same with my grandparents.  Shes very fortunate to have you.
I am sorry to hear drunk people can make a situation quite difficult to deal with. Have you been friends for long?
I can understand that. You sound like a good friend.
Oh no I am so sorry to hear that. Does your mom know?
I am so sorry that your family is going through this horrible time. Is your dad unwilling to end the affair?
I can understand your apprehension. Have you ever served on jury duty before?
I have never served on jury duty either. The closest thing that I have experienced was serving as a guard during a military court martial.
What did she accomplish?
WOW... that is a biggie!
Good for you.You are a person with morals.
We all have thinking that sometimes but acting is the wrong thing to do.
Oh mine too he is 12 and lost eye sight
Wow 15 cant do nothing but love them
were you qualified ?
its all apart of life sometimes
That was really lucky! And also very nice of your sister. Whatd you do with the case?
Thats really great. Are the trees really tall where you live?
Thats terrible! Did he at least live a good life?
Oh man! Be sure to give em a proper sendoff. 
I dont think having designer brand is all that great.
Why does being cool matter though? Wouldnt you rather just be yourself?
Oh yeah.. what happened?
That is the worst.. Ive had that happen to me before!
It is nice to have your own place. Think about just being able to do whatever you want. You can just punch your walls if you want.
Its ok just think about it this way. You dont have to pay property taxes or even be worried about your lawn.
do you live in the midwest
do you have an emergency shelter in your basement ?
I hate that did you ask them to stop
That isnt good sorry
Thats fantastic! Senior year can be such a fun experience! I hope that she enjoys it. Is she going to take a senior trip?
That sounds exciting! I went on my first cruise in March we had a blast!
Oh wow he must be proud of himself!
That is some feat I wish I could do that!
That would really upset me! How are you going to get to work?
Can you take an uber?
It can be scary my sisters inlaws house got struck by lightning recently.
I think so not sure how the house is.
I am sure you will be okay
I am glad it wasnt
That is tough.  Does he help you study too??
Then why do you think he gets better grades?
Did you try watching movies or playing video games?
Did you have a great Christmas then?
Holidays are always a nice time to get together. 
Sometimes being alone can be a good thing though
Well I am sure it was a good experience
Oh that is pretty neat. Who is your favorite band anyway?
Oh I like them too. I like that song I think it is called Change. It is so good.
That would be discouraging.  Did you make new friends?
Thats no fun. Hopefully you got some stuff done around the house then.
Oh no.. why what happened?
Thats awesome!  I am tired too I had to be up early today.
Oh! that is pretty nice to come home too.
You better keep him sounds like a keeper.
thats so great! i love my dad too
thats really awesome
Oh man I bet that is a very difficult test. I cant believe how many instruments are in a cockpit!
What a bummer. At least now you know what you need to study for when you take the exam again!
Thats unfortunate.  Did the people you work with by any chance surprise you?  Please say yes!
Blow out them candles and make a wish!
Congrats!  What school?
How long must you attend school?
I bet that was fun
That will be fun
That is awesome. Was it high school or college?
Oh cool I bet he had to work really hard to get his degree. I am sure he appreciated your support.
I have those kinds of feelings as well. I think memories are a good thing though
I can understand that for sure just remember the good ones
That sounds really nice!  Did you enjoy yourself and relax?
It is a good feeling when you get to just relax and feel laid back.
Ha that will be fun though
Ha I bet it will be fine
That must have felt sort of defeating.  There is still hope if there isnt a ring on her finger!
Try not to feel that way.  If it was meant to be it would have happened.  There are plenty of other fish in the sea!
Oh wow that is awesome. I remember when those came out. Everyone wanted to have one!
Its crazy how many toys they have now. Disney is really pushing the merchandise out!
Howd he do that?
Sounds like a mess how much did it cost to replace?
Oh thats not good! What happened?
Thats always a pain! It can take forever but never lasts long enough
Man that is so sad.  I dont know what I would do if my dog ran away!  Did you ever find him?
Thats awesome!  I love a happy ending!
Yeah those guys sure charge a lot. They know they are needed for emergencies hah!
That is a trade that can get very messy. I respect guys that get armdeep in sewage lol!
Is it your birthday?
I hope a nice surprise.
Thats always hard to deal with. What did he do?
Im sorry he did that to you. Maybe it was just a misunderstanding.
I bet you will do well sounds attentve
Way to it really pays off to study and a CPA thats impressive
How sad ... you must be desolate
There are other cats that need help
im sorry to hear that. no chance of working it out?
im sorry to hear that
did you give them the finger ?
i have come across that many times and just shake my head
That must have been really scary. Maybe you like cats instead?
Oh I see. Did you get tested to see if they had any diseases? Strays sometimes have rabies.
Wow thank goodness you didnt hit it for youre sake and the deer
That can happen Ive seen deer walk across a highway
Oh my goodness that is terrible.  They dont have insurance?
I was just about to mention that you should be careful that its not a scam of some sort.
Oh my. That would really tick me off. In my state they will lose their license for that.
Well I hope your insurance company sues them. They should really be more responsible.
in a good way or bad way?
a lot of people are suprised by the GDP
Whoa that is a good neighbor. I hope you return the favor some time!
Dang. I bet there is a great story of how it got there!
Dang. Did she practice a lot leading up to the recital?
Wow! Maybe I should start taking some piano lessons and go to a recital of my own.
Oh wow. Do you think you are going to go?
Thats pretty neat. Where is it at?
That sucks!  Bowling is definitely a hang out with friends kind of sport 
You should join a league and meet some friends with similar interests.
Thats odd. Were they laughing about you?
Oh wow. You always have to be on the look out for the rogue rip in the pants! Thats what got my uncle late in life. RIP in peace.
Whoa I hope you guys have a great honeymoon. Make sure to treat your fiancee right!
Well as long as you have a safe word you should be OK. You also may want to buy some life insurance.
what do you mean by 5?
Ha Ha!  Thats ok.  Ugg...that had to be annoying.  Is he just a puppy
what a joy ... as it is called
Thank God ... thats good
I would have been angry too is it cleanable?
Thats terrible! How did it feel when it happened? Were you mad?
I would be too. Hopefully you channeled your rage to let him know who is king of the road.
It is very nice. Where would you go first with your new car?
Thats terrible. Are you guys still friends?
Thats so sad. Perhaps you should buy him a cake and beg for his forgiveness.
That sounds so relaxing.  What book did you read?
ha ha ha.  Its a good book for sure!
Thats too bad. What was supposed to be coming in the mail?
Well thats good. I hope whatever it is youre waiting for improves your life.
Did he do any damage?
Is the sword in one piece?
How is the food usually?
Dim Sum specifically
What kind of coffee will you get?
Are the coffees there expensive?
I agree with you. I think everything will be fine in the end.
Its good to see that you have a positive attitude about it like me.
That is very nice thing to do.
I understand. You are over the water. Nothing bad could happened.
What was the document?
I would imagine hed be pretty upset
How did you feel?
What kind of car was it?
I had a similar experience the other day at the gas station. Its terrible when that stuff happens.
Yeah but people are only amused because something they fear is happening to someone else. Those people dont matter and its happened to everyone
oh. was it cancelled?
Just ask him. Or you can make the plans
Oh? Did you have fun?
Ah Ive never really been into big TVs. I have a tiny one thats good enough for me!
Has he been needy?
How long do you think itll take for him to recover?
It happens sounds like you need to remove all the bad food from your home
Maybe ask a friend to help keep you in check
Just kidding. There is some products that you can use to avoid those bad experience.
Are they against Trump?
Well I guess Canada doesnt like to take any shit from Trump
What are the books about? 
Which wireless service provider do you have?
I heard they have really cheap plans and you dont get locked into a shitty contract like other providers.
That sucks. I hate when my games are interrupted for any reason.
Oh no. You should invest in something new.
Dont let your ex manipulate you!
Tell him to f off!
No rage quitting?
What do you play. I just preordered Call of Duty BO4
Im gonna look that up
What kind of place is it?
What was your fav dish there?
That is great! You must be so proud!
That is nice that you are so supportive of her.
I bet that brings back a lot of great memories! Is the food good?
What type of food do they serve?
Where on your chest?
Hopefully it works out for you
Wow she can already drive?
She sounds like a great babysitter
Like What are your weaknesses?
You gonna get the job!
Do you not have them anymore?
Im sorry to hear that
Well she is in a better place.
Ddi you take classes or something?
I think I have a good eye too.
My mom does that for a living. I could probably be good at it.
You and me both.
What about a soccer team?
That must save you some time.
One step at a time.
What kind of job does he have in the military?
How long has he been there?
Me too do you like Trump?
I love how direct he is he definitely one of the best presidents in recent years.
I saw the trailer looks good.
I saw her fight once. She kicked butt.
I bet that is a great feeling
Well at least things are starting to look positive for you!
I couldnt get into that game.
I tried to play it. I couldnt get into battlefield either. Maps too huge?
Me either I love adventure movies!
Me too! I love them.
Wow that is impressive.
What will you study?
Its nice to know there are faithful people still out there. Keep it up!
That must mean you really do love and care about her.
You must see them a lot.
At least you can talk on the phone.
I love the fall.
I used to love the piles of leaves when I was younger. Raking is no fun now.
Nice whats the reason?
Will you not go out then?
Oh god you didnt get attacked did you?!
Oh wow. I would have freaked out
Well at least you are okay now.
I love cruises. Where are you guys headed to on the cruise?
Nice! I think I went to Cozumel Mexico with my family in like 2013? It was on the Carnival Imagination cruise it was awesome!
I would be so mad. I am terrified of snakes.
When I was a kid I used to have nightmares that I was on a bridge in a car and the whole car and bridge were covered in snakes. It was awful.
I just read about that today.  Do you think he will be ready for it?
He definitely is cool to watch.
What did they call about?
Wow that is a long time ago.
Thats no good.
People arent tolerating that type of behavior anymore. She had better watch it.
Are you the mother or father? Time flies so fast..
I bet she is going to be a great person when she is older
I bet you are super jealous!
She was probably disappointed at you.
Are you upset about this? Id try meeting hr in person
Should have grabbed the gun.
I would have shot that thing dead and then burned it. Then ate it for dinner.
That is good to hear. Disabilities are never easy for people.
Nothing upsets me more than people getting handicapped plates and not being handicapped.
Maybe he should give you a raise so you can stay.
Well you have to think about yourself.
Really? Which one was it? 
Was that in the United States or somewhere else? I used to love All My Children and General Hospital. 
Sounds like fun! I wonder if you could find old episodes online now. 
Oh cool! Any names I might know?
I was just talking about this with my friend. They are getting too old
i know right.
Did you have plans to pick up something special?
I know that was probably embarrassing then but can you at least laugh about it now?
Are you making some good progress?
You must be quite proud how much can you lift?
I cant imagine my house on fire. Thats I got home insurance!
I hope you didnt lose too much.
Yeah the crime rate has steadily been rising. Not good.
I miss the good ol days too!
That is awesome. I bet she worked really hard to get that promotion. Good for her.
Cool I hope she continues to be successful. Its good you are encouraging her!
It feels nostalgic what did you like most about that time period?
Mustve been nice being so free and enjoying your time.
Yes I didnt like it at all. Im not into jump scares.
Yeah no thank you for me.
Was there any reason why?
Thats awesome Ive never had good neighbors so Im pretty jealous of you!
I call my sister that all the time. 
OH. Im sorry. We do that to each other. I  didnt know she hurt your feelings.
Thats Sucks I download games so I dont have that problem
I used to have that problem too. Downloading would take days. Technology saved me there.
Well as long as theyre good people than it shouldnt be that bad. 
What did she do?
Have you told her not to do that?
IT went by fast.
That sucks. Everyone deserves a vacay.
Oh no thats the worst to spend time cooking something and then taking a bite and its awful.
Ive done it before so I feel your pain.
Nice! Are you going scuba divng?
Ah gotcha. Sounds delicious!
What did you carry for her?
Youre so sweet for doing that did she thank you?
What ahappened to the vase?
People still play with those?
Who did she blame?
Well if the cat didnt tell the truth he didnt mind atking the fall.
Hey. It happened to me. It could happen to you too!
Have you ever put butter in your noodles. It elevates them lol
Ive never used cheese. Learn something new every day.
You know thinking about it. I dont think Ive ever had a honey bun...
Wow that sucks. I bet you are so disappointed...
What kind of list is that? Are you bringing them some Christmas cookies?
Oh so maybe you will leave some coal on their doorstep instead. They should be more considerate.
Ok. Thats kinda neat.
Oh I know how that feels.
Aww thats sweet! How old are your kids? 
Yeah I like to have pictures of my loved ones and pets and such at work. It really helps when Im having a rough day.
Oh no. I would have screamed.
Thats nice. No police were involved?
Well at least youre safe.
Aw. No one cooks for me 
Im sorry to hear that. Whats holding you back? 
Youll get there one day!
Just keep working at it. 
Wow the last one? How many seasons have they made?
I need to watch that show in my free time. EVeryone I know talks about that show constantly!
did you get an A?
Come clean and take an F then
Me too. I can focus on myself for a while
I feel the same way.
At least you are thinking back on it and doing some selfreflecting. 
Thats so mean. I bet he just wanted to say good morning to you.
Did you buy a new battery?
Yeah I really liked those hunting trophies he got. We should be allowed to kill any animals we see!
Oh I was thinking of his son. I dont know much about the Donald besides the Twitter stuff.
No thats a little too expensive for me.
Its snails isnt it? Why would anyone want to eat that is beyond me.
That is terrible. What was it for?
Now Thats a no no. Kill him
Oh wow. I have no advice there.
Maybe you should calming ask about it. 
What are you planning on buying? 
You selfentitled brat! Just kidding your mother loves you
Everything closes when we get an inch of snow in the south. 
What is this weekend?
Have you met them before?
I am waiting for Halloween. Its my favorite.
Lol. I do themes with me and my kids. Then I eat all of their candy
Thats awesome. You guys sound very close!
That is so messed up lol
Oh yeah? I heard the circus had to close recently. What is your favorite part?
Elephants are pretty cool. I wonder if they actually like peanuts?
Did you clean it again?
Well that a good thing to study too
Im in school now for psychology. ITs so boring
What do you miss most about being a kid?
Just relaxing and playing?
How old will you be?
Maybe they will party at your house after.
They did? Ive never seen a baseball game lol
There are some real die har fans I miaght have to check it out
I dont believe you.
How did you get the opportunity to meet him?
What will be lit?
That sounds boring.
That is scary! As a 26 year old I cannot imagine actually having kids at this age. Id be running around like a chicken
Thats rough! Im glad youre ok now I hope but that must have been really traumatic 
Oh no!  Did you have a cell phone or did anyone come out to help you?  I literally hate car problems.
Oh great!  I do not have that kind of knowledge at all  maybe you could come with me on the next road trip  LOL!!  
What kind did they get?
Are you a bit jealous?
Its sad actually. But be happy she become independent.
Yeah let her free.
Thats crazy! I hope to propose one day. Congratulations!
Thats great! Disney is a wonderful place to go. I actually live near The Magic Kingdom!
Ugh that is so annoying. Did you say anything?
Good maybe hell learn not to be a jerk next time.
Did you try taken him to a specialist to help with that?
Did you try closing your room?
Rainy days are boring but I do like the sound of them. Its calming in a way
Yea it is better in moderation. Thats true
Thats terrifying. I refuse to swim in the ocean. Too scary.
Glad you are both safe.
Well at least you followed the law and didnt end up running a red light.
Yes Better safe than sorry I guess.
no  but i heard about it in commercials 
i will try on do this asap  dude yesterday i forgot to pay some money i owed my friend i felt kinda of ashamed 
i got payed  went shopping ate dinner then my friend messaged me asking for his money .... i had totally forgot about this
Well maybe your friend will understand.
I know how you feel.
Yeah kids grow up so fast!
That makes me mad
Some people should be more considerate
Where did you move to?
Im sorry.. I moved once from MD to FL so I know how you feel being without your peeps.
Oh. Thats kind of exciting though
Well be yourself. If it doesnt work out think of it as practice!
Hey great! What did you eat?
It is good to just treat yourself sometimes!
Oh dont feel bad! We need to treat ourselves sometimes!
I have heard of that. 
Im so sorry for your loss.
Oh I remember those days.
Are you going to punish them for it?
I have had that happen a few times.
Why is he 2 now?
It wont last much longer.  Before you know it he will be grown up and married.
Well you should enjoy it
That sounds nice.  What did you get?
That is terrible.  I am so sorry
I wish my family lived close. You are lucky
We see each other once a year.
How so? Just used to the way things are?
Oh no are there things you could do outside of your comfort zone? Things you never considered before?
Thats great. I hope she likes the new position.
Why are you so nervous?
Okay I totally understand your feelings.
Thats great. What is he doing now?
Thats even more awesome. I hope he does well.
I do that a lot. 
Aint that the truth!
thats cool that you have one every year.
That could be fun!
Thats great. Ive never gotten a bonuse at work.
I just went on a vaction with my kids. Its was so relaxing. Have fun
Are you tired?
I understand. Taking some rest is important.
Did you get caught?
Dont feel too bad.  Its not like the government gives you money once a year.
Oh no is there a storm approaching?
That is a very good idea.
Im sure theyre not  what makes you think that?
Perhaps next time the bill arrives say something like ok so thats 25 each and take out 25 and put it on the table. They may take the hint.
Congrats! That is great!
That is definitely  something to be proud of.
Sometimes when kids are young they dont get the importance of school
That can be nerve wrecking.
Do you think you did well?
How far are you going?  What school?
Way cool!  Congratulations!  Should be a great experience
I hope you get a good grade. Were you well prepared?
So you dont have to worry about it.
Aw thats so sad I hope you had fun though
At least you had fun too bad the friend missed out their loss
Oh cool!  How pregnant are you?
Ohhhh so you already had her!  Congratulations!
That would be annoying.  How about meeting up with a friend or something?
I’m sorry. What are you going to do?
I like being emotional
I bet.  Its probably cheaper than therapy though!
Lol. Ive done that before.
Sometimes we dont have it. God knows.
I would imagine so.  It is difficult to be away from family for long.
That would probably do the trick.  If not video call your family to touch base more often?
Thats awesome.  Where are you wanting to go?
I live near Disney.. have you ever been?
That can be stressful. Is she ok?
I’m so sorry to hear that. 
Wow that rocks!
I love winning things.  It just makes the whole day perfect lol.
Thats kind of you
I bet she really appreciates you
When does it come out?
Wow that sucks.
Thats kind of you to help her through hard times!
I am sure you will do great.
Lol. Are you embarrased?
I dont like that either.
Thats no good.  Did you get anything good with it?
That is something to be grateful for.
MY boyfriend once said if he ever had to be in a wheelchair he wanted me to kill him. I broke up with him
How old are they?
Its always nice to have a balance in life
I bet you are apprehensive.
They sound very selfish trying to blackmail you like that. I would tell the teachers or professors asap
I am very content with having no car.
That can be very unhealthy for you but its so convenient
Yeah that stuff is addicting
I love Tom Hardy!
He is. And he is nice to look at too lol
What is the dish?
Maybe she can help you and guide you step by step
You had better sleep with one eye open
Me too I like to see them as inspiration
If you work hard enough maybe you can afford in the future!
What is the class?
Economics is pretty cool
Are you a guy too? I bet you were envious of his looks and age hahah
Nice I bet it was super fast!
I hate them too. I havent been on one in ten years.
I would be fine if I never rode one ever again
Thats terrible. Wont the bank help you out?
Im sorry. That really sucks
Are guitars expensive?
Does she want an acoustic or electric one?
What shows are you referring to?
Ill need to check that out!
Thats terrible. Will you be able to get it back?
Well at least you will get it back though.
how long were u together
well then maybe youre better off lol
Nice is it expensive?
I bet you are so proud of yourself! I need to learn how to be self reliant like you!
Congratulations! Whats the job?
Oooohhh Fancy! lol
Thats nice of you do you usually let her go out?
My parents usually did that do. If I dont do the chores around the house I dont get to head out
Lol. That sucks
That has happened to me once or twice.
Dang that sucks. Did you find another class that is open?
I hate it when that happens.
Good luck. What is the class?
Lol. Good luck anyway
That is terrible.  What can you do?
I am sure they will work with you.  Dont stress out.
Aww. Thats nice. Did you dosomething special?
I wish my parents would get my kids. They are too busy having fun themselves lol
Oh no do you know whats wrong? I hate car problems..
Last time my car had problems I had to spend so much money. It was awful.
You should definitely first talk to your friend and clear out the concerns with him before talking to his partner
As I said first ask your friend why is he behaving in such an unacceptable way
Are you going to tell me?
Youre not the only one. I am afraid of complete silence. I think Im about to be murdered.
Im almost afraid to ask
hahaha I am so not one of those people.  I am too old for the technology!
I know right. I was just talking about that with my friends.
tell who what?
Its okay. Youll get through it And yes you should tell her lol
I hope it didnt rain
Good thing nothing bad happen! I would be so devastated if my phone got stolen like that!
That sounds awesome!  What are you going to do?
That is sweet!
What part is that?
Is it the lead role?
LOL.. You crack me up.  
What kinda gun do you have?
Yay! What made you very happy?
Oh yeah!!! I need to get my ass to a legal state to get my card too!
That is no good.  What are they doing?
That is annoying.  Have you thought about talking to them?
What are they pictures of?
Those were the best! werent they?
THat sounds bad.  Are you alright?
It sounds like you need soe distance from them
Are you a helicopter parent?  Do you spin?
Maybe you have went so long without hanging with your friends you forgot you had them.
OH. Thats terrible. 
What is DiGiorno?
Did you give them a home?
Well thats nice. Every one deserves to be in a safe and loving home.
Would you like me to take them?  I like kids sometimes! I totally understand needing a break
Ah!!! Nice lol Summer went by so fast! Summer for parents now
That is awesome.  I love gambling.  Was it a scratch off?  Pick 3?
Its awesome... you can win 50100 often on a 5 scratch off..
Cool where are you heading to?
Oh wow! I always thought kangaroos were really interesting animals!
That sounds like fun! What kind of park is it?
Great! Make sure to pack sunscreen. Hot here where I am
That sounds terrible.  What can you do?
I definitely agree you need to set up the boundaries.  Make sure you keep that up for the sake of everyone involved.
I had to buy a fruit fly trap this summer as well.  But as soon as I set it up they stopped flying around.
I feel your pain.. I really do!
Oh lord I hate the vets! What happened?
Oh man! You know some meds can cause that. Look in too Similasan. They have one that prevents cataracts etc. Expensive ingredients but some are the some from people and dog meds for cataractsdry eye etc.
That sounds great.  What do they like to do in the yard?
THat is so sweet.  I hope the weather stays nice
Going for a road trip?
Awesome sounds like fun! I hope you have a safe trip.
Aww how cute. Do you miss playing with your cat?
Its alright. Your cat is somewhere up in heaven.
What are you going to school for? Online or in person?
Oh that is tough! Oh man especially at an alternative one. Make sure you do a lot of self care and dont take stuff too personally from kids 
What did that do.. 
I am sorry that someone did that to you..
I know how you feel. I hate lairs.
But you have to do it otherwise you wont be able to trust her.
Thats unfortunate.  Especially when theres nothing you can do to stop it.
It can be a vicious cycle. Ive seen it before.
Oh man! Are they car keys as well?
Oh my god! Well please get ALL your locks changed. The car will be more difficult however hopefully they have no idea where you live so you should be ok.
Oh god! How did you get in finally did you contact your mom?
That is very difficult. I wish you will find a solution.
I understand. Take it easy.
What are you studying?
Oh great! That has a lot of jobs. I hope you did well!
Tell me about it! I think about getting off as soon as I walk in!
Yeah. A job is better than no job I suppose.
That is no good.  I bet he regrets it!
I hope so that is frustrating. 
Aww that is so sad to hear. Im glad that she has a good home now though!
Thats amazing! I wish more people were willing to do what youre doing to help out our furry friends!
What are the pros of switching jobs?
Well actually desk jobs are much harder on my body and can be really bad for your back and hips etc if its a desk job? Well if you are getting older you might want to start saving up have a side hustle and maybe think about it? Less pay but more peace health and time is always worth it 
I also have a dog that was starved when she was young! She is so afraid of everything even to this day but shes almost 8!
What breed of dog is she and how old? Thats so awesome! Dogs are so resilient and it can teach us a lot about how we should live our own lives.
Awesome! Mine is also a pitbull mix! I call her my little bunny in pitbull form! They are the best dogs ever.
OHH! I Love chickens ! I have always wanted some. I have a duck! lol What kind of chickens are they?
Oh man! They fight sometimes. I hope they arent too bad about waking you up in the morning. Chickens can be very sweet though!
Maybe you should be straight with him?  That’s the only thing that will make it good in my opinion. 
I know the type.  There are better people out there that you just have to be patient for. 
Were you all best friends as children?
Oh geez thats hard! I am glad you get to see them again. treasure such moments!
Now thats dedication!
Keep it up. One day you might appear in a fitness magazine. 
I love that when that happens! What is it for?
Love that! Glad you found it
Yeah dogs have to learn how to play.  Kinda funny you dont always consider that.
It depends on how young they are.  I have a rescue that was abused but she was real young.  She snapped out of it.
Im great how are you doing?
thats great to hear  getting along better with the other students ?
Thats awful  i hate bullying have you told the principle ?
what did they advice  any martial arts schools around your area maybe start your kid in it
Do you know who sent them?
Awesome was there any special occasion?
I bet that was fun to look through
That would be cool.  Are you going to keep them?
i hope that you did well on them
I cant stand people who treat animals horribly.
I hope you call the cops on them so they can go to jail for animal abuse.
I understand. Did you catch some of them in action?
That is bad. I would have the same feeling if I was in your situation.
I hear you! How old are you? As we get older all kinds of stuff doesnt work the same
Try keto and fasting or find a diet like RAW and you will be amazed at your energy and strength again!
Some people have incredible energy and drive! 
True! Often managers do not deserve that role. I am glad he does!
Oh my god I HATE when people do that! That stuff can land on someones windshield!
Wow thats horrible! I would have been so pissed.
Oh my goodness! Why did he move away?
Are you all still together? Long distance can be hard but honestly absence makes you love them even more!
How come you can sit also?
That’s too bad
That is nice. Babysitting kids is sometime nice.
That is terrible.  How do they get away with it?
I am sorry you have to deal with that
That is always good! Errands can be a pain!
I am glad you got some things done! Now you can rest
I guess I never  thought about weather or not car insurance covers your own injuries too
Yeah theyre really expensive. 
Its been a mix of a rollercoaster lol.
Wow! Are you going to stay now?
I understand! I would be too! 
That is great what was wrong with the dog how was it abused 
That is absolutely awful to hear poor dogs don not deserve to be mistreated in such ways  im happy the dogs better 
Me also when I was young.
That is disappointing. I am sorry
Have you tried talking to them?
I hate bullies but they usually get whats coming to them.
I know how you feel. Sometimes you just have to show them the error of their ways. If not karma will catch up with them.
That is incredibly kind of you I hope he is a good driver 
You are a great friend! We all need help at some point
Oh wow! Id be afraid to go outside! I hope you are able to stay safe!
That sounds very scary. Ever thought of moving?
I wish you luck! I really hope you can get out of there soon.
I hear you! Have you thought about starting a side business?
great! there are SO many opportunities out there with the internet
That is very nice of him to welcome that poor dog
That is really cool.  good on you for welcoming them
Payday is fantastic! What kind of clothes did you buy?
Do you ever use poshmark or mercari? Those are good for deals. Sounds like you got some nice stuff! Payday is always a fun day
I SO HEAR YOU! lol! Being grown up has its perks but its not as great as we thought it would be with all the responsibilities. We ARE the mom and dad now ha
i freakin  hate that like dude be sad or mad on your own dont take it out on your family friends  or co workers 
Exactly great minds think alike  that is always so annoying as hell 
That is good to hear! Are there any issues?
Oh lord  I have a partner doing the same thing and he feels more like a son a lot. That must be so hard. Being a parent is the HARDESt job ever. I am so very sorry. I hope he snaps out of it soon.
How come you were worried about it?
It sounds like it might be time to consider moving on without them
Things were much simpler when we were kids. You are your brother must have a close relationship.
Im sorry to hear that. I guess it makes the times you do see each other even more special!
Oh no!  Was anyone around?
That is no good. I bet that was embarrassing. 
Thats disgusting. Did you move to another table?
Thats awful.  Some people are disgusting.
I am sorry to hear that. How are you feeling now?
I understand. It is tough.
Wow that doesnt happen very often. Well done. Those things are normally quite expensive arent they?
Me too. Clearance is the first place I head for in the store! It must be so difficult to be gluten intolerant  seems as if theres gluten in everything these days.
Something I found which helped me lots was to eat e.g. bread made from organic wheat. So long as I dont overindulge Im fine  fingers crossed.
Boy you are having a tough time. Someone suggested buying imported pasta from Italy as the wheat doesnt have the same pesticides sprayed on it as us wheat. Dunno if it works tho.
How long has it been?
Whoa! SO needed! What did you guys do?
I am sorry that you had to go through that.  
That is too bad.  It sounds like you need some knew people to surround you
You were suppose to start the conversation with a situation based on the context chosen.
I hope the hit will not be rejected.
im sorry to hear that i was born with a lot of anxiety so i can somewhat relate
I honestly started taking cbd oil by charlottes web and my anxiety went away after a few days of using it 
OH! That is the best isnt it? What will you do with it?
Oh awesome! Its always nice to have those little surprises in life.
What good thing are you waiting for exactly?
Im sure youll find someone. 
It is good to maintain that contact with people
That is ok sometimes but getting out is important for you too
Oh yes what is the temperature where you are?
OH! I love around 70! That is perfect. Oh its over 80 here getting a little hot but it will  be nice when its night time  Nothing like a good  summer to lift the spirits
That is awesome!  Congratulations!  So you are prepared for everything that is about to happen?
It sure sounds like you have done everything you can to make the day special!
Did you tell his parents?
That must of been no fun hopefully he wont do it again.
I know Christmas was the best when we were children. Now that were adults its not as exciting.
Yeah I used to love waking up in the morning and run downstairs to open my presents.
What is going on?  Have you seen the dr?
I am so sorry you have to worry about that 
That is nice. Are you planning activities to do with them?
That is great
thats cool i bet she will have fun
That is really a bummer. Have you looked online for it somewhere else?
That’s no good. 
Thats awesome. How come you guys didnt get to see each other often before?
Was it for work school etc?
Why did she leave?
Does she have another job already?
Wow that must have been embarrassing. 
That is so true!
That sounds really nice! Does it just look better or is travel better?
That will make getting exercise during or after work a lot easier.
That is a very nice person. You are lucky.
I lost my wallet once but didnt find money in it when it was returned to me.
Old photos can be so nostalgic. Do you have a favorite memory?
Adult life can definitely be difficult but we get a lot of freedom now though.
Thats amazing! What are you studying?
what kind of job are you hoping to get?
That sounds amazing!
Its pretty early to have Christmas planned already. I should get on that as well.
When will you find out?
Hopefully you win what is the prize?
i used to be not quite as much anymore
yes my friends play it
Oh me too. Have you ever messed with them?
Where are you going boating?
What do you like to do on the lake?
thats crazy! was he ok?
thats great.  i love kids
Was it for a contest or a class?
Oh no must be disappointing. Are you putting off making it now or will you go in search for the missing mustard?
Will it taste the same?
Do you like museums?
Same here. Neither do I but there are impressive museums out there that kinda make you change your stance.
I love going to Costco.
I always get rice and steak there.
Oh cool!  What kind of turtle was it?
It sounds like it may have been a box turtle.  They are good as pets!
Maybe you can have them get you on one of the kiddie ones first?
Hope you have fun!
I always worry about that too. Is it early in the morning?
Will you be able to leave a little bit earlier to allow time for any traffic delays?
Are you in your basement?
That is smart hopefully thou it doesnt happen.
thats unfortunate sucks missing out on time with your family
you definitely gotta appreciate them while you can
Thats really nice.   Sometimes things work out ok.
Did you just forget your wallet or did you not have any money at all?
lol a trap for what?
I guess youre not at all attracted to her then?
Aww I just had to put my dog down last month.
It was very sad and I am sorry you had to go through that
That was very nice of him.
How long have you known him?
Oh are you guys distant?
Im glad you guys can start to come together again.
Oh no why didnt they?
I guess you might have to reconsider this friendship.
When is the competition?
What is the grand prize?
i love taking trips where was your favorite place to go?
ive been there several times but its not my favorite place
That was nice of him did you put gas in it?
Did you drive it fast?
Oh god why did he do that?
Bad situations make you things you wouldnt normally sometimes. Did you talk to him about it?
Oh my! Were you okay?
Yeah that would be a little embarrassing I am sure. 
Thats sad. is she going to get another one?
Thats good. Its important for the elderly to have some company.
thats great its always good to plan ahead
im the same way
If you love the house. go for it.
You need to do some prosmection and you will find the rate interest that you want.
Weve all done stupid things. Im sure theyll let it go eventually.
Youll know for next time now. I know you must feel really bad.
Uh oh!  What happens if you cant get an earlier flight?  Will you miss the wedding?
I would be feeling quite anxious if I were you!  I am sure it will work out for you!
That sounds terrifying! Are you okay now?
Makes you appreciate life more doesnt it.
I love Korean barbeque.
Is it open 24 hours a day?
Im so sorry to hear that. How long ago was this?
its terrible to lose someone. Was this expected or sudden?
have you swam before?
just gotta be careful where you swim
That was a wonderful surprise I am sure.
Oh wow! What a blessing!
Oh my gosh! Im so sorry to hear that.
I know thats gonna to be a terrible loss for the family. 
Did it ruin the laptop?
Are you going to buy him a new one?
Was it your first race?
That must really disappointing. Will you race again?
where has he been?
thats cool. what does he do for a living?
Are you going to take one?
Yikes thats a little crazy.   Are they cat collectors?
Is it gonna turn out bad without it?
Thats a relief then! Hope its still delicious!
thats really awesome!
im really glad to hear it got worked out
Those little guys are quite nimble!  Did is surprise you?
Yeah I guess they need to be agile to escape all the neighborhood cats!
That sounds awful! Did they give an explanation?
You must be disappointed. Im sorry.
Im inclined to agree with you.  Thats kinda strange.  The guys ok with it? 
Mustve been really nostalgic. Did you guys catch up on your lives now?
what kind of cake do you like?
haha me too never met a cake i didnt like.
Going to a new restaurant is always fun!  I am sure it will be great if there are a bunch of positive reviews!
Yummmy!  That sounds amazing!  I am sure you will have fun!
Its nice to know the time your spent studying paid off! Congrats!
Better to be over prepared than under.
maybe they went to see a movie?
can you call them on their cell?
Thats exciting.  How did that go?
Thats almost a little strange.  Do you still have any interest in her?
What dish are you trying out?
Oh now youre just making me hungry!
Boo!  Did it make you mad?  I would have been!
Rightly so!  Nothing worse than expecting something and then it not being there!
Must be really lonely. Youre not trying to go on a guys night out or anything?
Thats really sweet! Maybe they miss you too.
That sounds so relaxing! What kind of dog do you have.
Dogs are a good source of entertainment.
that is interesting.  did you ever date?
oh yes thats true.  i thought you might have dated later in life. 
Thats prett cool. Has she shown you?
Oh so youre both hunters!
Some habits die hard.  My moms always trying to send me food still.. Im a grown man.
I know right.  Its kind of annoying but also kind of nice.
wow where did yall live at the time.
So you guys never did visits or anything?
Must feel terrible. Well at least you dont have to look after them then.
I love dogs! what kind?
mutts are the most loveable.
That sounds like a good night.  what movie?
hachi.  best dog movie ever.
That sounds exciting.  How long will you be staying?
Thats cool. Do you have everything planned out?
Sounds nice. Whats the temperature where you are?
I think I wouldnt go outside in close to 100 degree weather. Thats crazy.
Thats great! I wish more people would garden so much healthier to grow your own food.
Thats fabulous.  Love it when the older generation teaches the younger ones.
Thats awesome! You must be feeling more alive and well
Its amazing how reaching those kinds of health goals brings things that you would have never even imagined before going through with it
Right you always see the before and after pictures of other people but as youre doing it it seems to take forever
Yeah a lot of the times it would just come back as fast as it got lost
Insurance companies suck.  I hate dealing with them.
Theyre trying to not pay if they dont have too.    more  in their bank.
That is awesome!  I would love to get something like that from a relative!  Does it have any sentimental value?
That was so nice that your were chosen to get it and hopefully pass it on again!
Wow! 6th grade thats amazing. Are you planning on celebrating?
Fun! He must be really passionate about learning 
Thats really special and a great attitude to have
Looks like the future is bright for him
Cool where do you get your venison from?
Anymore? Are they ever safe??
What made hers unsafe?
Cool you guys can race and whoever loses gets a new one
Good How long havent you talk to each other?
Wow she is a little weird.
I bet that feels good
It definitely does.  You shouldnt have to stress about your job
It sounds like you have a lot of animals!
For sure they can teach us a lot
That is very considerate of you. What are your duties as class mom?
Ah I miss naps. If only I could go back to Kindergarten.
Those are so gross.
Did you put the cat in time out?
Oh cool.  You got it then?
Oh no!  Are you alright?
Oh I bet! How long has it been?
That will be a very nice reunion.
I miss mine too. Where did you guys grow up?
Canada is such a beautiful country. Was there a lot of things to do there for you kids?
Nice. Good luck with that. You are interviewing for which position?
Wow. Good luck. I hope you get the position.
That sounds relaxing
What game did you play?
It is a great feeling when we can say that. My 37th child just became selfsufficient last year as well!
I know! I think my wife is calling it quits after the 38th though.
Sorry to hear!  What all did you order?  And what was wrong with it?
Cold fries are the worst bc the potatoes are just gross at that point.  Did you get your money back at least?
Oh bless your heart!  Im sorry to hear!  Id have returned it and gotten the whole meal free for the cold messed up fries!
Thats good! Hopefully youll be compensated in some way for the fries.  Ugh cold fries!  Youre way nicer about it than I would have been.
Nice. What did you buy?
Ah a must in a household of rugrats.
Are you mad at them?
Oh my word! I thought bobcats were mythical like unicorns.
wow. was it expensive?
Awesome!  Are you excited to go?
You sound prepared!  I am sure you will make a good impression on the other party goers!
Oh wow!  You were pretty angry
I guess you are right
Neat! Where are you going?
Sweet! What are you going to be doing there? Always wanted to take a journey to the South.
Oh. wow. Did you cry?
Your kid should be on Americas got Talent! unless youre not in america.
What is your new job like?
Thats pretty neat! I work in a Nike sweatshop in Siberia so I really cant say the same!
Physics? That must be crazy hard.
Well good luck. I think youll do well if you studied that hard.
All one? I prefer to be all two in my house.
Yeah being alone a big ole house is often times more spooky than not. I almost got nabbed by a ghost the last time I was alone.
Ugh thats the worst!  Bright side  at least you werent far from home that you were able to clean everything up right?
blinks  One I didnt know possums travelled in herds and two I am only hoping your day didnt get worse from there?
Bless it!  And you survived all of that to tell the tale!  And all of this over a busted garbage bag!  We gotta get you a better brand of garbage bags friend.  
Good job!  How are you doing so far?
It is tough.  Dont be too hard on yourself.  Just do better moving forward
Thats so true. I was scared to put my kids in daycare
Wow! They are pretty lucky!
Yes that would be nice.
Awesome a bird left the nest.  How old is he?
Awe a little sentimental? 
That wonderful!  Did he initiate it?
That’s great and a relief
I know the feeling
I definitely know that feeling lol
Are you still close?
Thats sad. Have you reached out to her?
Thats not bad. I only see people in my family once ever few years.
Oh wow! Congrats?  Boy or girl?
That is great that you are prepared!
Its always nice to have some good friends.
I do have a few really good ones. 
That sounds exciting!  Are you nervous about it?
Its not the easiest thing to do and so very few states ask for it.  The state I come from requires it.  Its just something you use in so very few situations Im surprised they still test for it.
Sounds like a plan!  thats the only way youll get better!
Are you scared or excited?
My first few years I went from the east coast to Colorado. It will be the best time of your life.
Enjoy it before you get old. Before you know it college will be over and you will be a slave to student loan payments.
Ive been there.
What kind of restaurant?
Man that is pretty crazy being that young even.
Me two. No bills and just relax and play.
Being stressed never helps. 
It could always be worse. People in the 3rd world are on the edge of death from having no food.
It is ok. If the teacher was not angry it should be fine.
We have cold winters but hardly ever any snow. Im glad too
Did you follow him home and confront him?
Perhaps he thought the same about you?
Howd she do?  Did she get the right clothes?
Were the three things not in the dress code?
Yiiiiiiiiiiikes!  Long sleeves in the heat!  cringes  Times like these make me glad our schools went to uniforms!  But I understand about the heat  were in short sleeved polos until November at the earliest.
Sounds like what kids would do!  But the bright side is if you have two days worth of fall or winter shes prepared!
Oh no what was it?  Not too bad I hope.
That isnt half as bad as what I was thinking it might be.  Glad to hear it was just overindulging in food.  Oh well you always have tomorrow to be better!
That is awesome. You should marry her again lol
Thats awesome!  I know that took a lot of hard work!
Thats the best way to go about it  make sure you have time for all the things you need time for.  That way youre not running around like a chicken with your head cut off.
Are you gonna try to keep that sort of balance going forward?
Are you going to eat them?
Give them to a homeless person.
That is great when that can happen but it doesnt always if one or both love a lot! I hope you remain friends.
I hope so too!
That is terrible.  Did you lose all the food that was in there or were you able to save it?
That is so terrible.  It would be nice if the refrigerator company had to replace all of your groceries if their product breaks!  Did you get a new one yet?
Thats awesome. Congratulatios
Just hope for a happy healthy baby!
Congratulations. Yes it can be very hard to get pregnant and carry children for some. I know how that goes
I do but both are in heaven. But they are still my children..doctorsmidwive mistakes on me in a lawsuit and so it affected the second one. Not trying again until I can go to a specialized doctor and get in perfect health.
Be very careful. It was just an untreated UTI in me and then they wouldnt help me when I had HELLP syndrome for awhile..I went to a few doctors too..none were goodand I was full term..I almost bled out..The littlest things sometimes can really hurt you and your baby. I am so sorry! I am so glad you had 1 take good care of yourself and follow your gut 
Oh how adorable! There are so many bunnies around right now.  My parents house has especially a lot of them and they dont really run off like normal either.
That is so precious.  I have never seen that before.  Baby bunnies are the best!  Ive had 3 bunniesrabbits in my lifetime and they were great pets.  What are your bunnies names?
lol oh no!  My albino rabbit I had when I was younger was like that....skittish beyond belief!  Those are adorable names!
Not to me!  Some part of me is anxious to be holding a grandchild and then when they poop or get fussy to hand them riiiiiiight back to their parents!
On the one hand I miss them because theres nothing in the world like baby smell.  On the other the best day of my life so far was when my youngest was pottytrained!
A.ww that must have been so cute
Ive never seen a bunny. Thats weird
Oh no! That is a hard thing to think about. You might want to take some time apart and find it out to be fair to him
Well think about what qualities he has There are so many dishonest people out there and abusive people. Sometimes we dont connect with someone good..but will regret it later. Definitely think on it as youd never want to lose a good trustworthy person even if you just keep them as a friend
Aw I am sorry they will be back soon though?
Never bad good mom or dad  They are only young once
That makes me mad too
People let things get out of hand and it is so unecessary.
Uh oh! Was everything ruined?
Oh how disappointing. 
That must feel awesome
I feel that way when my kids are gone
I swear the DMV is the worst!
Yeah but the state would never get out of debt if they had to pay the people for missing work just to wait in inefficient lines at the DMV.
Thats understandable. What happened?
Thats hard. Are they in a new relationship? I hope it wasnt a bad breakup?
Thats hard! If he was bad to you I hope you are able to get over it if not you can always reach out 
you have to let those people go
Lol. Thats gross
I wouldnt either. She should find another job lol
Thats no good. How did that happen?
Dang. Well I bet that really worked to get your point across haha
Oh wow.  Thats a long time.  How old were you when you first went in?
Ha ha.  Now I know youre kidding me.  50 years?  I think you served your time for that offense wiouldnt you say?
South Carolina is really nice. What are you planning on doing there?
Sounds like a grand ole time. Everyone likes the good ole carriage ride every now and again.
Did you get a call back?
We believe it and you just might
Oh darn that is stressful I bet.
Thats no good. How does that happen?
I happy youre not being abused either.
Some people make it to the other side. Im glad ou did.
I hear you  I do the same
I know right? I am working on a side business so I can do that one day. You should totally get a side hustle.
I understand! What are you going to school for?
I bet it can help people and pay a lot in a career as well. Good luck!
Ouch sounds like you really like working out with your friends.
Im no doctor but it sounds like you might need even more to balance things out.
After being married for that long I really dont blame you. Do you want to move on and find someone else?
Well if thats how you feel then maybe it is best if you stay in the dugout and dont play the field. No shame in that.
Did she get into any trouble?
Well that was very nice of her. Did you give her anything in return?
Did she get a cute bandaid?
Thats sweet. You shouldve took a picture and framed it so you guys can cherish that moment forever
I hear ya there.  When did you lose her
That is exactly how I would describe my grandma.  YOu are lucky to have had her
That is very nice to friendly neighboors.
Yes Now days most neighbors dont talk to each other.
Congratulations!  Im sure everything is going to turn out well.  You probably have to see your doctor more than usual to make sure everything is okay.
Thats definitely a good sign!
That sucks. Why did heshe do that?
Yeah ignorance in youthfulness is sometimes a good thing. Thats really terrible of your ex though. He should be burned at the stake.
I used to think that too. I could sleep if it wasnt closed all the way
And you could have caught him in the closet!!!
Oh wow!  Did the guy get caught?
That would be.  I am so sorry you had to go through that.
That sounds like you have some good help now. How old are they?
Its good that they are thoughtful sound like very well mannered kids!!!
What position do you play?
Are you taking some orange slices to spice things up?
What was holding you back?
If you could do it all over again how would you overcome  and pardon me for saying this your wimpyness?
That is awesome.  Did you find out what it was for?
That sounds like a jolly good time ole chap. What showsmovies are you planning on watching?
Nice. The Office is one of my favorite shows. I do enjoy Steve Carrells character.
Awwwww!  You guys are doing the right thing.  How is it doing today?
Thats fair enough.  I wouldnt know what to do with a hurt bird.
That is bad. Did you already made reservation and purchase airline tickets?
Good. There was no else that could replace the person sick?
Wow. I bet that was a nice surprise. Did you get a lot of presents? 
Sounds great. You are lucky to have such thoughtful coworkers. 
Oh wow that is disgusting
What are you going to do?
Where do you guys work?
Thats pretty neat. I imagine is very nice working from home. I wish I could so that I can stop working at the Nike sweatshop.
Thats a bummer. Did you get it repaired?
Well thats good. At least everything turned out okay in the end.
Oh wow I bet that made you smile
That is very awesome
That sounds like a lot of fun. Did you ride a lot of rides?
Did you ride any that made you sick? Some of the ones that go upside down always make me sick. haha.
I am sure they learned from you
I am as well. Even if it is a simple thatched roof.
Indeed. The world can use a lot less people.
How come it felt bad?
That is terrible.  WHy?
Yes thats always a good thing. Have you been working long?
Wow. I bet you are grateful to be working. Being jobless is a horrible place to be. 
That is no good. How is she doing now?
That is horrible!  I wouldve been too.  That actually happened to me but thankfully it was an old account that I didnt use.  Did they take money from you?
I just think thats the worst way for the IRS to do things though. Life is hard and once you have debt from any numbers of things it can be hard to climb back out of the red.  Im so sorry you had that shock and I hope they work with you on payments.  
Hell have a great time though.  Hell make tons of friends and his days will be full of joy!  You will need some hobbies though.
With all the extra time you have you should start a counseling service.  I know your mom would use you!
Did you have fun
I do love getting gifts
Thats awesome. Are you and your aunt close?
Thats cool man. Im really not close to any of my relatives.
Im sorry to hear that. What made you scared?
Wow! I bet that is scary. Good to know you made it okay. 
what did they advise you to do?
Awesome.  Are you nervous?
You definitely will
Thats really neat. Did you guys have an easter egg hunt?
Thats cool. Who collected the most eggs?
What band was it?
You need to speak up next time
Good thats what needed to happen
How come you were afraid?
yea i think we have all been there
I am sorry I am sure he will be safe
I am sure you are
Four is a pretty cool number. I am a bigger fan of 5 though.
What was wrong with your Dad?
Oh no. Im so sorry.  I feel you.  I lost my sweet springer spaniel Pepper not long ago. Are you coping okay?
Well thats a wonderful thing.  You had a good time with the first one and this new one will breathe life into your day and pull any sadness away.  What will you name it?
Its nice to have someone that is helpful around the house.  Does he work too?
Well that is too bad.  Maybe there is some way you can motivate him to work harder.
why is that
i hope it turns out well for you!
It is.  What are you referring to?
of course you were
Wow. How did you manage to eat that many? Maybe you should have shared. 
You should enter a eating contest. Sounds like you could win. 
That sucks. How does that make you feel?
Yeah thats how it was with my younger brother too. He always go his way.
That’s no good. Why?
That would scare me too
oh sorry to hear that
Dang that sucks. When do you find out if you got the job?
I think you are overreacting. Just try to find your medicine and calm yourself down. I am sure you will get the job.
That sounds terrible! Im sorry that happened to you. I hope everything is okay now. Do you know what caused it?
Eww.. Rotten eggs.. Thats terrible. I know eggs are so healthy for you but I never touch them partly because of how they smell when theyre cookedprepared in certain ways. Again Im sorry you had to deal with that. Was there anybody nice enough to help you when you were on the bus or how did that end up?
That is really something to be proud of
Why not just call him? Its not unheard of.
Maybe he is just busy right now. I wouldnt lose hope yet. 
That is a good news. Did he kept them with him for a long period of time?
That sucks. What sport?
Youre not good at a single one of those? I was a strong swimmer when I was a kid.
i can understand that
the NICU thats wonderful
Oh fun!  What kind of dog does she have?  Whats its name?
My mom had a husky named Heidi for almost 16 years.  They are beautiful dogs but boy can they run away fast if they get an opportunity.
Sometimes sibling rivalry dies hard  even when youve well outgrown it. Are yall far apart in age?
I love your heart. Thats important. Are you a brother or a sister to them?
Please do. Sometimes it takes time to mature on an emotional level. Its cool that you have that on them 
Nice! Where did you meet your date?
Thats really cool. Where is the date going to be at?
That is nasty. What are you going to do?
I am with you 
How did that feel?
that is awesome
That must be hard sometimes but I guess also has its advantages. 
I bet. Maybe he will move closer to you soon. 
Thats awesome.  What level of math is it?
I always had trouble with math so anything above counting is beyond what I feel competent in.  Good luck on the test!
Thats really cool! What kind of memories resurfaced?
Oh I am sorry for being so insensitive. I am sure your mother is in a better place.
Wow! What happened?  I hope everything is  okay.
What? Nothing too bad I guess...
did he get ma?
hellz yea.. all about number 1
That is terrible my friend. How do you think it is going to affect your friendship
Im sure it wont be too bad. You just have to work hard and hopefully youll get promoted next time.
Oh cool!  Do you play in the game or get to be the cooler part of the team the waterboy?
Ha ha! Awesome!  I bet youre great at it!  Get out a hose and just water them down! Its faster.  Hope you have a great game tomorrow!  Dont forget the orange slices.
Why are you going to the court?
I understand. I hope things will go smoothly.
That is good.  You will feel better
That is horrible. Were you able to do anything about it.?
I am so sorry to hear that. I wish there was something more you could do.
Ir is almost all kid that do that. He will get used to it.
People can be bad some time. I hope it will be better.
well at least you made it through
oh yea im not surprised though.
yea after the finals at least he didnt go to the GSW haha
What is your interview for?
Thats pretty cool. Do you think you will get the job?
That sounds really peaceful
That is so good for the soul
I bet that brought back memories. Hopefully good ones. 
Wow I bet that was a happy surprise. I love looking at old pictures. 
Are you alright?
I am sorry you have to deal with that. 
how did it go? congrats btw
hah .. it gets better
Why did your family leave? Sorry that you felt that way.
What did you do all by yourself?
Oh my god. Did you guys have a fight?
Its just an extra tomato man. Youre going to let that ruin your relationship with your turtle?
Oh yeah? What is going to be your hallmark meal?
Cant go wrong the sushi and steak special. A classic in Alaska.
Thats too bad. Why were you all alone?
Interesting. Why wouldnt they take you along?
oh wow.. how are you feeling
It was the right thing to do. Getting used to not having someone around is going to take some time.
It will take time but Im sure youll be okay.
What a monumental event!  I bet youre so excited.  What took her away for so long?
She sounds smart.  Are you nervous at all or just thrilled to be with her again?
Is the dog potty trained?
That pool noodle must be terrifying for her.
Did your cat show the bird whos boss?
Thats somewhat offensive.
No I havent. Is it good? 
Sounds interesting. I will have to check it out. 
I will. But I dont scare easily. 
Thats so sad. Im sorry
Have you ever tried writing? Thats what I do
Youre hosting a party? or attending one? Either way social gatherings can always be a lot of pressure so thats why I usually avoid them unfortunately. What are some of your worries if you dont mind me asking?
Oh so youre hosting. Man thats definitely hard. I really do feel for you as I wouldnt have the courage to do that. Well since youre worried about it at least it shows you care. And you still have plenty of time to prepare! Do you have anyone that can help?
That is so sweet!
It is a good sign that she shows that kind of care to them
damn did you do it all alone or you had help? are you lebron james living in a mansion?
ah thats understandable 
Im sorry to hear that! Did you find your dog?
Did you try calling your local shelter?
Oh no. You didnt have anyone to go with?
Wow. Thats some friends you have there.
Did everyone end up contributing to the project?
I am sure they will. They have to if they want to get a good grade.
Tornados are terrifing. Are you ok?
Thats good to hear. Glad youre ok.
Lectures can be boring
I do miss some of my class
where you going?
oh that sounds great. good luck
why did they say no?
Im so sorry.. I wish I could fix that for you.
That sounds like it could be fun or was it sad?
Oh no! Well those arent such good friends.
That is too bad. Why are you on the keto diet?
Yeah that diet is somewhat expensive. Has it been hard sticking to it?
History is a lot of memorizing. Glad you did well.
How were the rest of your exams?
Oh well there is always next weekend
I am sure you will find something
Oh lord that made me almost vomit! I choke easy too I am sorry!
Not your fault at all! Somethings cant be helped.
I did attend college but I am one of those statistics you hear about....a dropout.
Im sorry to hear that. Sometimes kids dont know how to interact well with each other. But its an important part of the socializing part of life that they work their way through it. All you can do is tell them how to respectfully and appropriately respond and defend themselves.
Ah.. so its that kind of situation. Yeah it can be one thing if its just something where kids are acting like kids and you cant physically intervene in time. But its another if you think its neglect and that theyre not responding appropriately to the situation. I would trust your judgment. I hope everything ends well with it though! Im sure you gave your child lots of love afterward.
It happens even when we study hard sometimes!
true! Life is full of learning I am glad you have learned something from it so many dont. Kudos!
I am sorry was the cat okay
That does sound scary
Good for her. Never too late to go back to school.
Oh wow. She sounds like super woman!
I dont blame you. Those things are creepy
I got a clown for my daughters 4 birthday. Every single kids cried lol
I understand that I am not either with some of my family! We are not always born in too families that are like us
I am sorry are they very mean or abusive?
Well then its no loss! Find family in others. That is no family!
Cat room? Ive never heard of such a thing.
Did any of the cats get out?
Maybe you should get cameras
wow thats great
every few years.. and its enough!
Yeah thats never something to complain aboutwell unless you were fired I guess but that doesnt sound like that was the case! Im happy for you too. Did you do anything fun with your extra time?
Well that was nice of you. Im glad you got a chance to squeeze in more family time and didnt go spend it just sitting around or something. I hope that happens more often for you.
Fun!  Those can be addictive for me.  I only get them around Christmas time...not sure why but its a fun stocking stuffer.  Did you win?
I hope you win too!  Scratch them now and let me know if you win.  Now Im excited for you! Hope you hit a big bank!
Oh wow.. are you going there to surprise her
well dont worry too much ... the food isnt the most important thing and I am sure it will at least be satisfactory.  Focus on the family
That is not good. So no way to get the info back
I am sorry that sounds terrible
Does your dad still live nearby?
I am so sorry to hear that. His memory lives on though.
Oh gross! What restaurant?
I would blast them on social media. That is not good especially for them not to take responsibility for it.
Yea. Floors get dirty pretty quickly with dust. Will you be replacing the vacuum?
I actually got a vacuum myself but made a bad decision. The thing does not suck well.
What breed is it?
I love boxers and their cut off tails.
Wow. I hope it was a clean diaper.
Who knew a diaper would be so terrifying.
That sounds like so much fun.  I hope you have a good relaxing time.  Where are you going?
I hope its a better experience by the pier than mine.  hahahaha.
Thats good. Are you getting the hang of it?
Its better to write things down than try to keep things in your head.
That sucks. What store is it?
We have a lot of those where I live.
Nice! Is this your first time having that done?
How come what happened?
Oh geez! lol! Just watch tv online  I do that way always something I like I can watch
I love cheesecake
Oh no! Was is plain or did it have sweet toppings too?
I wish I could make a cheescake.
What stores are you going to
News clothes are always nice
oh my gosh!  I am glad you are ok!!!
Where do you live?  Kansas?
Oh dogs are so sweet. Was it your first time?
he lived? Oh no. What happened?!
what did you do
good luck next time!
Thats amazing first child?
Cherish every moment they grow up SO fast!
Isnt that the best feeling when something you really want is actually on deep discount and you are just in the right place at the right time!
I am right there with you.  I hope this is a sign of a great week to come!
Im glad they won!
Were the opposing team a really tough one?
Oh I bet you enjoyed that
I bet you will
I am sorry why didnt he come?
I bet he hated missing it too! Work is good for bills but it interferes a lot with life
That is not good. I am glad they are okay though
I would be too
You seem a bit jealous.
You should talk to your friend about it. 
How precious!  How old is she now?  What does the ornament look like?
What a wonderful nostalgic piece.  My daughter is 8 and growing up way too fast.  I have a hand print ornament she made and I cant believe one day shell be 13!
Thats awesome. What subject was it?
History is one my favorites as well!
Thats bad timing for sure
Well at least they got out
You are a good parent.  How do you have space for it all?
I guess youll have to get a storage unit.  The question then is what goes in the storage unit?  Furniture or the kids crafts.  Haha.
Thats always a plus
That happens to me too. I go to the store almost every day
Does he live far away?
That makes sense. Did you have fun?
What movie is it
Well as long as they love it
That sounds amazing!   What do you have planned?
That sounds great!
Thats so neat when friendships last so long.
I am sure you guys have a great bond and many fun memories.
No one came to take care of you?
Was the cat nice? I know they can be sassy when they dont get all of the attention lol
Healthy is important
I guess but they can always teach them
Oh wow you must have been thrilled!
Thats great when someone you love puts in the extra effort to be there for you
Thats not good I remember bad times at school. What happened?
One good friend who you can trust is better than a bunch you cant. Its just part of growing up sometimes. School can be an exercise in mental strength.
Yes I hope she can find her self worth in who she is. Its just part of growing up. Its hard
What kind of birds are they?
Thats so sweet of you.
That can be one of the hardest parts of life. Very tough
How did it go? Is it college?
I am sorry roommates can be annoying sometimes
I will not either
Ah! Thats kind of a scary thought but I bet that would also be kind of fun. I live in a city with a very extensive history that is utilized a lot in haunted trips and stuff like that so I have seen them around and have wondered about going on one. Do you believe in ghosts?
Yeah I can totally understand that. It can be exhilarating and a different experience I would imagine. But I would understand that you wouldnt want to have to deal with the after effects. I never have trouble with nightmares so I dont worry about that. As for me Im still on the fence about ghosts.
Thats really too bad. I know how that feels. Have you tried telling her how you feel about it?
That must be really difficult and lonely for you. I hope you guys can get something figured out.
Sounds like a good kid. What has he been working on.
Thats great! How old is he?
That is nice of you.  Where has he been?
that is really nice of you
Sometimes you gotta stand up for yourself.
If they know you they should know better.
Talk about an unwelcome guest! I would have immediately slammed my door shut! I never know how to respond in those situations as in whether or not theyre dangerous etc. What did you do?
I did not expect that kind of reaction! But I guess I dont know enough about possums. Maybe that makes sense. I compare them almost to raccoons who Ive seen be very aggressive. Well it looks you made a new friend. I hope you named them!
You are so lucky!
I know exactly what you mean. Someone returned my purse at the casino once. It still had my money in it!
That must be incredibly annoying to have to deal with. To constantly have to battle for what you feel is justified support and to always be worrying about it in the back of your head. You have to be really resilient to go through that.
Wow.. Thats almost noble. I hope youre able to still properly survive without it especially since its unfair that youre not getting it in the first place. Im sorry youre being put in that position. One day Im sure your children will recognize and appreciate you had to go through for them.
Dont be too hard on yourself. You taught yourself a lesson for next time.
Im in college I understand. Just have to keep pushing forward and youll so great
Oh no.  I have experienced that before and its not pleasant.  Its hard to be kind and careful with your speech and actions when youre near a snob.
Seriously!  I just keep thinking that they are a person just like me and it doesnt always means they are better than me just because they are entitled.  As they say everyone puts their pants on one leg at a time.
Ugh! So you have corrupt police officers in your town too? That is a bummer!
I would too! Most officers dont show up for that.
Your mom is awesome
Maybe you should go on a trip together
Oh yeah? That sounds awesome. Thats how it should be! Can you tell me a little bit about them?
Haha thats incredible. A lot of parents wouldnt feel that way... After 18 theyre done. Thats pretty cool of you to feel that way but I guess that speaks volumes about the kind of kids you have and how good they are. It sounds like you raised them right.
I hops so too! Work does come first or the bills cant be paid! 
What kind of birthday are you having?
Wow! Enjoy it! What did you accomplish if I may ask?
That is something that is a dream! Enjoy it so much! congrats
I am so sorry to hear that.  When will you see them again?
That is so sad to hear.  I hope things go well with the therapy and you are reunited soon.
Theres absolutely nothing I can say to make you feel better about that. Im sorry for your great losses. Just from those few sentences alone I can tell you were very passionate about them. What were their names if you dont mind me asking?
Those are great names! And that does sound like a good idea as long as youre comfortable with it. Its such a tenuous situation.. to want another pet to fill the void but to be scared that you will be disappointed when they dont live up to their predecessors. My girlfriend will be in the same situation when her dog passes. Shes already getting nervous since her dog is 10yearsold.
Oh gross!  Ive heard of flies or ants being in an ear but a roach?  That gives me chills because I hate roaches sooooo much.  Now I might have nightmares tonight!
EW!  I might start sleeping with ear plugs in now too.  Ive heard you eat 8 spiders on average in a lifetime some in your sleep.  So many things to be scared of with bugs! Im so glad they were able to get it out.  Tell her I hope she gets over the trauma of it okay.
Oh my god! I have done something similar before. I dont get embarrassed easy but I know such things do sting a bit!
That is terrible
Police here do that sometimes. It sucks.
I can imagine that. Ive never lived alone before.
When did you start living by yourself?
That is great! Being without a job can be very scary
What kind of job is it?
Yu should report him
Well thats what I mean. I hate when people take advantage of others
Oh that could be tough sometimes. Im glad you were able to get all the ones you wanted.
Its all behind you now.
My neighbors are terrible so I hope you have a good relationship
I actually had some move in a couple of days ago. I have figured them out yet lol
That is doing something. Its what we call relaxing.
Have you been busy lately?
That happens over time
I wonder what my old school looks like now
You should check if they raised your rates unexpectedly or maybe something you bought is eating up a lot of electricity.
Thats terrible what did you do?
I hope he learned his lesson.
yes! Yin and yang its hard to appreciate the quiet without the loud 
Remember to cherish them as we can all go at any minute 
Oh I love cleaning so tools to do it with that are new are always welcomed. What kind of brand?
A Hoover seems like a reliable choice. My girlfriend is a neat freak and decided to go with a big purchase a Dyson which is more expensive. Ive used it and its not bad. Still not sure Id pay as much as she did for a vacuum cleaner but who am I to argue. Anyway Im happy for you.
Woah! Im soooo glad youre okay!  Those big rigs are so dangerous and make me so nervous.  I stay as far away from them as I can.
Well thats understandable.  Ive had two kids of my own and labor would not be fun in the car.  Was she in shock when you guys were almost hit?
I completely understand that.  Things are always scary when it is happening to your kids but there is hope!  Have you ever heard of whole foods plant based diet?  Or doctor Fuhrman or doctor Michael Greger?  I think it could heal your son!
You will likely never hear about any of this stuff in a doctors office but it can heal almost anything!  I hope your son is better before the end of summer.  Keep hope alive!
What happened to it?
What are they doing?
Oh lol Well it
Sorry! I meant that kids do that enjoy it mom while they are little 
I feel sorr for the poor guy!
Yea theyre his parents. I can imagine everyone being hesitant about telling them what not to do with their own child.
Thats nice of you to say about someone else. Its nice when someone can recognize someone elses hard work and dedication without feeling jealous or annoyed. Im sure he knows how proud of him you are.
Thats a good way to look at it to use them as motivation and a goal to strive for. Are you in school yourself or just working?
Oops.  Thats doesnt have to be a bad thing.  No one can resist fries from McDonalds.  How did she react?
Well there you go.  She enjoyed it and if she didnt complain or scoff at you then she sounds like a keeper!
You must really miss him! So glad youll finally be reunited with him.
Oh you have kids too? Theyre going to be so happy!
Ive never done that before.
I bet its fun. I cant swim though
IT? Havent heard of it. Whats it about?
Are you thinking about telling her you dont want to see it?
Thats a great idea!  For what cause though?
That is very thoughtful of you.
Oh no. That has happened to us so many times. I thought fidh were easy
Wow. Im sorry
People can be inconsiderate sometimes. I hope you dont get sick!
Thats true. Its nice of you to put yourself in their shoes.
Oh man Costco pizza is great and so cheap too. It may not be the best but for the price and quantity you cant really beat it. Do you like shopping at Costco often?
Yeah I guess it depends on your household. I just tag along with my parents from time to time to get certain things in bulk. But I think you need to have a certain amount of people in your family for it to be worth the membership. Still I really appreciate the business and the owner as a whole.
That was so nice of you.  What did they need to use it for?  Were you able to live without it?
What?!! Thats terrible.  I dont understand how people dont take care of things that dont belong to them when its a privilege to use borrowed things.  
That is terrible. Some people ar just no good.
I hate that happened to you. I know the feeling too. Someone stole my car from the work parking lot once. I had just soent over 1500 getting things fixed on it.
Family conflict is always hard.  Maybe you dont need to take a side and try to work for peace.
It is rarely easy to know the right thing to do in these sorts of situations.  This might be a situation that calls for some professional help.
Whoa! Was that a good surprise or a bad surprise? I could see that going either way but at least it would be exciting! I had that happen when I got one for Christmas. Well actually it was in my parents bed and I barged into their room to ask if we could go downstairs and open presents and I saw the one they had gotten me and had been hiding to surprise me with.
Thats pretty cool! I hope everything goes well with the training and raising of it. Your wife sounds really cool to do that for you.
Did you call her? I hope shes ok!
Im glad youre going to talk about it instead of being passive aggressive about it.
Oh thats kind of nice. Its nice to have those natural landmarks near where you live so you can visit them and get a sense of relaxation and peace. Ive lived near the ocean all my life and while I do take it for granted from time to time I try to remember how useful and beautiful it is.
Sometimes it means increased work commute or higher costs of living. But sometimes that can be worth it in terms of the health benefits and lifestyle improvements that come along with it. Its all a balance. Im glad you seem to have found yours!
that is awesome! 
It will save you a lot of money too
Oh nice. What will you be binge watching?
Hope you find something you like.
She will do great. OR she might not want to have kids be he is such a handful
Lids today are so picky about everything. Its sort of strange. Its nothing like when I was growing up
Thats terrible. Sometimes its hard to know who your real friends are and it takes repeated attempts to hang out with them only to have them bail on you to realize that youre not valued by them. I say cut your ties sooner rather than later. Lifes too short.
Oh man... When you consider all that then yeah definitely cut ties. If they did that to me more than twice then I would realize really quick that they werent the type to depend on or waste time on. I feel sorry for you. People should have friends that recognize their worth and be able to respect that relationship. Go out and find you someone who will.
Wow that sounds exciting!
I love a good rock concert!
Oh god. Someone did pick up their dogs poop hu?
It mustve been. I hope that never happens to you again.
I bet it did.
Not too many of those around nowadays
oh that was good of you.
oh haha i know that feeling.
thats a good idea.
Thats a bummer
Nice. Are you excited?
I hope its what you expected to be!
That is so sweet of your cat.
Well I hope you get better soon.
Oh sweet. Sin city! What do you look forward to doing?
Oh yea. I heard the buffets there are amazing.
Good for you.You are an exampler brother.
That is so hard to imagine.She will need all the help she can get from you.
That is great to hear.  Anything in particular?
Cthat sounds amazing!
Oh god thats terrifying haha. I hate snakes.
I know what you mean they are cool to look at but if they are near me it spooks me hard.
Thats tough. I have two older brothers so I know how that is. Were separated by four and eight years respectively so we werent as close as you two seem to be but I always liked having them around.
Well absence always does make the heart grow fonder. It will make your relationship a little strained but the time you guys do get to spend together maybe will mean more and you can enjoy it more. Hopefully his college work doesnt stress him out too much for him to be able to enjoy hanging out.
Your husband sounds awesome. Thats interesting that youre the type of person that actually likes birthday parties. Most people I know would be too embarrassed or selfconscious to enjoy them and theyd feel uncomfortable. Especially me. But for you Im glad you can get into them. 
Oh I didnt mean anything about the age! Who cares about that. Im just a doofus when it comes to social interaction so I get nervous and avoid things that put attention on me. But I hope you have a lot of fun especially since your husband went through so much effort. I bet he knows you and what you like well and it will be great.
Oh no!  My gut feels sick for you having to go through that.  It happens to all of us but its so painful and awkward.  How did the neighbors take it?
Its so commendable that you went over and told them right away.  Not everyone would do that.  Your actions increases my faith in the goodness of people.
That is cool.  When did you learn?
That is awesome
Oh thats rare. How come?
Oh now I see lol. Whos your favorite team?
Oh wow thats nice of you! What kind?

Wellif he really is your friend you shouldnt.

Did you miss someone or a place maybe.?
I am sorry to hear that.I am sure he is in a better place.

I can sympathize with you.
Congratulations.You must be very proud of her.
I am sure she will graduate with honors and get a great job
That is not good. What seems to be the cause?
I am so sorry. That must be very difficult.
Oh really? Why would you be scared?
I see. A war would be horrible.
I am sorry to hear that.What is the reason for this?
I am sorry to hear that.Do you have full cover insurance.
that really sucks i dont know the feeling tho.
she sounds like a rude person.
Oh thats cool how long did the graduation last?
Thats a little annoying since you just have to sit there and wait for it to end haha.
That is cool sounds like a good time.
I totally agree with you. Hes great!
I can not disagree with you.
I am sorry to hear that.We you expecting somthing very expensive?
Did you get in touch with  the postal office?
oh thats a weird thing to say.
saying you are scary is weird tho???
I am sorry to hear that.Following a diet is very stresffull.
You probably need to get more motivated.
Im so sorry.  Will you be okay?
I hope you will feel better.
Do you watch any other shows?
Will you be hosting a Thanksgiving party at your home?
Does your Mothers house have any animals?
When did you find out?
I guess she didnt get a cat then.
It is good to stay informed.
I am glad people still pay attention to the outside world.
That is very bad you should return it.
When did you do it?
Thats good. What kind of parade was it?
Oh my gosh! I would have been so mad. Did you call them and complain? They need to fix it.
That is a good thing. I am sure you are a great mom.
I do have kids. Being a mom can be hard but it is so rewarding.
Thats a shame you shouldnt have to do that.
Things will get better soon.
Did you call the manager and complain?
You should of called and told them.
Im sorry how do you feel?
I hope you can forgive yourself.
Do you talk softly?
You should tell them.
It is great to have a brother you can count.
I am sure he can also count on you for everything
How long have you been married?
Do you have any children?
I am sure you looked just fine.
I am sure it was not that bad.
Did you take the offer?
That was nice of him.
Oh no that is horrible. Is he okay?
I hope he can do so quickly!
Why do you feel at peace?
What did you do with them?
wow thats crazy.
i bet it was with something like that.
I am so happy for you!

I think he is doing a great job.
No I am well educated. He lowered taxes. 
Really?.You are a loser
You should better yourself and fix this situation.
That is very nice of her.
Thats nice you can rely on her.
That wasnt very nice.
You should return it.
Oh wow thats exciting!
Im also going to college in the fall but Im gonna be a sophomore.
How did she dump you?
Will you still be friends with her?
oh wow that is awesome.
yea i bet it does.
Did she not get it?
Will she apply elsewhere?
It is unacceptable for a friendship. I think you should not behave in such a way ever again
You should. You must immediately let your friend know and apologize for your behavior
That is a very nice gesture by them.
You must have some great people in your life.
You should sue them.
Oh no what did you steal?
That is not right.  Do you feel bad?
Really? Thats amazing what words?
Thats really exciting Im happy for you.
Did they laugh at you?
oh thats so cool.
i bet you were so happy.
That was smart of you.
You would be a good planner.
Did you do it in person?
You should of done it in person.
Dont worry you will be fine.
Just have faith and everything will work out.
That is good that you are happy about his efforts. 
I guess it depends on what the next couple of years hold.
That is nice of them.
You are well prepared.
Thats good. Anything special happening?
Ah so you feel confident about it?
When is she coming?
How long is she staying?
Ive never had to do it before have you?
Im sure it was I hope the next time isnt as bad for you.
Did you expect it?
There are other girls out there.
When do you get the grade?
Im sorry why did you get fired?
Things will work out if you stay positive.
Do you live in a place where it regularly rains? 
As it is summer i was a bit surprised to see raining in your place
oh my gosh i completely agree on the loneliness thing
i dont to be honest just try to get through the day but ive never been in a relationship so it gets bad
oh my was it worth it?
what a joke! are you going to sue?
Thats okay she will forgive you.
What did you do with it?
I have never played that game.
How old are you
Oh damn you had cancer before?
Im sure it was hopefully its gone for good.
oh yea im the same gonna be wild.
oh thats awesome you are a good person we need more booze people
Did you watch TV?
What do you watch on netflix?
I love it too! Its really fancy.
I know right! Its weird how its faster than a gasoline car.
Did you run away?
Did you kill it?
Is this your first home?
How big is the house?
Good for you. Many are getting into car loan and struggling with car payments
You should be grateful for having such a caring father
I hope you do too!
Hard work always pays off.
Will he let you drive it?
That is so sweet of you I am sure that makes her so happy.
You are making memories that will last a lifetime.
What are you going to do while he is away?
Will you be able to call him?
oh thats a very big position.

Are you going to accept the invite?
I wish I was also tall. It must be nice.
That would be very helpful.
How long did you have it for?
Can you buy a new one?
I am sure your hard work will pay off!
It is always a good thing to stay optimistic.
That is wonderful. Is he now considering going to college?
Good for him. Has he taken any SAT tests yet?
Im sorry are you jealous?
You will find a good career.
Did they have permission to take it?
I hope you can learn to forgive them for it. 
oh no! did you block your cards?
what are you going to do about it?
Im happy about that. Got a party planned?
You seem very excited. I hope it turns out the way you want it to.
eww thats awful.
i bet it was.
That sounds like fun!
Im sure you had a good time!
That sounds like you were confident in your decision. Did you think it through?
That sounds like you were happy with the decision that you made. 
Why your parents? Cant you buy it yourself all on your own like a grown ups?
I am sorry to hear that. I think you should join your parents when they go shopping for a pet to a store
I really love those types of shows. Remember what it was called?
Oh cool Ive never watched that one before!
Physics is an interesting subject but it can get difficult to understand sometimes.
Hopefully you wont have to take an additional Physics course in the future!
Well thats not very nice! Whyd you do that?!
I would sure hope so! That poor kid.
That sounds like a fun project!
Patience is always a good thing.
Why did you have to do that?
Oh I bet that was embarrassing. I have had that happen too.
When and where is his first solo concert?
Fantastic I imagine you must be so proud.
oh that really suckks.

That sounds like a fun night.
I am happy for you.
did he get you?
they do look a little scary! 
Oh thats great good work.
oh yea i work out a lot and im no where close so you must work hard
Did you do it on purpose?
Youve got to be careful that can cause a very serious accident!
It will be
Are you okay?
Im glad you didnt get hurt.
oh no. are you at an elevated area?
always good to be prepared
Congrats! That is a good feeling.
Your hard work is paying off! Keep it up.
Im afraid of public speaking or performing in crowds so that takes courage! How did it go?
Thats great! You have to keep a good attitude about it. I hope you get the part you want!
can you even find one like that now?
definitely good old days!
Thats really impressive! Education is really important.
Thats cool. Its good to be supportive of your friends.
thats scary i hate that stuff.
haha thats quite funny
I am sure it does. It is same for me. I was also raised in the 90s.
Yes it was. I miss that time in my life.
That sounds amazing! I love it when families adopt and give a loving child a home.
Thats so sweet!! I see you said she was a baby but how old is she currently? 
Oh cool! What part of Texas were you going to check out?
Yes the beaches there would be really fun to go explore. Plus lots of sight seeing!
thats horrible so sad 
i bet it is so sad.
thats nice of you but so hard to deal with
Thats good to hear hes doing so well. Did you have a lot of input?
Teachers? Well its not always the case. I never let school interfere with my education
Is there something specific that you are scared about?
Slow down. Do not jump into such conclusions so fast. I highly recommend you to immediately reach out to a doctor
Really.Did anybody get hurt.
Do you have full cover on you car?
So sorry to hear that. Its not easy
Well done. Im sure shell appreciate it
That does sound boring because you had no one to interact with but at least you had some privacy.
I see. It would be quite lonely without a roommate to share the experience with.
thats so nice of you.
i bet it is.
I have never had an accident. Been driving for 22 years now
Trash cans? How odd. Maybe you should complain to the city
Maybe it is your imagination.The were probably catching up.
You should not be so insecure about your partner.It is not healthy.
It seems under Trump the economy is booming as he promised
Indeed. Many thought that way but he actually delivered on his promises
That is sad. Did he pass away?
I bet it does. I am so sorry. Try to think of all the good times with him.
Did she.How did it go?
Congratulations.You probably are very proud of her.
Me either  they have done so much for me in my life.
wow thats so nice.  there are alot of people in life who have no one.
Yes there are. It is so sad.
It is difficult when we all have busy lives and limited resources.
oh no. how many people do you think noticed?
funny how nobody told you about it
I bet that is really enjoyable. Are you going anywhere fun?
Have fun! That sounds like a great time.
Oh that sounds rough. Were you successful?
Thats great! Im happy for you. I hope you get along real well
Sounds rough. Did it do any major damage?
Good! Im glad it worked out for you guys at least
You must have been overjoyed. I know what he meant to you.
Be sure and put it in a safe place.
Well thats not right no matter what your excuse because now youre not trustworthy see
Its better to end things than to wait for years. Dont waste any more time like I did. 4 years
Thats always good to hear. Whats going on?
That sounds like a fun time! Enjoy!
That sounds like it is exciting but also a lot of work. 
Wow how kind of her! You are lucky to have such a good mom.
wow And did you ever end up finishing the project?
I see  what did you do instead
Sometimes I do
Im not sure what you mean but disntance does tend to make things more difficult
Thats hard but he will be back! Try to take your mind off him by doing some fun activities
Thats horrible!  This is why they say never a lender nor a borrower be..
I hope it wasnt a lot of money.  Sometimes it takes a hard lesson to learn whom to let in your life.
Sorry to hear.  Will you be planning anything special?
If you have other family member around you ask around and get everyone involved.  It should be nice.
I bet that was a nice surprise.
That is so cool. 
Wow how are you adjusting?
Have you tried to go out and make friends?
Im so sorry to hear that. I love my dog
He can live on in memories perhaps
did you like what she bought?
Really? That is a crazy thing to do
Did anything happen to him?
Im sorry to hear that. Did you have the files backed up at all?
Wow thats so lucky! I should do that as well just in case!
Aw thats adorable! I bet hes the cutest thing
Thats awesome. I want a baby nephew 
I can understand your feelings. Thats a tough situation.
That is good that you trust him but temptation is never good for anyone.
Thats really tough.  But one closed door leads to the next great opportunity.
Thats horrible!  If you dont have insurance there are a lot of pro bono lawyers that will take your case.  Report it to the police so it is documented and justice will prevail.  You dont deserve or need to put up with that.
What a nice gift! My little brother did the same for me actually. Xbox one S last year
Oh yes. Got like 400 games on it.
Knew who exactly?
Someone randomly walked up to you and kissed you? Thats odd
Really? Why did you do that?
When will she be returning?
How are you keeping yourself occupied?
Wow that sounds like a lot of fun!
What was your favorite part of the trip?
Oh yeah? What is it?
Oh my days lol. Thats a classic. I like 2 stupid dogs myself
Has she taught him to sit?
wow she must be a really good dog owner is this her first?
That had to make you feel good. It is so easy to forget when your trying so hard to remember. LOL
I always make a list before a trip and triple check it before I leave.
Thats terrible!  How did you find out?
Its hard to find forgiveness for something like that.  Still its better that he confessed than you having to find out otherwise.  If only a little better
Congratulation. How it went?
That is very nice. Congratulation.
Oh no! I hate that happened and I bet it was scary because it looked like someone broke in. But now you have a repair bill. Sorry that happened to you.
I hope the persons conscience makes them feel guilty and they come clean about the situation! And hopefully reimburse you!
Sounds like fun. What you got planned ?
Got any family out there? Cousins perhaps
What kind is it Cuban?
Cool I like those but they are crazy expensive if you want a thick one.
Why you dont invite a friend to come with you?
Why dont you take a guide or a book to help visit?
Oh no I am so sorry. Did you have flood insurance at least?
Did you lose anything you cant replace? Important documents or pictures? Must be some bright light.
i bet sounds like it would be nice.
yea but exams can still really suckk
Movies can be emotional do you remember the film?
Thats a good movie. Yes time really goes by fast and those memories remind us of the good times.
Did succeed at anything?
Wow thats so cool! Which comics were they?
Oh yeah that would be such a fun find!
Sweet where abouts are you going?
No doubt do you have a tour guide or is it just free for you to roam about?
What about 5?
I still have no idea what do you mean?
Oh god thats awful! Is she alright?
That would make sense assuming she is getting pretty old.
Oh no did she say something really upsetting?
Oh thats the worst...I wish people would just say what they want to say
oh do you have summer classes?
eh its not bad its quite productive 
Man that sounds like the dream. Watching anything good?
The British version of the U.S. version? 
Not my pick but I am glad you get a laugh out of it.
Oh my gosh. Why did your pants fall?
Were you able to laugh it off or were you so mortified you wanted to crawl out of the room?
I understand. Were you able to manage the situation?
It is ok. It was a scary situation.
What kind of problems?
Do you have enough time for it?
Why what did he tell you?
She must really be a good friend how are you repaying here?
Is it a type of work youve been wanting to get into for a while?
Wow engineering sounds impressive.  Im sure the income will be awesome.
That sounds great! What are you growing?
That sounds delicious and healthy also.
Its nice to be able to look back. It can really give you perspective on your life now.
That is so true. After all we cant change the past only learn from it.
Why would they do such a thing?
That is so bad the police should be called for that.
Those kind of thing happened from time to time.
oh yea i know the feeling
oof thats harsh i feel for you
yea its insane that hes a political figure
yea and immigarants
That is disgusting What did you do to clean it?
Did the smell went away?
Family members are awesome what was the situation? 
I am glad everything turned out alright!
I bet you are happy as never before.
You are lucky that your girlfriend is a gamer.
Good for them for taking the initiative and helping the family.
You must of done something right in raising them. 
Why would you do such a thing?!
That is unacceptable find a job!
Thats great. What made you feel that.
Thats a great feeling I dont like having any kind of bill anyway.
Did you got the grade?
That is nice. Congratulation.
oh thats nice
That is so weird maybe try contacting them and see what happened. Sorry to hear.
Oh no. Did it run off or stay close by?
Hopefully he didnt get hurt. It might be time to put a lock on the gate.
who saved you?
well that was observant of her.. sometimes people dont even notice 
I bet you were happy
That is always nice
What was the name of the movie?
I know this movie but it seems a nice movie. What did it reminded you from your childhood?
What did you do
I am not sure what you picked up
wow thats nice

I wish you luck in that the chances of winning the lottery are super slim!

That has been fun
That is very nice of your aunt. What kind of laptop was it?
I have dells are really reliable!

oh wow i couldnt even imagine
I hope you were no too upset.  The odd of winning are super low!
That is a good outlook to have.  A little chance is better than no chance!
Aw really? He is a great player anyways
Hopefully he continues his streak at LA as well
Hopefully so he is not making it easy for them or anyone!
Apparently everyone is our enemy now how sad!

I would have to loved to see that btw! Do you dance with friends or alone?
I can understand that. You are more passionate than others
Try not to be too envious!  What kind of car is it that you want so bad?
I guess you can just start trying to save for it.  Dont be jealous or it will eat you up inside!
I understand how you feel. I wonder how those people afford it.
Im sure if you work hard you could afford it too.
oh no.. what happened?
Sorry to hear that my friend. I hope things work out for you at work soon enough

I really hope you get it buddy
Sorry to hear that.. Did you miss something important?
Oh shoot.. I wish you get to go soon enough buddy

Alright anyways good for you!
No I missed it but I do usually watch UFC fights!  Were there quick knock outs?
Knock outs are the best!  When was UFC established?  I feel like it was been around for a while!
That is insane.  You might want to take it elsewhere.
The prices have risen alot with all the technology and electrical components.
Oh no. I cant imagine not having AC in this heat.
I hope you can get it fixed easily. I know they are not cheap to replace.
Good reason to be scared.  What steps are you both taking to increase security?
A good sound plan.  Youre right it is a fathers responsibility to protect his family.
I found a bunch of dead mice few days ago
Haha.. thats a really funny story!
That sounds like a nice plan.  Do you often get the chance to take days off?
Ive been thinking of forcing myself to take time off.  We all need a break from time to time.
Friends and UFC sounds like a great night!  I missed the fight.  Were there any good knock outs?
Awesome!  Was that who you were hoping would win?
I hope you get it too!  Best of luck!  We all could use extra money in the pocket!
Sounds promising.  Are you coming out of long dry spell?
Thats pretty short.  I went 7 years.  Decided the next girl I met Id marry we just celebrated 13 years toghether.

I know your pain. I used to have to stay over often as well.

Oh that is a smart move I would have been just as scare
and... ?  what is going on?
Oh ok.. I was scared for a minute there.  Congratulations on your successful relationship! LOL
I know what you mean. My family is the only thing that keeps me going.
Its tough but hey at least its something.

i hope so
I completely understand. Cant live with them cant live without them.  ha ha ha
How long you been together?
What fight did you watch?
Ah did he win?
I am the black sheep in mine self declared.
No he didnt.. but at least they were admitting they were assholes you didnt have to wait till you were older to figure it out.

How rude!  Are you two roommates?
What was it that he ate?
Yes I love combat sports.
Dillishaw is a warrior  Do you think very highly of connor?
I am sorry to hear that I lost my grandmother to cancer which did not make it anny better knowing it was coming
I know it is sad that people must pass but I am grateful for the time I did get with her
Ive always wanted a nintendo switch Is it any good?
How often do you play portably?
Yeah kids have moved on to YuGiYoh and other silly games.
At least pokemon go is popular now..
Wow that should be interesting have fun!
did you kill it ?
Why what happened?
That makes sense you gotta prepare for that my man you know how that goes!
I love the switch I have been thinking about buying my own.
Would you say you play it more at home or on the go?
That is amazing what breed was it?
That is so great did you keep it?
thats good that you trust her! Its hard to have a relationship if you dont have trust
i agree! Ive been married for 5 years and i cant imagine being with anyone else but my wife
That is good it can be easy to sink into a bad lifestyle with a kid or stressed wife
That makes sense too that is all I eat now my metabolism may catch me one day I need to make changes as well but great for you losing the weight!
I do that too.. I take small tiny ones usually.  I have pieces of the grandcanyon and everything
Sometimes but I like natural cool stuff better and making collages out of brochures and free stuff I find along the way.
WHAT?! do you hear noises at night?
Oh my god I have lived in a haunted house before  what do you smell?

What happened? did you run into traffic?
That is no fun  was his coach upset he was late or did you even make it at all?
NO! they can be vermin  what did you do to get rid of him?
Did he jump up and run away?
That was nice of him..  Did you pay him back ever
THats really nice of you!  Was he surprised?
WHAT? I would be terrified!! 
So you actually saw it?? how did it look? did it say anything?
Has she tried to lie before but just been a terrible liar?
I am the same way Every time I lie im thinking.  they dont believe me at all
thats good. did it actually turn out easy?
thats wonderful! Congrats! I didnt have a lot of easy classes when i was in college
Moving to a new place can make you uneasy but once you make a couple of friends youll get over it. 
New York is very beautiful and the people there are very friendly so im sure youll do fine. 
Oh wow!  What happened?  
That stinks.  What did you do with your tickets?
why not? if it will possibly get you better
might as well find out now before it get worse
Good luck. Thats always nerve racking waiting for them to call. Im sure you did well though.
That is really exciting. I bet since you have a good feeling they will call back.
What band is that?
They playing anywhere close?
thats good.. any plans
how long have you been driving
ah thats cool
Wait what happened?
How did he manage to open the gate?
Thats good new experiences can lead to new likes and dislikes. The important thing is that you keep an open mind. 
Exactly hopefully you found a new hobby.
That was really nice of them and lucky they were able to help you.
Congratulations on graduating college and I wish you the very best.
Thats cool! Do you play basketball frequently?
I feel the same. I used to be pretty athletic but now I take in most sports from the comfort of my sofa!
I would try again if you love her you might regret not giving it another try if she moves on.
Sounds like a good idea to go slow and make sure things dont get too heavy too fast.
I dont have kids either sometimes when i go out with my friends im mainly the 3rd wheel and it feels weird  i feel your pain
Thats exactly how i feel i have hanged out with them and its always kids crying and running around
Great! Will this mean a lower car payment for you? 
So happy for you! Yes having extra money is always a reason to celebrate!
Did you guys ever fall out?
Wow its always the people that your closest to that end up changing.
That must have been so frustrating!!! Were you able to find them fairly quickly? And how?!
SO frustrating. Hopefully you were able to provide feedback to the owner. Not sure they couldcan do anything about it but still  maybe youve helped pay it forward to the next visitor!
Thats terrific! Is there anything in particular that makes you feel good about it?
But on a personal level how do you experience that?
Language barriers can be pretty problematic. Always keep an open ear though.
Thats fair. The same would be true in any other nation.
You are so lucky! I love the Caribbean but I have never been to Barbados. Have you been there before?
Saint Lucia is absolutely beautiful. You were very lucky to go there.
Try to relax and think positive visualize yourself acing the test.
You are being to negative.Whit this attitude you are gonna fail for sure
It seems he is delivering on his promises. As you can see the economic numbers are truly high
I think the tax cuts has made investors bullish on capital investment which Trump administration has passed as a law
Nice I bet you feel so relieved!
I agree second chances are awesome. They always surprise me because I dont expect much after the first chance.
Oh wow I bet thats scary. Maybe theres something you could look into to help prevent that happening that does not sound fun!
I agree get those things OUT! I hope they never come back!
oh when and why?
oh my condolences for you you would have good memories of it.
Ha! Ive always loved the more festive Dia de los Muertos approach to the day rather than scare or gore! Whats your favorite Halloween film?
SAME. Because when it came out it felt groundbreaking! I remember being soooo scared and jumpy for weeks after seeing that.
I did not know that it was that high! Thats amazing.
I guess so and I am not even a Trump supporter.
I bet that disturbing and frightening when you have to see those. Especially when the thought of them is always lingering!
Hopefully you dont wake up and ruin your sleep over them too often.
Nice! You sound like you prepared very well
I love that feeling. Being prepared for whatever comes your way good luck!
it definetly is. Im glad schools are taking a stance against it
it definetly is. I hope we move forward to eliminate this issue
Sounds a bit scary.  What did you do?
Oh my goodness I would have been terrified!
Thankfully he walked on past you but what a horrible experience all round.
Making music is a hard business to break into. The only way to make it is to keep practicing and to get a little lucky.
Even if nothing ever comes of music youre still having fun I hope! Thats really what music is supposed to be about anyways. Making a few million is always a nice bonus though!
Of course. Good luck with the music career. Im rooting for you
Wow thats awesome and great that youre supporting her also.
What course or field?
Oh my I hope you are ok.
Cool do you like older cars?
Was there any bikes there too?
Oh wow. I bet that was amazing!
I bet the weather was nice too!
oh that sounds good 
ya you should and you be proud of your achievement 
Thats a wild occurrence. Jail can be harsh on anyone.
Yeah thats definitely the way to go. Get out as fast as possible.
Oh no! Thats disgusting. They should take better care of him.
I would have been nauseous too.
Is bed rest where you stop working?
Me too. If she gets plenty of rest the baby will be just fine.
sounds like a lot of waiting. did you do well?
very frustating but congratulations on the results
Hey thats good I hope both do a lot of catching up 😊
I havent been to the zoo in a long time I hope you have fun.
Oh man did you have plenty of food and water?
Dang well its a good thing that you made it out okay!
Dont worry I do that all the time. I love binge eating lol
True but chips taste sooo much better
Its awful when you spend money on tickets and popcorn and its a bad time. Did they put all of the best moments in the trailer?
I would be so annoyed. You could have stayed home and watched Twitch.
Thats great! I hope you perform well and have a wonderful time. What is your profession?
Just take a few deep breathes and be confident!
That sounds like a great deal. Get the money and do something great with it.
Hopefully all goes well. We could use a little cash.
I have not seen any UFC movies. I guess I should watch one to give them a chance.
Who are some of your favorite fighters?
Thats terrible maybe getting out of the house and checking out our yard sale will cheer you up. 
no problem! Hope to see you 
Thats unfortunate. I have experienced similar things. I hope that she comes back around.
Yeah it is. But just realize that you are not the one acting weird.
Nice! Usually Mondays suck but not for you! You are so lucky
Make the best of it! 
Ugh I am with you on that. Mine has been doing that all week. Its so annoying and it costs even more to switch to someone else
Sometimes resetting the modem  router helps. But it wont do much if the ISP isnt good to begin with. Careful with going too cheap though you might end up worse
Every adult has some nostalgic feelings of becoming a child again. Adult responsibilities are overwhelming
Indeed. Growing up i now realize how much my parents have sacrificed in order to provide for me
Good luck! Hard work always pays off. 
Yes you will coquer that exam!
Thats great! What strategies are you using?
Have you heard of the ketogenic diet? I am thinking about going on it.
It is one where fats are 75 of the diet protein is 20 and carbohydrates are 5. Its very difficult to do but I think I am going to do it. You should look it up to see what it is all about
Thats probably true but who knows in this country.
I hope so. I think he will be out but apparently his approval rating has gone up.
Awe I am so sorry to hear that.  What happened?
I imagine so.  The holidays are the times we really miss those who are no longer with us.  I hope in time though you can remember the happy times and the good memories you have made with her over the years.
LOVE the mountains. Mainly in the New Mexico  Colorado area  but also to the Alps. How about you?
Lovely! Did you ski or sled? Sledding is a whoooooole different animal there!
That is such a bummer. Summer is an expensive time to travel. I went to Ireland in July but I bought the tickets in March so they were pretty cheap. 
Oh that is so frustrating. Im sorry to hear that. I am a travel agent flight prices fluctuate by the hour keep watching they might go back down. 
Thats exciting!  I cant imagine getting upset over a surprise trip though!
I would be thrilled!  I think its a great idea
Thats probably great for your body and fitness.
Thats great. Keep up the wonderful work. Do you diet well too?
Uh oh. For fun or you needed it for something?
Oh I see. Well we all think differently about things we reflect on later. Use it as a personal lesson for other things in life
well something must have gone wrong somehow I think you should talk to your vet doctor
Yes I think you can try chaining it
oh that was so sad.dont fed up.you have to go through this problem
please dont worry .you have to be so confident in these times.keep going whatever happens
thats my duty friend.you have the power to defeat your problems.make it soon
Wow what the heck. Tell your chief it was your assistant who did it
That is absolutely amazing. That could be an inspiration to so many different people.
You know that almost sounds like that could be a movie. There are so many people caught up with drugs today in the United States and around the world
Oh Im so sorry! Do you want to talk about it?
Argh! Was it an accident of some kind? I hope YOU are okay!
I love them too. What kind of dog do you have?
Awww I bet they are. I dont have a dog right now but I want one. I just dont know what breed yet.
Wow that is messed up. Why did your boss change mind so suddenly?
I guess that makes sense but still. I would have been furious and let them know I had a vacation planned.
Try to put yourself out there!  You can also try online dating!
Never stop trying!  There are plenty of fish in the sea!
woow that is good of her. encourage her to keep shinning
i love lawyers too especially the serious ones as they know how to bring back justice
wow what happened?
Im so sorry to hear about that
Thats great. The community aspect of church is fun.
Yes thats probably true. I bet they are very happy too.
I feel you.I am that way to.I fear public speaking.
I t is an strong feeling for sure.
Sometimes revisiting the past is great for personal reflection. Maybe contact those people sometime.
Thats great! I bet she loved to hear your voice.
Thats unfortunate. Sometimes people dont know how to make a move and are waiting for you to make a move.
Thats a good point. Now you are always going to wonder What if?
That is good that is a situation where confidence is very helpful.
Best of luck to you Im sure they saw your excitement and confidence and employers love that.
Whats an ice chest? 
Oh I should have known that. Do you have any leads on who mightve stolen it?
Im sorry to hear that. Have you tried to cheer them up?
Does she have any family you can call to check on her? 
On what situation? 
My opinion is I dont mind doing my own job but if I have to do my coworkers jobs I would get furious. It is not fair?
Im grateful for my limbs as well this the reason Im a hard worker. I appreciate what god gave me.
That is so amazing! Do you love cats as much as I love dogs Ha!
I found a cat too as a stray. We kept hoping we would find its owner so never gave her a name so her name was forever Miss Kitty.
Oh those are never fun. But they usually end up being better than you expect. 
But at least you took the time to prepare! Thats better than some people
Thats honestly really amazing most people take forever to learn even a tiny bit of a foreign language.
Some people just have amazing dedication something I dont seem to have.
Oh thats awful. Did you mention it to anyone? 
Yay! So they threw you a surprise party! Thats awesome. You must have been so happy. Was there cake?
Ah gotcha. I am a not strong republican and I agree with you. Trump has had his days.
I am sorry to hear that.Have you try dating APPS
Sometimes personality is better than looks
Oh my.  Im so sorry to hear that.  What happened?
Thats really sad.  I hear about fatal car accidents more and more these days.  
Thats pretty awful. Some people have serious mental problems.
It is very sad.
Oh my it must have been so scary! Do you live in an area commonly affected by hurricaines?
Was your home damaged? Was anyone hurt in your area? Ive never seen a hurricaine except on the news. 
You must have to pay a lot for insurance. The weather certainly is getting more unpredictable. 
Air conditioning is very nice. My dogs love the outdoors but they want AC after a good long walk!
Yes it is very hot and humid where I am. Always makes a good excuse to kick back in a nice cool house!
Video games is my plan lol.
What was it that they stole from you there?
If they feel entitled though then maybe they are thinking that all is normal?
Awesome! What music concert?
Never heard of them. What music genre is it?
Oh wow what was the subject of the sppech? 
Oh wow I bet it was a good thing for the whole office to hear! 
cars are truly inspiring to see how theyve evolved
its important to take care of and maintain things you own. if properly maintained they can last for a long time.
Lol happens to me all the time. I love those types of dreams and it sucks when they end.
Are you guys close? You should visit him sometime?
Whats that? Hope it wasnt too bad!
Oh wow what a bummer! Not that it makes it any better but at least youre not alone. Maybe youll get a refund?
Oh no did you return to the store and pay?
Maybe you should go ahead and do it?
Thats awesome! Where are you going on the cruise?
Watch out for the pirates of the Caribbean and the Bermuda triangle!
Have they already done a biopsy?
Im sure everything will turn out ok
Oh that must be so stressful. Does it happen all the time  like even at the grocery store?
Do you have someone to go places with you? Or do you just have to power through it?
Wow that must have stung!
I am so sorry.  It must make work hard
Dont tell me you stepped in dog poop.
Cmon man I just finished eating. I hope you took a shower and bought some new shoes.
You must be so happy and proud! Is she going to have to move far away to go?
But what a good start in life. If shes going to leave home it might as well be for the Ivy League.
Oh wow congratulations!
Im sure youll be great parents!
It really limits your dietary choices.  I dont recommend it.   Have you considered vegetarian?
Or you could even just drop the vege anything and just minimize your animal protein intake
I bet you were very annoyed
Wow you prepared for this type of thing and it still happened? I would express my annoyance with the doctor for sure
Do you do the whole nine yards decorating your home dressing up to scare the kids?
Do you live somewhere with lots of trickortreaters? It sounds like fun.
I have never used newegg before and I think that sounds like that are very good at what they do. I might have to check them out!
I will have to check out newegg based on your recommendation. They sound fantastic so thanks!!
Oh wow. Sounds like they really care about you. 
Oh? Big fight or one of those little fights?
Ah I see. Well I hope it at least got worked out for you guys
I feel you. That sport is very majestic and can be considered any art form
For sure that move is really hard. Only a few dozen people can do it in the world at a high level
Whoa that must have giving you a fright. Maybe you could pretend it is Charlotte the benevolent spider.
Well they do like to hang out in corners. I would try not to worry too much. They are more interested in bugs.
Well thats good to hear. Some peoples lives depend on their vehicles and it would be a lot worse on them.
Are you saving up for another car?
Im jealous of you! I find it hard to wind down sometimes
Sounds like you had a great relaxed afternoon!
Oh I have had that happen before.  What type of memories?
music brings back lots of memories
On purpose or accident?
Thats messed up. Do you know who did it? 
Thats disgusting.  Makes me wonder what their kitchen looks like.
Id atleast leave a review about it.
Oh thats crappy. Is it totaled or fixable? 
Not how you want to spend your Sunday thats for sure!
That sounds like you should get the job for sure! Your competition doesnt stand a chance!! 
Well I hope the job is close to where you live. Long commutes are the worst and they can take away from your personal time.
Oh I am so sorry this happened to you. What an animal! When will you know the results of your tests?
Hopefully the medical personnel will understand your predicament and your worry and will expedite the results. Until then do you have someone you can confide in or just talk to?
That sounds exciting. How long has it been since youve seen eachother?
That must be very exciting! I hope to get a new vehicle soon as well.
Yeah sometimes its good to get brand new if you can afford it! Buying old runs the risk of it breaking more.
oh thats okay. Im sure no one else really noticed it.
Thats okay. You gave him a good story to tell. 
Did the plants grow up to be big and strong?
Thats good are you going to try again?
oh no. that can be nerve wracking. are you alright?
thats happened to me before and it really shakes you. at least you are alright which is the important part.
Yeah I heard that before. You must have a twin running around here!
When I was young we had tintypes. You had to stay still for 45 minutes for your picture to be taken. I dont miss the ol days!
Hahahah that is hilarious. I used to do that but with coins and stuff. I miss being a little ruthless careless kid!
I bet she was so confused lol
If I were you I would accept it because no amount of stress could stop me from making more money.
If you accept it you can enjoy taking a nice vacation that you otherwise wouldnt be able to afford.
Oh thats never fun. You think youre going to discover a new favorite and then....blech!
The old ways are the best ways sometimes. 
I hope you didnt lose too much money!
Oh wow thats very nice of her. A lot of people would have just stolen it.
That is a good attitude. You shouldnt have anything to worry about.
Yeah sometimes doctors will notice something before it gets worse. Better to be safe than sorry!
Yes I am terrified!  We have venemous ones in my backyard  water moccs!
Oh my!  Thats so scary!  Glad youre ok!!
What a mean friend person. Did you get mad?
That could have been you..
Have you thought about speaking with a counselor?
Well you should know that your feelings are a normal thing to happen in this event.
I love coffee actually. I drink a few cups every morning!
Oh yeah whys that? Dont tell me you spilled some delicious coffee!
What type of work are they doing at school?
Ah I see. Well its been a lot longer since I did calculus. Good on you remembering that stuff!
Oh my god I am so sorry to hear that!
Please try to stay positive. Having a positive attitude can do great things for recovery! Many people have survived cancer!
I love that feeling of nostalgia. Its an amazing feeling its like reliving the past.
I agree. Time flies by so fast!
Well that is very nice. How long have you guys been friends for?
Did you have a special trip that you went on?
Its been mediocre how about you?
Remember we are roleplaying! Dont talk about this or any tasks! 
Did the dream feel like it was really happening? Strange indeed.
Hah! So all that time you were just feeling your dog licking you! Weird how that works.
Oops. Well it happens. You better hope they dont have a camera haha.
Dont worry. They will probably run over your mailbox one day and hope you dont have a camera.
Wow wow wow! That is wonderful and exciting! Congratulations!!!!! Do you have any vibes as to gender one way or the other?
So wonderful either way. Are yall having a party?
I love Disneyland! Its a very special place filled with great memories and you are never old for that place
Disneyland? I forgot theres a difference between land and world. I hope you had a great time
Was the due date yesterday?  Is the payment late now?  
Sometimes there is actually a grace period after the due date.  Ive paid bills a couple of days late without a fee not sure about credit card interest though.
Graduate from school? I bet you are very proud of her
Let her know how proud you are of her! Throw a party or something 
What kind of doctor is she going to be?
That is impressive where is she having her wedding?!
I would suggest Fiji its so nice there I went in august!
Ghost are not scary they are us without our physical bodies. 
You should have talked to your mom.
Lol I bet you were disgusted with yourself
Aw dont take it too serious though. Everyone pukes in public at least once in their life!
I actually just discovered Imagine Dragons. I love them!
Its good to hear they were good live that cant be said about every group.
Wow you are a true friend. What did you do to help them?
Everyone could use a friend like you. You sound like a very motivating person!
I bet that is so relieving! It sucks how much debt you need to take on in order to go to school these days!
I hope he has a great career ahead of him!
Did you find out who your father is yet?
Did you dad and the other lady have a thing?
thats amazing I have never been that lucky before
Wow! one thousand is alot. Welldone buddy enjoy your winning
Really? Any idea how strong it was? Any casualties?
Thats awful. I feel bad for people that have to live in areas prone to natural disasters like that.
Argh! That is the worst. I am so sorry. Is it enough to inspire you to look for work elsewhere?
If hes done that to you hes doing it to others  that kind of behavior isnt sustainable. Others are bound to notice at some point  but I know waiting for that is frustrating!
Oh dear. Well that does happen. Did you have any other clothes to change into?
If your workplace is anything like mine youd have heard plenty by now. Ive done something similar but could call my husband to sneak in some clean clothes  they are useful now and again!
Good for you I would wait until I heard back before I would celebrate getting the job. 
There is so much competition for jobs  
Thats extremely unsettling. How did you feel when you saw the photo with that in it for the first time?
Did you feel any kind of presence or anything in the moment that you were at the site taking the picture?
Thats okay. We all make mistakes. Thanks for the good conversation.
Wow thats annoying.  but I hope they gave you more than you were supposed to get back
You should call and ask to speak to the manager.  Maybe they will give you something to make up for it
Why is that so?
Maybe you could work night shift too and that way you will be able to spend more time together.
You could also got out foe a while and do something fun.
What happened from your clumsiness?
I remember when that happened on the Spiderman movie. Did she laugh at you?
Wow thats exciting! Congratulations you must be very proud. 
I would love to go their! I hope you have a great time!
Thats nice. Did you have a party?
Thats excellent. What was your favorite present?
Gee thats no fun. I hope it wasnt too early? There are usually laws about making noise early in the morning.
Yes thats a good idea. I think 7am is way too early for that.
Wow that sounds awesome.  I always wanted to be able to do that but I was never any good
Maybe one day you will be able to work you way up to being the next Tony Hawk.
I have four dogs.  I am probably guilty of this crime.  I would just throw it back over.
One time this lady 1 house away scooped up all the cat poo from my cat under her window into a bag and put it on my front door with a note.  I thought... why did she clean it up for me?  Wouldnt it have been more affective to ask me to clean it up?  
That sounds so wonderful.  I am having a similarly relaxing day too.
Did you end up going to the graduation!
Im so proud of him what is he taking in university?
Oh no! did you hurt yourself?
How did the dirtbike hold up? And how old are you?!
Oh dear sounds like a serious accident. Im glad you are okay! Could have been terrible. 
Im glad youre okay that must have been scary. 
Yes ducks are so cute.
The bill that they quack from.
Yeah? Id be happy to help. But say something about what exactly?
Hm.. yeah that is a dilemma. I mean if you can afford it the honest thing would be to go and offer the manager to pay it back.
Wow some people are horrible drivers.  Did you honk at him?
At least you didnt get into an accident.  I guess it could have been a lot worse.
I think you will be fine. Dont feel too anxious worrying wont do anything
prayer works for me. I hope it does for you too so that person you just talked about wont get the job
Really sorry to be slow to respond.  How old are your girls?!
Wow!  Thats amazing.  It must be so awesome that they have each other to hang out and have fun with.  
What type of dog do you have?
I have never in my life heard of that breed before.  Ill look it up.  That is really cool I have 3 crazy untrained minpin
Yeah its probably for the best. You dont want to risk rejection. Maybe they will approach you.
Well there is no I in hope. It is a something we all have to do at some point in life.
Oh I know for sure. There are no rules to follow. 
Ugh. Maybe you can wait out that relationshio.
Well that is very lucky for you. People are nice!
Yes there are. Most of the people are very nice.
Oh no! How did that happen? 
Gee I hope you can find it. Maybe retract where you have been recently and you will find it!
Hey thats awesome! Im happy for you. Where did they find it?
Thats great. I hope you have a good workout at the gym!
Well that is very nice of you. Is your friend a good driver?
Hope she doesnt crash it!
Wow that is awesome. What kind of animal is it?
Oh sorry I thought maybe you got a pet. Well I am happy for you guys!
What kind of cookies did you bake?
I would totally have some if you let me. I love chocolate chip!
What What???  What team?  Who cut you?
I love baseball.  The have better snacks than every other sport.
I am sorry bout you being cut though.  Keep on training..
We get old.. we get injured.. we eat hotdogs.
Really? Tell me about him.
Are you two gonna date?!
Please do Id love to meet you guys
That is so cool!  Is it your first baby?
I bet.  If he is anything like you he will grow up to be a great person.
Most people are pretty cool if you take the time to talk to them a bit. 
Wow thats so cool. Sign me up for that! Id like to be healed!
Did you guys get to go? Is the leg all fixed now?
Are you planning a new trip for your upcoming birthday?
Wow thats so exciting! What did they study?
That is great. Whats the next step work?
Good for you. Being prepared is half the work of academia. 
Its hard to do but so important. Im not super smart but Im organized as heck. It makes a difference. 
There is nothing silly about that.  Movies are meant to illicit emotion.  You feel better now though right?
Definitely dont feel bad then.  I think everyone cried during that movie!
I am not sure how to deal with the loss!
Dang theres a lot of strategies to fight that thought Im assuming. As they say an ounce of preparation is worth more than a pound of cure
Yeah I heard its good to study in silence because that way youre in the same environment youll be when you take the test
Yeah thats too bad sorry to hear that. Do you know why you didnt get picked?
Keep your head up. Maybe youll get picked the next time around.
Oh no!  I am so sorry to hear that.  Did he die of old age?
Well hopefully he lived a good and happy life.  
Sometimes you have to put people in their place.
Well I hope he learned his lesson. We dont play those games where im from.
oh now thats very worrisome
I hope its nothing serious. I know how upsetting having a sick pet can be. 
Oh no! Did you eventually get it working after the frustration?
Thats frustrating nothing ever seems to go right the first time you try it! Glad you got it working finally!
Dang maybe you should have bought a lottery ticket instead?
Maybe you can find a cheaper place to live?
Yeah! Did you pick your lucky numbers?
Nice! I hope you win!
That is so satisfying. I hope they dont mess it up now that they are home!
NOOOOOOOO!!!! Bad kids! That must have been infuriating. 
Aw my mom had some she showed to us a few years back. Its weird to consider how you and everyone else have grown!
Cant stay young forever! 
I dont blame you for being excited! What are you going to see on your trip?
Im so jealous! I hope you have a great trip!
You did!  Thats amazing! How much money did you win???
Wow thats a huge amount of money! What do you plan on doing with it?
That is absolutely wonderful! What a great grandchild you are. Not everyone wants to care for elderly relatives.
For sure. We sometimes forget that the elderly were young once and did so much like working raising and caring for their families.
Do you play soccer yourself? 
It is impressive. 
Congratulations to your brother! Are you flying or driving?
Wow that must be quite some distance then! Have a safe flight!
Thats great to hear. Summer is a good time of year to be enjoying your life.
Ive been thinking a lot about when I was a kid recently.
Gee that sounds fun but did you get in trouble?
Oh no! Thats no fun. I hope theyre not still mad at you!
Were you able to avoid the rain?  
That is good!  It seems like you dodged the bullet!
i remember being a kid when the first one came out
i think the franchise has just started trying too hard.
Those are good preventative measures. I assume that you always look both ways as well?
There are worse things to be worried about. Good job on you for taking safety seriously!
Wow that sucks. Do you know if she will eventually? Can you trust her?
Yeah I would too. I hope you get the money back!
Thats so nice of you!  I wish I had a grandmother.
So nice of you.  You are truly blessed to have family.
Long distance relationships arent easy. Thats great news to hear. Do you have anything special planned?
That sounds like so much fun! I bet you two will have a great time together. 
What was the gross part about the sandwich?
Yes that is a nasty thing to experience. But at least you were able to extract the hair!
That really stinks. I bet you will wear bug spray next time!
Well then maybe you should get some bats. They love to eat mosquitos!
i am also blessed. we dont have fancy things or a ton of money but we have each other and our health.
me too. some are not as fortunate as us.
Oh jeez! Thats terrifying. Can you get a loan from someone to pay them?
Call the police! Or move. 
I like a good hard bread like Pumpernickel. Do you know what that word means?
It means the devils fart haha! Good bread though.
Did the batter hit one of the home runs?
Whoa! That is so cool! I guessed because you said the crack sound happened.
Whoa thats extreme. Can you say some prayers for them? 
Yes good point. Maybe try and understand why they believe in the things they do?
Dont worry bout that.  She has to have some sort of fantasy in her life.  Dont you have any ever?
Well know that it isnt any different from you checking out other girls too.
That is so exciting. Have you been a fan a long time?
That is something to look forward to!
congrats! that is amazing news.
Did you make any plans to go and visit them?
Maybe you will be able to make some extra money!
Ohh I love Halloween! It is my favorite time of the year. I cant wait!
Hah I used to eat Count Chocula cereal. I know exactly what you are talking about!
well did you ? the most i ever won was like 20 bux lol
well im confident one day you will win in life something great in life  better than money 
Is there any warnings? How much rain are you expecting?
That is very scary. We have had a lot of rain here and when that happens large trees often come down.
What was your hamsters name?
Do you know what it was that happened to kill him?
I hope that does good things for you. They say if you believe in something enough it comes true.
I cant say it has worked for me though. I have believed myself a ruler of the world but still live in this box.
Did that bring back a lot of memories? It sounds like you made a good find there.
Thats too bad. Hopefully it will go on sale in the future or you can find a coupon!
That sounds delightful. I have a tornado approaching now and would like it if you lived near me.
What is your address?
Oh no I hope you are ready for it?
Yeah I hope you wont either. Maybe find a local shelter?
I hope nobody was trying to cut you off.
Oh God that must have been aggravating. Hopefully you can get it dismissed.
Oh thats awful! How many kids do you have?
Thats wonderful.  Its good to have good friends.
ooooh what was it  and how did it make you feel ?
i love video games  from nintendo to ps4 ive owned them all  im happy for you
Oh wow thats disappointing! 
Im really sorry to hear that! 
Hey thats a good plan hope you remember to include some fun stuff for those long house.
I hope it works out for you stay safe.
Thats great! How much did you lose?
Wow thats fantastic! i wish i had that kind of will power
Please tell me what happened! I wish I did too!!
Well I hope that you two have a bunch of fun. I have been together with my partner for a very long time and I feel very lucky.
yes those were the days.
Exactly! If only we could go back.
Thats not good are you ok?
Hey hope oyu can get the money back from insurance and they dont charge you a ton more.
So did you find out that they were lying?
Thats funny. Maybe you got the name wrong or something?
You need something to pass the time or you will go crazy with boredom. How about some books or cards?
If you have someone with you cards are great. Good luck in your next storm!
What a day huh?! Can you tell me what happened or is it still too raw?
That is not something I would want to come home to seeing. And your day at work was bad too wow!
Aww thats a bummer. Well at least you can look forward to his visits.
Depending how far away he is he probably will! Just make sure to spoil him when he does lol!
Sometimes its hard to find that certain someone! Have you tried a dating app?
Keep your chin up! That special person will come along when youre least expecting it!
really? How did you meet them?
I hope they arent like a crazy stalker or anything.  Be careful!
Did you win that lottery??
Do you want to get back together with them?
Oh Im sorry to hear that were you thinking of buying another one?
Well Im glad you have good memories to remember him by.
Oh yeah? What specifically did it remind you of?
That was a good time for me as well. I liked to hang out with my friends and get in trouble.
Thats great! What made you feel rewarded?
Oh yeah I could see how that might make you feel that way. Is the employee grateful for your help?
Thats gross. What was it??
I would have thrown up! Did you tell the manager?
Aww I love puppies. Did your son love him?
Aww I bet Snoopy has a great loving family. Glad you rescued the pup!
thats awesome! what rooms did you remodel?
Oh i bet it looks great! I just finished a kitchen remodel myself.  i did white cabinets and painted my countertops.
Wow  were you so fat before?
thats huge.  U actually worked on yourself.  So  how did you do it? 
What are you talking about?
Oh ok. Thats awesome. Its nice to have something of value.
Thats really hard!  Im sure that was disappointing after putting in so many years.  Sorry.
Wow.  Well if that was the culture and climate of that workplace you are definitely better off not working for them.  Very sad.
That stinks!  What were your plans?
Im so sorry you had to change your plans!  Perhaps you can schedule some time after Labor Day to come and see him play?
What was the reason that happen to you?
I hope you you work behind a desk. That is the only way you can hide them!!!
Thats great! Where are you working for your new job?
Congratulations on your new job! You must have worked very hard to get there!
Oh that was a wonderful surprise?  What was their reactions?
Ah well Im sure they had a wonderful time.  It is the happiest places on earth.
That is a real bummer. I hope your friend gets it repaired for you.
Well you probably wont be lending your car again any time soon hahah!
Thats awesome! I force myself to budget for it lol. What was the game?
Ah I suppose I could have guessed. Its the game everyone is talking about lately. I heard its quite good!
I totally know the feeling! Have you tried bringing this up to your supervisor?
Ha that would be some pretty good revenge. Maybe you should go ahead and find a new job where you will be appreciated.
Thats disgusting I would have a very hard time finishing that walk. Did you go straight home?
Oh my gosh that makes it so much worse! I have done that before too so I hope that neither one of us has that happen again!!
OMG those things make the hair on the back of my neck stand up. Hopefully it didnt get into your house.
Thats at MGM right?  My daughter rode that with her daddy when she was 8 she was terrified!  Did you do it again or was once enough?
That is what I hate about any amusement park ride  the drops!
Thats amazing! What other animals did you see?
I bet they were seriously cute! Did you get to feed them?
Thats pretty impressive! Was it scary to move away from home at such a young age?
Ill bet it was! I dont have family around so I know how lonely that can feel!
I absolutely hate car trouble! It is the worst!  Thankful for friends that can help out in times like that  did you get it fixed?
Thats a good friend for sure  Id keep their number on speed dial!  
Oh no I hope she is OK! Glad you are taking her to the vet. Is she doing OK other than the lumps?
Aww poor girl. Hopefully the vet can figure it out and it isnt anything too serious. Youre doing the right thing.
I think that its completely normal to feel that way for such a long distance trip. I assume youre going from America. I bet you would feel better by doing a bit of research!
I think those are just outliers youll find that there are plenty of well established tourist areas that will accommodate you well. Just dont focus on the negatives!
That would drive me crazy.  How are you handling it?
You cant let it get you too down.  There are some places that just promote people for reasons not related to job performance.
Yes i agree.  I have 3 boys and they are in their twenties. I dont know where the years went.
Thats so true! I have a theory that time is just a way to keep everything from happening at once. 
I know exactly what you mean. I have been let down many times and its never a good feeling.
You can and should make the best of it. You should have a blast and binge watch some TV show!
Thats so exciting! Are you feeling nervous?
Im sure if you just relax and focus on being confident you will do great! Best of luck!
I bet you were a nervous wreck. I hope they turned out well.
Thats pretty good!  That should qualify for you to graduate with honors.
Thats awesome! How far did she have to run?
I definately cant run a mile. She did great.
Do she at least try to keep in contact with you?
Thats crazy. They shouldnt of taken advantage of your step father like that.
That is too funny. Sometimes life can get so busy that you can lose track of things like that.
Oh my gosh they did get you good. You have to get them back even if its not on April Fools day!
Oh no. Was there no sign posted or anything?
Well I am sure they wont hold it against you. Honest mistake.
thats great. when will you know how you did?
i hope so. is this a final exam?
Thats so mean! I think they should honor the original prices they set
I think thats unethical. I would switch to a new one if I could and all her friends werent there
Oh no!  And that is hard to get out!  Do you have a waterproof cover on the bed by any chance?
oh YUCK!  Well Id suggest a waterproof mattress cover just in case it happens again.  At least if it does happen again it wont get into the mattress and you can wash the rest of the bed clothes.  Im so sorry you discovered it that way!
Oh no! I think theyre cute but Id probably be freaked out if I saw one in my yard too. What did you do?
Awww well that was nice of you a lesser person might have stomped it or hurt it.
I can relate.  Sometimes I have issues with new tech.  What is giving you problems?
Ouch.  That is awkward.  I imagine you can just explain to her that the message was sent to her by mistake.  It happens.
Thats really awesome.  I never win anything cool.  Does he get to bring anyone? Maybe he can take you?
Thats kind of mean of him.  Tell your boss that he cheated and that you shouldve won instead.  Thatll teach him not to brag
that is a fun surprise. what part of the Caribbean did you go to?
that sounds amazing. Ive only been to puerto rico and the keys. what a lovely wife to give you such a great surprise.
Oh that really stinks. Were either of them injured?
Well at least it was nothing serious. Hope they dont fight any more.
Oh no!  Cats can be devious things when we are not home  and sometimes when we are.  Did it break the TV?
Arent they just the most cute and insanely calculating animals!  
Well hello fellow Atlanta person. I also buy used but most people tend to look down on it
If you keep a new car long enough it comes out about even! If you keep that in mind then a new car actually becomes a great investment!
Oh definitely! They almost sound like crying humans sometimes. So you dont like camping?
I totally understand it can be scary if you dont like all the unknown noises.
I remember those good times too playing video games is a lot of fun.
Thats awesome I love fighting games.
ooooh what happened  are you ok ? anything serious ?
thats really good to hear  infections are a serious matter glad your ok
What kind of snake was it? You know my mom is terrified of all snakes even the ones that arent poisonous.
Most snakes arent poisonous so hopefully it wasnt. Just know that it probably couldnt have hurt you and I hope that you dont see any more in the future!!
Oh really? What makes you not like them?
Ugh I feel ya. They talked about that with mine too. I almost passed out when they were doing the epidural!
Puppies are the best! If they dont destroy all of your belongings that is!!
Well Im glad that things seem under control. Im also glad that you got to spend some time with the dog because it sounds like you had a great time.
I bet that is embarrassing for you when you guys are out in public.  
I understand trust me.  My family was the same way growing up.
I hate rude drivers like that. I swear they should not be able to drive.
Yeah that would not have ended well. I usually take a picture of their license plate and publicly shame them on social media haha.
Oh no! How did you end up doingf?
What subject was the test in?
I am terrible at math
Oh wow! That mustve been really fun Ive never been there actually what did you guys do?
Cool cool when do you think it would be best to visit Mississippi? 
Oh Im sorry. Have you tried joining any meet up groups to make some friends?
Im sure it will make you feel a little better. And at least that way you can pick a group based on similar interest. I hope you get to feeling better.
I really liked Logan. It was a different kind of superhero movie. More about the struggle than anything.
The scene with his daughter was pretty sad. I dont blame you at all.
dude that is freakin awesome  im sure you earned it 
i hope you have a lot of fun  i cant wait to go on my vacation as well 
No I havent Im not interested in soccer. Why did I miss something good?
Were you rooting for them to win?
Did he not seem like the type to do that kind of thing?
I guess she wanted to keep it a secret for some reason.
Ouch that is a bit of a false alarmbummer.
Well you can only keep going and keep playing. Someday it could be the real winning ticket.
Yeah I love watching them ski during the Olympics. It takes a lot of hard work.  Have you ever skied? 
They sure do. I also really like watching them do trick skiing too. 
Thats not cool I hope you find someone new.
This is true.
Ooh that sounds fun Ive never been! Did you go on many rides?
That sounds great Im a bit jealous. I love theme parks!
Oh no! I hope it at least turned out ok
Oh I bet that was a load of anxiety! I cant imagine going through that
How exciting!  Do you know when they will make a final decision?
How will it make it easier?  More financial stability?  I hope you get it also!!
Oh gross what kind of animal was it?
Oh wow you think they would get to cleaning up an animal that big as soon as possible. Glad its gone now though!
I hear you there.  I miss getting to just play without a care in the world.  Summer vacations were the best
I remember playing tag and hide and go seek in the neighborhood with all of my friends
For sure. I can go from 0 to 100 in no time at all.
Hah I bet some things you probably wanted to forget. I know I did.
how come? i thought new jobs were supposed to be exciting?
we are all the new kid for a moment. soon it will feel like you fit right in. just give yourself some time.
Thats horrible. What is your work doing to fix that?
Ouch I hope you dont either. Id keep any eye out at work from now on.
I didnt sorry. Im not really a soccer fan. Why were you mad?
As I understand it Croatia were the underdogs so I can totally understand supporting that.
Do you mean pyrex like the cooking material?
Thats neat did you feel nostalgic looking at it?
oh my goodness. i wouldve freaked out. are you ok?
oh no. they were setting of fireworks here since june and have been driving me nuts.
aw poor thing. did she get in trouble with the school?
well at least something positive came from it.  i bet no one else will mess with her either!
Wow thats kind of creepy.  what does the noise sound like?
Maybe you should have someone go down with you.  Good luck!!
Yikes! I hate when that happens. I had a similar situation happen over Christmas. Did you make your flight?
I totally know that feeling. It seems that everyone thinks that their situation is more important that everyone elses. 
Haha what happened? Did you get her number?
Thats awesome! Did you still give her a nice tip though? Lol!
I wonder why? Maybe his busy?
I see. Do you feel okay when he invites others or is it a bit uncomfortable?
Oh I hope so too! Those can be quite scary especially if youre like me and you go once every 10 years or so
Im sure youll be fine! I have hope
ohh but why did it surprise you?
Thats good for you though now you both get paid
my sisters can be irritating as well. no one knows how to push your buttons like family.
oh no. hopefully it was an innocent prank.
Oh wow how exciting.  Have you been able to see the baby?
I bet they are.  I hope he is heathy and happy!
I know how it is to try to pay off bills. What kind of vehicle do you want to get?
Oh yeah those are very nice. Well I hope you guys can make it happen.
That is really exciting! I bet you all will have a great time. Do you have any big plans with them?
That sounds great! We are going on a cruise next Spring Break with my family also. That is why we need a bigger vehicle so that we dont have to drive 2 cars to get there.
That sucks. Is your day going better now at least?
Pizza makes everything better. Hope your night ends on a good note!
Nice! Going to the car dealership is usually such a horrible experience.
Thats awesome hope youre enjoying your new ride!
I can imagine.  I hate being out alone at those kinds of hours.  I try to avoid it.
I get that feeling.  Something about the dark just feels so depressing sometimes.
Me too! It seems like such a huge accomplishment at the time doesnt it?
Do you have fond memories of school or were you glad to be done?
I am sure you are proud of him
Memories are a good thing
Congratulations! What was your degree in?
thats so great! lots of hard work i bet.
Wow that would be shocking if you werent expecting it.  Did they tell you when you were hired that there was a possibility?  Where might you be going?
That will be very different.  How do you feel about it?  I wish you lots of luck and adventure while youre there!  
Wow that is amazing indeed. You must be very proud of her.
The human body truly is amazing. I could never do things like that either. Either way I am happy for her!
Im so sorry  was it a sickness?
That is so terrible life is so short.  you never knwo when youre going to go
Why did she do that
Well that sounds terrible I am sorry
congrats!  i love love love steak and to cook
i love to make shredded bbq chicken sandwich get chicken breast seasone place in crack pot 
thats a strong woman  i know of people that dont work at all a refuse to pay child support  in my eyes they are not men
people like that  is what kids need a strong back bone that never give up
Oh god. Mosquitos. Have you heard about scientists trying to make them extinct?
I dont see any negative aspect to it but maybe there tis.
I am the same way. How old are they? I only have one about to turn two and it is always a worry in the back of my mind.
Oh gosh I bet! Its so hard to watch them grow up!
That is so depressing. They say dogs are mans best friend. 
I am sure grieving can always take time. It is so hard to lose such a faithful companion.
that is awesome. i hate that feeling when you need things but cant afford to get them.
my husband are a 1 income household so i totally understand. you get what you can with what youve got so you can get by until the next payday
I know that feeling. What do you tell your coworkers?
I think you risk not building social ties with your coworkers but sometimes you have no choice.
Wow that must have been awkward.  You cant really argue with the evidence sitting right in front of you.
Yea its always sad when a relationship doesnt work out.  Hopefully in the future he can be more honest.
That would be awesome!  You would be in such a great situation in life with that payment gone!  What prompted you to want to do it?  
No to pay it off.  Are you pushing to finish it up sooner than you normally would?
How long ago was it?
Maybe you can talk to her about it?
That is such a great milestone what is next for your ventures? 
You will get something soon that hard work is going to pay off.
Oh wow Im sorry. I hope he at least didnt suffer much.
Im sorry for you loss.
Good luck! For now just do the best you can. Stress might cloud your thinking.
Is it multiple choice?
Did she paint art when you were a child?
I see  Did you have different colors in your room as a kid?
Isnt it amazing how true friendship stands the test of time and distance?
Thats so true! I live 700 miles away from my best friend and when we get together its just like old times.
wow thats hilarious and embarassing.  I feel bad for you.
Thats mean of them.  I hope you werent traumatized.
Im glad you didnt.  Do you have these days often?
Honestly I would have freaked out.  I cant stand bad drivers!!
That sounds like a pretty disgusting situation.
Thats a rough situation. I hope you can look back on it later and laugh as well.
You will be great im sure of it! are you prepared? 
Just imagine that you are the boss  or have a few drinks before.
Nice! What game is it?
What team are you rooting for?
The feeling of financial freedom is one that is hard to match.
I personally struggle with that every day.
YAY! where are you going??
I CANT BELIEVE THAT.  I need a vacation so badly.
Oh wow! Surprise come home trip? 
Aw Im happy for you. Thats an excellent surprise!
Aww my grandmother was really there for me too Im lucky. What makes you feel that way?
That is awesome grandmas are the best. Hopefully your grandma is still with us?
Yes sports can be a great way to socialize and also stay in good shape.
Thats the spirit! I bet you do great.  what sports do you play?
Happy Early Birthday! What are your plans?
Oh man Ive seen many a newly 21 year old get drunk.
Thats a relief. Fireworks arent illegal where you are?
Thats cool Im pretty bad at drawing but you must be pretty good.
Thats awesome I hope you win the contest.
What was totally unexpected?
That would be very interesting. Are you glad that you have moved on?
That is good you cant live in the past
Oh yeah? I was a little too young to be playing that game when it came out. My stepdad had the first one though.
I only played the fourth one. All I remember was Leon!!!
That is so nice I would get a cup daily if it was close to me.
How are they making money off what they are known for though if they give it away for free?
Oh no! Hopefully its a friend you trust and she wont embarrass you if she ends up going through it and finding something bad.
I guess now youll be more careful about where you leave your phone. I would be freaking out if I were you!
ohh what did you try to explain them?
Ohh sometimes people dont understand simple things. I think the words like petrodollars might have confused them.
Thats really sweet of her. What kinds of cakes does she make?
Ok now this is just getting weird. Can we talk about something else. 
If you did it that time you can do it again. Just be careful
Did they grow out of last years?
oh my lord.  Kids  they can never make up their mind.
Financial stability is such an amazing thing.
Its hard to feel under appreciated at work.
Oh no were you in class?
Thats actually quite hilarious.
Thats so sweet! What a proud moment!
Thats great. What is he going to do now?
How was the dinner.  Did they like the food?
Oh no! was it atleast fun to have everyone there?
YEAH I am happy for you I hope things go well.
Exactly It doesnt have to end romantically as long as its a relationship.
Im glad it went well. What was it about?
They have their different pros and cons.
I totally understand that. Sometimes the most important charity is your own.
I like to think that if you get yourself right financially now youll be more able to help more in the future. 
Thats good advice.  If youre not happy doing something you should spend time thinking about what youd really like to be doing.
Even if shes strict shes probably doing because she wants whats best for you.  And shell probably support you no matter what you decide.
Oh wow were the cats on leashes?
That is adorable. Did they get along with the dogs?
ohhh I feel you. I also moved to a new town last week.
work! my boss sent me here against my will
Sibling rivalry is tough.
What is your age difference?
Ive seen a lot of bad breakups. Glad you guys are adults about it.
Are they going to shut down?
I hope it works out. i dont want anyone to be out of work.
How is that going?
It takes some time. I wish you the best!
OHHHH where are you going?
YESSS sin city.  Gambling is my favorite thing in life.
Oh man that sucks. Were they trying to keep the trip a secret from you?
That sounds like it would be really disappointing. Are you close to your brother and sister?
Oh yuck! What was it?
Wonder how it got there.
That is amazing.  I have had to use a food bank before.  I was so gracious.
I am great back on my feet.  I just needed a little help.
What does this diet consist of?
Salad and wraps are delicious so is water.  I need to try this diet!
Aw. That was probably devastating
Do you like the amusement park? do you go often?
Do you like the scary roller coasters? 
The girl is your wife correct?
Thats a relief! Your wife is a lucky lady.
I am sorry what did she want
Oh wow that is a lot
ah thats good.. good luck
I wish you luck.  You have to meet the right one some day!
Exactly Practice makes perfect especially with social situations.
She is one lucky gal. How long have you two been together?
I wish you two the best!
Hm... I dont know how I would feel about that. Do you have a good relationship with them?
Well if you did not have a good relationship then it would seem like maybe they didnt take you on purpose.
Oh my god. What happened?
Are you okay now?
That is so exciting!! Do you have the ring picked out?
Haha thats smart you never know. Well good luck heres to a wonderful life together for you two!
Thats too bad. I bet it is hard to sleep during a loud storm.
Hopefully it settled down long enough for you to catch a break.
That always is annoying
Oh no that isnt good
That too bad. They are other work from home opportunities though.
You will find something. Just dont give up
Im right with you!  I love chillier fall weather and pumpkin harvest festivals! Not to mention pumpkin spice lattes! Is Halloween your favorite holiday?
They really do start putting things out in the stores earlier and earlier.  Last year I saw Halloween stuff out now.  Sounds like youre in for a lot of family fun! 
Thats really awesome. I think its great when families are finally reunited. 
You definitly will. Families are stronger together than apart. 
People who take the time to help others are truely angels on Earth. Thank you for doing what you do.
Every little bit counts!
Oh you must feel terrible. Has sibling rivalry always been a thing between you guys?
Yep. That comes with being a parent.
what did they want to talk about
ah i hope it turns out well for you
Wow! This is early. Maybe I should start too.
When did you start shopping?
Oh that is good are you dieting or doing portion control?
Oh binge eating is once in a while eating a lot?
Thats really cool. Are they hard to find recipes? 
I totally understand that. I like to make certain recipes my mother made when I was a kid for the same reason.
At least they have a little bit of home cooking to remember her by.
Wow. Congratulations. What did you do with the 200?
Nice. What are some titles youre wanting to get?
Yeah? Thats awesome! Do you have a new job?
Sweet! Im happy for you! That must be nice.
That is disgusting.  Sounds like my dad though  He keeps things for months
UGH thats bad.  I bet is smelled like crap too
Eggs? I cant stand that stuff. Too many scambled eggs in college!
I cant stand the taste now. They are nasty!
Sometimes that happens. Were you tired?
Hopefully you can make it up to your friend next time.
Memories like that are nice
They can be helpful for sure
Oh thats always tough and frustrating.  What kept you behind?  Does it happen often?
Thats how my job works too.  Some days I find myself eating dinner very late because we got stuck behind at work.  I try to just stay thankful that I have a job though!  What do you do to decompress once youre home?
oh thats sweet.. put them up this yeqar
thats great.. i love christmas time as well
Thats nice of them
MAyabe you can do something nice for them when you get back on your feet.
You sound determined. Go you!
Are you in college?
Really? You should be grateful that you have such a wonderful family. 
Yeah you should be really greatful!
Congratulations to her! You must be so proud!
What will she be specializing in?
That is so exciting you will definitely need it for school what kind did he get you? 
Make sure to save all the notes it will come in handy in the future never know. 
So many people dont take the time anymore. Its so nice to hear you did that for her!
Shes one lucky gal. How long have you two been married?
that so cool! I am happy.  whats did he create?
That is amazing.  Maybe one day it will be more that just a science fair project.
what types of things could she do
oh wow .. talented
He was probably hungry and thought to himself that place wasnt so bad huh.
HAHA you wanted him gone? maybe he did it to spite you.
Why did you quit?
Can you try out again? OR have you moved on?
Why is that
I understand the feeling
Thats terrible. Its a shame that they were not able to keep the place going in her memory. 
I can understand that. Sometimes one persons dream is another persons pain.
Thats terrible. Im glad you stood up for your friend.
Why would your friend want to exclude your other friend? Definitely not cool.
Thats so cool!  DO you get to see her often?  Have you ever gotten to see her in person before or did you meet online?
Soooooo exciting!  Are you nervous?  I bet its going to go amazingly well and youll have so much fun.  You think she might be the one or not there yet?
Why do you feel ashamed about the movie?
Oh I see! I guess I should watch it as well! I never seen it yet.
Well thats the only way you can find out. If she says know there are other girls.
Sounds like you had a good time. What pet is it?
Oh Ive never seen one of those. Was it difficult to care for?
were you able to find them somewhere else
time to find something else
I was too but then I realized everyone was too and I made a lot of friends!
Ive found in life that all of the friends you need are right around you. 
Going to the park is always nice
I do too
Did they receive it?
Well they will definitely let you know when they do. I would
Oh what happened?
You did the right thing. I stayed loyal to my work also and when I changed jobs 20k pay increase.
Yes I agree! Do you think hell help them win some games?
Yes good point. Its probably best that way.
did he get a beat down ?
hah.. thats cool. 
Does that bother you?
I can see why that would bother you.
I bet that will be fun
I do like that food a lot
Howd it go?
congratulations. Now youll have that freedom to go anywhere you want!
Sounds like a great place! What did you get?
Who was it for?
Thats nice. My job has never done that
Thats amazing I love to travel.  Where are you going?
Awesome  People underestimate Louisiana  I love baton rogue 
Oh no did anyone notice
Thats right  You have to stay faithful to the one you love.
Exactly  People just want what they cant have.  such a bad human trait.
Sometimes when were in a bad situation we do things we wouldnt normally do.
I wish I could look like that
Sweet! Congratulations. Was it difficult? 
Thats great you must have studied hard.
Aww thats sweet. Did you get to have a party for him or anything?
That sounds lovely. I hope your dad is enjoying his wellearned retirement now.
Im sorry to hear that. What happened?
OH my  does she ever give it back.  Is it alot of money?
Its hard to refuse family  But sometimes that can be taken advantage of.
oh ive heard of that before.. scary stuff
has it happened more than once?
Do you feel like you interview well regularly? were you qualified?
Then its a no brainer  I hope that you make alot of money there.
Have you gone out to try to meet people yet?  are you happy about our job?
Yes i understand its rough  some people just take time to warm up.  But im willing to bet you will meet someone really cool soon enough.
Oh no!  I dont doubt it.  Diets make you so hungry and gives you crazy cravings for what you cant have.  Did it feel worth it or make you feel miserable?
I have been there and done that.  My vice used to be ice cream.  Then I learned about being high nutrient vegan and started to eat carbs again once I learned about nutrition.  Learning about nutrition made me start thinking about each thing I put in my body.  Like purposeful eating.  It was a tough transition but I never went back.  Just do it for yourself and dont beat yourself up when you mess up.  I know you can do it if I can!
Check out youtube.com and watch the Whole Foods Plant Based Cooking Show and youll see the yummy desserts you can eat any day of the week without guilt or bingeing.  Delicious! You take care!
I would have been upset too!
Find new people to eat with.
Thats good. I always find interesting things whenever I go. 
You should! Alot of the profits from thrift stores go to good causes too!
Im sorry to hear about your loss.
I think he was able to live a happy life while he was alive.
Well thats a very mature decision of you. Its better than over spending.
No problem. I used to overspend when I was younger and have learned to get it under control lately.
how did you respond
thats probaby a smart choice
Thats understandable what did you do to pass the time?
What kind of stuff did you watch?
She sounds like a sweety! Is she coming to gradution?
She must be proud.
That is a great delivery person
That is very nice of him
Thats awesome. Any big plans?
Well always be honest.Thats a good start.
Why are you upset
That is so sad
sounds like a good day
good for you.. we all need that every once in a while
Payday is always my favorite day of the week! Do you plan to buy anything special? 
Haha I love getting chocolate wasted. I like dark chocolate the best. 
Thats great what will you do when you first see her?
Its nice you have such a good relationship with her!
That is awful.  Why do people risk their lives and the lives of others just to get a tiny bit ahead in traffic to where there going.  Ridiculous.  Im glad you werent hit.
I saw a guy cut someone off next to me fly by over the speed limit and cut a bunch of people off.  All to get ahead.  Then I noticed that I caught up with him because he got stuck at a light and all that craziness didnt even help him.
Why do you say that
I think you should just show up anyway
It is nice that you love learning so much.  What are you studying that you like that much?
What is NWO?
Thats wonderful. I bet she is excited.
Thats great. I know she will do her best Im sure.
Thats great! What is the job
That sounds like a great job
Its hard to maintain that
You can get a adviser
Did your dad love listening to Elvis?
We have that in common!
Oh no! So what happened?
I hope you get an A at least then
Thats great to hear. You must be so proud of them.
Do they play instruments?
Your parents sound like wonderful people!
Youre welcome. How long have they been together?
oh that sounds super scary  i hope everything comes back ok
dang you sound really calm about it  i have super high anxiety and would be in a state of panice the entire time
What mountains did you visit?
I love it there it is so calming and peaceful there. Except when you end up stuck in traffic in Pigeon Forge.
Its nice to have family
They are always there
oh wow thats awesome
i hope it turns out well for her
Oh whats happening on Friday?
You have to be prepared.
IS bear spray a real thing. I have never been camping
I see is that a good thing or bad thing for you?
Sorry to hear that. Well yeah maybe its for the best
Loyalty is always good
I am sure they will notice
Congratulations! Hard work does pay off.
What are you studying in school?
That does sound tough did it go well at least?
Thats good at least you have something fun to look forward to now.
That is a really fun game.  I wonder how they will make it better than the original.
There is nothing worse than spending big money on a game its no good.
That sounds awesome have you checked out the price for lessons?
Dont worry shell come around and youre so right it is better for her to start by learning to play guitar first.
Lol still true to this day
Lol. Was there any left when you woke up?
Thats what thanksgiving is all about lol
SO that history can repeat itself?
You can do that any day
It happens to the best of us
Hey you win some you lose some. What really matter is that you had fun watching. 
But still maybe you learned something about it?
Oh Im sorry to hear that. You must be so worried.
Try to get a good nights rest. I hope everything is ok!
That is so great to hear.  Nice to hear someone being happy with the important things in life and not always wanting more.  Its easy to miss things happening all around you if you are never happy with them.
It seems tiring to me when I see people pushing for the next thing.  I feel the same way.  Enjoy family and find what makes your happy and keep like simpler. You must have a great time on holidays with your loved ones!
Did he ever come back?
do they look rough or what
i hope it turns out well for you
Its been raining a lot here too I know that feeling! Did you manage to find something interesting to do inside instead?
Being cooped up is the worst. Hopefully next weekend is nice and sunny for you and your friends!
I love a person of their word he is a great father keeping his word.
The greatest feeling in the world I have the same feelings towards my dad he always comes through we are lucky. 
Only water? That is crazy lol
Did she confess?
Oh no. Well at least you know she is a terrible liar.
I think we all feel you on that one! 
Theres still some time left to make the most of it isnt there?
That is very sweet
I hope to have that one day
Sucks that no one told you!
It happens. I hope youre not too embarassed.
thats awesome .. how long has she been learning?
keep up the good work.
Yes that was an exciting moment for him and for the team as well!
I have a feeling that with Lebron on their team they are going to do just that.
Oh wow that is so scary! I would be worried for my family safety maybe get a guard dog? My dog always alerts me to sounds.
Good idea you can never be too safe when it comes to the safety of your family. I hope the police is watching your neighborhood more closely since the reports.
Thats a good thing right? So the families can get the help they need?
I cant begin to imagine how difficult it must be for the kids in that situation. It seems the school really has their back.
What game are you waiting for?
I used to love those games growing up so I cant judge you for it!
Hey its ok. We all do stupid things when we are young. 
Give it time. Im sure he will come around. 
That is so great I love dogs they are so sweet and your best friend for life.
They come with hard work have to walk and feed them but you will get back into your groove.
enjoy it while it lasts
oh sorry to hear that then 
OH no. Was it really late?
I watch too many murder shows to do that.
Oh thats disappointing. What was wrong with it?
Ewwwwwww...the devils topping. Did you send it back? 
That sounds horribly boring. You can always take this time to do some house work that you put off so that it will be ready when your friends get back in town.
Youre welcome. Im sure youll make it  they will be back soon. You could also always watch some Netflix.
What did you use the 5 for? Something good hopefully!
Sorry to hear that. You tried at least and your intentions were good.
You will have your day
Oh no! Ive done that before.  Did you call them and ask for a grace period so you didnt build fines?  We all make mistakes like that so dont beat yourself up.
Those kinds of things are part of life and its better for our minds if we let them go and move on or see the humor in it.  I hope it didnt hurt your standing with the company.  You just reminded me to pay my internet bill! thanks!
Was it any good? Frozen foods can be weird.
That is so annoying. Youre better off buying fresh on the day even if its inconvenient. 
Are you happy for them
Its natural so its okay
I hate storms.
I geet scared that we will lose power.
thats good.. seem like a good employee
there arent a lot of dedicated people like you. keep it up
If you need to take time off then Im sure your company will understand. 
What ever need you need to do. 
Thats great. Summer classes can be tough. Because its summer
Well Im glad for him. He must be pretty determined.
Haha thats a smart strategy. What kind of things do you like to buy?
Oh I love seafood though. Its worth it Id say lol.
What was the lie?
Were you cheating?
Thats just being a good parent
Aw thats so sweet of you. Doggos can be so rewarding. 
Is he an older dog or a puppy?
I dont doubt that youre feeling good about yourself! Are you getting the lump sum of monthly payments?
Hey you cant complain about that! Who knows you may end up using your skills to win the major jackpot.
good for you
How come no one would walk with you. I would be afraid too.
Are you able to afford one?
Good things come to those who wait I know its hard now because your friend got one but itll work out for you
You should to them before you do that
Well maybe should be civil
Was the cake god? Sometimes you have to have your cake and eat it too haha. 
That sounds so yummy! See you much have needed those calories with skipping meals. Sounds like your a great baker as well.
Ugh. Thats the worst. Have you called himher? 
Thats so frustrating. Ask for a break on the rent next month!
im sorry to hear that  whant happened ?
always believe in yourself and dont let others opinions dictate your feelings 
Dont worry about it. Everybody messes up sometimes!
It just take a lot of practice but you will get there!
what was it
oh thats sweet
That is great.  Congatulations!!!! Did you get a big raise too?
It always feel good to get what you deserve!
Oh ok! Is that a bad thing or do you enjoy being single?
Oh yeah I know what you mean. Have you tried dating?
Yeah it was very different last time i tried! But I ended up meeting my partner through friends. Youll get there!
I do too its okay
sorry to hear that.. what happened
hopefully she didnt suffer.
I hate that for you
I can understand tat
Oh wow any special reason for him doing that?
How sweet of him.
Thats always so fun to see everything thats gone on in your life.  Do you have a favorite moment that was captured in a picture?
They grow up so fast!  How many kids do you have?
Sounds like you are so blessed though!  I know you must miss them while theyre away.  You have been a priceless influence on them.  They will always love you!
Thats too bad. Youre not quitting are you?
They will get over it
Thats a pretty wild story. Why do you think the aliens chose you in particular?
Well be sure to lock your doors and windows before bed tonight hopefully that will keep them out.
Oh wow thats a pretty scary movie.  Id want company while watching it too.
I get what you mean.  Some films just arent for some people.  It takes some courage to watch.
Good luck.  But besides it being scary its a good film in general.  Hope you two can enjoy it.
oh thats really nice  my friend in new york also has to do a test soon to get a promotion i hope u get it  u can do it !!!
promotions are always good more money and a better life i believe in you !!!
I think that you are absolutely right!  Thanksgiving is the best!  I love the food and family.  Are your family coming to you or are you going to the?
Is the brother from Germany coming home?
That sucks Did you reschedule?
I hate when that happens. Especially when the same people do it over and over.
Why would she do that
It wasnt Dave Ramsey was it?
Ha I took a shot in the dark. I have heard him recommended a lot for people who want to learn how to pay down debt and save money.
Have you found it?
It very well could have been. Im sorry that sucks.
That is terrible. 
I dont know. They should be locked up though. Hurting a person is next.
Oh that is nerveracking.You have to be onguard. Did they behave themselves? 
Ugh. I dont understand that either. And they make everyone so anxious just be existing. 
That would be great wouldnt it? They have it made!
Yeah but you also wouldnt live as long either. 
I know that feeling.  I have a husband and a boyfriend living here and it still feels empty.
Maybe maybe LOL.. I have four dogs.. argh!
Its nice to have generous friends.  Did you have something good?
Its nice to have a reliable person like that
I am sure he will do a good job
oh cool what was it about?
Wow thats nice how old is she?
Did they have a good reason?
Well maybe you can reschedule and do something even more fun
I am sorry how important were they
I am sorry that sounds stressful
Its always nice to visit with friends you havent seen in a while.
Im happy to hear you enjoyed yourself!
More money is always nice
Did you have fun? 
Its always nice when an event lives up to the hype. Was it at a bar or a house or where?
Thats great. I wish my daughter was determined like that.
In the classes that she likes. It is pretty frustrating for me
I hear 35 is the new 25!
I hope they dont either! Sounds like the perfect birthday celebration.
There are some apps that allow a friend to follow your progress as you home. Will that make you feel safer?
Ducks are scary but they are more scared of you than you are of them. 
Whats it about?
oooh all that physics makes my head spin
Oh love! I can only imagine the feelings you must be experiencing. Do you have a good support system in place?
Im so glad you have people to lean on  though obviously your experience is yours and no one can know exactly how youre feeling. Are you familiar with Kris Carr with your interest in a plantbased approach to diet?
Shes very inspiring  youll love her! Sending you ALL the best in healing vibes love and light!
Oh well there is always next time
Just try and keep in touch when you can
Im really glad to hear that! What kind of job is it if you dont mind me asking?
Oh that sounds pretty cool. I kind of had my eye on a career like that when I was in school but ultimately didnt go that route. What will you be doing specifically?
I bet that was disgusting! I would bring a noseplug from now on.
I love hiking I cant imagine happening upon something so gross. Would probably ruin my hike as well!
Thats really sweet of you. I hope your cat is doing better!
Well Im sure with you taking care of him hell be fine!
That does sound fun though
I hope you have fun
Thats what pictures are for. Are you guys ever going to live together?
We thats good. The photos will keep you close
The snails? Yikes. Well Ive always thought it probably gets a worse rap than it actually should and probably doesnt taste that bad. Half of why I think its probably gross is simply because they made it seem gross in old cartoons. So how did it taste?
Yeah thats true! Especially since you were on a cruise it sounds like its all a part of the experience. At least you can say you didnt chicken out. Im glad you decided to go that way because now you have a special memory tied to that vacation
Oh man I feel for you.  Kids grow up so fast.  Do you feel prepared for it?
I hear you.  I have a 8 year old daughter and it feels like she was born yesterday.  
That sucks? Did you see anything?
I can imagine. I had a car stolen once while I was at work. Broke my heart
Ive never seen it. Why do you like it?
Thats great so you enjoy looking after them?
Yeah I can understand that! Well at least they have each other and hopefully they will grow more social together
That happens sometimes. Sometimes life just gets in the way. Heck sometimes you just decide you cant physically do a night out and thats okay too. Im sure theyd understand no matter what. Maybe you can make it up to them somehow.
Maybe take a few days to think it over and then when the weekend comes think of a way to surprise them in order to make it up to them. Or if nothing else just be as honest as possible and not try to cover anything up when you need to bail on them. Theyll appreciate that the most.
I am sorry I guess some friends just argue like that
I am sure you guys will make up
I love visiting breweries! Whats your favorite kind of beer?
Not my favorite but I had a really good one the other day with some kind of fruit in it I could have downed a gallon of the stuff.
Ohhh gotta hate that friend!   What do you drive?
I drive a gianormous conversion van
In what ways do you mean?
Wow they were over 2 when I was 18!
Wow congratulations to him! He must have been studying very hard for his exams.
Im sure he has a bright future ahead! Tell him to keep up the good work.
oh dear. That sounds lonely. How are you holding up?
I can imagine. But youll make new connections there Im sure.
I know how you feel.  I moved about 3 hours away from my hometown for school and stayed for 3 years and hated it.  I moved back to my hometown and am so happy now.  Im sorry youre having a tough time.  Have you gotten out and tried to meet people?
I would go with your gut.  Sometimes things dont work out but you might just need more time to meet people and might want to hang in there.  I hope you meet a best friend soon!
That is a great friend! Im happy you were able to see your family.
She sounds like one of a king! Not many people are that generous.
Wow thats really frustrating. 
Oh yuck! That is so gross!
I do too.  We just need to take better care of the resources we have and plant more trees.  Do you do anything green.
If we could just get more people on board to do that we would be on the right track.
I am glad that he did. It is always good to stay hopeful.
Thats great. Health scares are very real and scary.
I LOVED Disneyland growing up! Did you go often? How old were you and what was your favorite ride?
Ha! I hear you on that. I also loved the Matterhorn! And the Haunted House. We used to spend summers in Tucson with my grandparents and they would drive us to Disneyland every year 
Thats awesome! What a nice surprise. And congratulations on graduating. Thats a big accomplishment. What did you graduate in? 
Oh very cool. I thought about majoring in English too but decided to go a different route. I hope your new degree helps you land the job you want! Youre now in the exciting unknown part of your life.
Just try and teach them to be more careful with them
I am sure it will get beter
Thats so nice of him to do. No one wants to help anyone out these days but Im glad for you.
Theres always Uber!
I am so sorry to hear that! Cancer is such a horrible disease.
Ive actually lost two family members last year so I can relate. Its something that will stick with you until the day you die.
Thats unfortunate. Does she know that it happened?
I am sorry to hear that. Maybe next time you can just ask her.
Best of luck to you. The tension and nerves must be killing you!
Its a tough market out there but I have faith that you get what you desire!
I am sorry you have that. It must be rough
I can only imagine
Wow congratulations on getting a new job!  I think butterflies are good to have to make us do our best and it shows your job is important to you and you want to do a good job.  What do you do?
That sounds fun. Have you done something like it before or is the whole kind of job new to you?  Good luck and I know youll do great!  Act confident even if you dont feel like it. Sometimes that can help.
Ah thats rough. That was a very bold move on your part. But sometimes fortune favors the bold as they say. I think youll be happy later on not having to wonder what if. Still though she could have maybe been more discrete about things.
Ah I see. Well its a good thing you were rejected thing maybe. At least now you know what kind of a bullet you dodged. Plus this is just another step in your overall confidence and character building. The next time you ask someone else out it will be easier.
That is very nice of him.
Yes a very cool thing.
Sometimes that can be a good thing? Its not always so bad!
Maybe next weekend will be better for you!
I hate when those come around
I am sure it will soon
you should not feel bad we all need alone time
honesty is great and all  but sometimes you need some time to yourself i feel you on that tho
Oh wow thats great! Only bad thing is he will be very busy with two jobs.
Thats great to hear!
There is nothing wrong with that at all. Ive done it a few times before. Nobody in the theater knows or cares that youre there alone.
If you always wait for somebody to come with you you may miss out on a movie that you want to see as well. So theres that.
where are you going
oh thats cool
Im glad to hear something positive happened to you. Were you able to do something fun or productive with the time off? And what was the occasion?
Ah pretty cool. Its nice that you decided to have family time instead of just alone time. I bet they were excited too. Hopefully work rewards you more often like that.
I would love to do that as well
I would love to go to hawaii
Thats great! Its hard to do that sometimes especially on the weekends!
Im proud of you for sticking to it!
Oh yeah? What kind of animal do you think it was?
Maybe it was an armadillo. I get them in my yard sometimes.
Oh no what did they say to convince you?
Maybe Im too gullible as well because that would convince me!
That is a relief. Did any coworker friends get laid off?
Ive been there. Its so sad but it will get better. 
Maybe you can change that jealous energy into positive energy! Do some research into fitness and start a new journey.
One tip I tell people is that they dont need to change WHAT they eat only how much. Calorie intake is the important factor not what type of calories.
Holy cow thats terrible. I really feel for you. My dad had that happen to him and his dog when he was young and hes told me about it as a warning to make sure Im safe with ours. I wouldnt wish it on anyone. I hope you get through the grieving process okay.
I would definitely take as long as you need so you dont put unhealthy pressure or expectation on the animal to live up to a memory it cant live up to. But if you feel comfortable with the idea then I would consider it when the time is right. Youll know when that is.
Thats great what did he give you?
Do you know why he gave it to you?
Oh no! Thats not good at all. Its hard to diagnose things sometimes
Well Im glad he got some antibiotics for it. I hope that helped enough!
Oh now thats exciting! I moved two years ago and it was a very weird process. I was happy to have a new home but anxious at the same time.
Well thats great. Im happy to hear you guys are getting out of a bad home.
Oh I totally understand.  Its frustrating when you feel like youre putting in the same effort or more! and it works better for other people.  
Well its good that at least youre making progress!  It would be crazy frustrating if you werent.  Congrats on your hard work paying off. 
Ah yes does it bring back good memories? Nostalgia is a powerful thing.
Im so glad that you had the chance to make those memories with your cousins!
That sure is embarrassing did he get talked to about his behavior? 
I agree at that age kids should definitely know better and think before doing something. Unbelievable. 
You should be proud. These are the moments you are never going to want to forget.
Yeah but dont worry. More memories are yet to come!
Your youthful vigor? You think youre too old now? Youre only too old if you allow yourself to be. My girlfriends 90yearold grandfather was a fulloflife WWII vet who lit up the room when he came in. Of course youre not as physically active but you have to learn to utilize your life in different ways.
Well maybe its an opportunity for introspection. For you to take time out of your day to think about what you need and want and what are the best ways to achieve that. Maybe you need a better diet or sleep schedule or meditation or an exercise routine. Sometimes you have to spend energy to feel energized. Its a slow process in the beginning but it can be lifechanging.
Any plans for Friday?
Thats awesome! I bet these next few days will fly by
I bet you were! What kind of laptop was it? 
My husband also has a Lenovo. He really likes it!
Wowza! Thats impressive. I wonder how long until hes called up.
You will be able to say you saw him before he was famous! 
Im really sorry to hear that... Thats the worst scenario too because youre parked and probably not even there so you were completely powerless in the situation and then you come back to your car to just have this bomb dropped on you. Maybe theres something that can be worked out since you just purchased it.
There has to be something. It cant just be this weird vulnerable loophole. I really hope so for your case because thats just unfair. Im sure your work will understand but its still a crummy situation that is probably affecting all areas of your life. Transportation gets taken for granted. Hope things get better soon.
Im so glad you got to visit with them!  I know how you feel to be far from family and home alone.  Take heart that you are loved by your family and friends even when they arent around.
I can see why its even harder on you when they leave.  Thats wonderful that they are such a part of your life.  Take care and get out with friends soon to brighten your spirits!
Thats quite scary!  Are you able to see who it is?
You might want to call 911 if they continue banging on the door.  Better safe than sorry!
Wow how long has he been juggling for?
I wonder how people figure that thing out about themselves? Very cool though.
Sometimes you just have to concede defeat. I admire your resigned attitude.
Then it was your lucky day. I usually follow someone like that and they will end up getting pulled over before me.
Oh no.  I think I see where this is headed.  
LOL.  Do you really think so?  That has happened to me before.  Sometimes its just too hard to pass up.  Thank you for sharing.  
Congratulations on making a plan and sticking with it. What kind of diet are you doing?
You can do anything realistically as long as you stay consistent and take it one day at a time!
did it bite you!
oh thats cool then
That would really anger me as well.  What did you do?  Did you find the person who did it?
Yeah it blows my mind that people think they can damage other peoples belonging and just go about their day.  
Im happy for you! Everyone deserves to be excited about life.
Thank you very much. Much success to you!
Your family was being polite. If I did that my family would order a pizza hah.
Its all good. Maybe you should try something simple like Hamburger Helper. Cant really  mess that up.
I didnt even know they were making another I loved the first!
That is friggin awesome! I sure hope they can keep up the quality in the upcoming movies.
You had a good idea. Each of us need to find the correct way to lose weight.
Wow good luck.  I hope it all goes well. It sounds like youre confident that it will. Have you done one before?
I know youre do great then!  Hope it brings you a lot of success!
Really?  That is awesome.  I used to watch reruns of that show all the time.
I will have to try to watch it.  Sounds like a good time
Those poor dogs! I hate puppy mills so much and unfortunately I live in an area where they are very common.
There are laws here but they find ways around them. People are cruel and only care about money.
Oooh I dont like owls... they creep me out
was it big
did you get to keep them?
That is awesome did you ask your boss for one or was it unexpected? 
That must mean youre a hard worker. You should keep at it then!
I hate that. Thats one of my biggest pet peeves. Thats such an awkward situation because you dont want to come off as high maintenance and ask them to stop but itd be so easy for them to have better manners too. I wish I had better advice. Maybe go to HR?
Yeah absolutely. Thats what I meant earlier too about being high maintenance. I dont know maybe earbuds? But Im sure youve tried that. Who knows how they would respond if you asked them personally and if they actually did improve theyd probably just forget and revert back in a few days anyway.
Wow!  That is impressive!  You must be really prod of yourself!
Haha!  Thats funny!  I work out to drink and eat bad food as well!  Awesome achievement with your running!  Keep at it!
Hey honest mistake. Obviously you didnt come up with some dumb lie and make it seem like they made the mistake and not you. You owned up to it. Im sure they appreciate that more than you would figure.
Im glad! Its the honest truth. Everyone screws up. And I bet it will motivate you to never make that mistake again too. So in the end they have someone whos sharper about things. Good to hear it worked out in your favor.
yes dude the world is a trip i made many friends over the years online and when i bump into them i make sure i go up to them and chit chat and shake hands you never know when someone will pass away  
i have in real life friends  and a regular job  but because of back problems and sciatica ive made many friends online i consider to be like brothers social media has let me make relationships while in bed lol
Thats so unfair. I would complain very loudly if that happened to me!
I feel your pain. Life is really unfair sometimes.
Stranger things is one of my favorite shows!  It stinks that the next season has been pushed to next summer though.
I feel ya.  The kids will be all grown up by then!
That is awesome!  He is such an amazing athlete!  Any team that has him is lucky!
I guarantee they will!  Thats raw talent right there!
wow .. so am i .. i could not imagine doing that. its great that you are going to do it though
i wish you good luck.. 
Oh my dad use to play with those all the time when we were young and hed let us touch them!
I never did want to hold it but I was curious enough to touch it! Theyre actually kind of cute.
Oh no! I hate when that happens... hopefully your computers holds on a little longer for it to go back down
Well good luck! I know how frustrating that can be
Wow why are they still shooting off fireworks? Dont they know its a one day holiday?
I agree. It must be hard to get any sleep. I feel bad for any animals in the area too!
yea i hear that... it was much better back then
that i think you are right
That is impressive. He must have been prepared well for the switch.
Good for him. It takes me forever to find a job.
Wow how exciting! Boy or girl? 
Yeah Im sure! Is this your first? 
Well congratulations! D
wow thats such an awesome surprise!
thats a great husband and best friend
Where were you at? Why couldnt you go home? Sounds frustrating.
Oh that is frustrating. I bet you were very annoyed.
oh wow.. first time going to france?
thats awesome .. i wish i could go there.. 
That sounds lonely. Maybe you should try to hang out with some of your classmates?
I hear you. At least it is only for a month. Maybe you can make some weekend trips to do fun things.
Thats hilarious!  Did you try to play it off like you meant to do that?
Well at least you were honest about it.  I bet you will never put your shirt on inside out again!  So consider it a lesson learned!
It is always good to take the time to reflect on happy memories.  I do that from time to time myself
I am glad you were able to look back fondly and remember that good times.
Oh man!  That is a nightmare!  Was your boss upset with you?
Yeah it happens to the best of us.  You just have to try and forget about it and move forward.
That is great! Do you have any fun plans?
Oh wow! That will be really fun!
whats wrong with your cat
im sorry to hear that.. she will be in peace soon enough.
That would make me mad. Did you know who did it?
Thats too bad. Maybe they could check security cameras for you.
time to look for one that deserves you
i hope you find happiness .. doesnt look like its gonna be with him.. goodluck though!
Im so sorry to hear that. What happened?
I would be heartbroken as well. You know you can always talk to me if you need to
Oh no why are all the pets dying. It is so sad when that happens.
I bet you will miss your feline friend. Hopefully they are in a better place now.
I would have done the same! I dont like snakes
I found a garden snake in my yard the other day and despite it being little it still creeped me out
That was very nice. Why couldnt you have a baby shower?
Yes that is nice. A baby shower just without the people. Still great!
Oh no! Inquiring minds want to know... is there plans for a second date?
Well you dont want to date someone who doesnt like coffee anyway. 
Thats great! How does that make you feel?
You should go out and meet friends! Go out and do hobbies that you like. I bet youll meet some new friends. Are you in a big city?
Who let him out? Did he run away?
Oh that is so sad. I hope you find him!
Oh Im sorry to hear that. Sometimes when you give up someone good comes along
Maybe you can get a pet to distract you. It could even help socialize like if you get a dog and go to a dog park
That is awesome. Your kiddo will be talking your ear off in no time.
Yeah I know how it is. My kids drive me nuts now. They are 8 and 9.
Man that sucks. Are you going to go back and return it or did you eat it already?
I say in that case dont worry about it. Mistakes happen.
That should have been scary?
Nice. How did you find the city?
It mean that you are smart.
You never know.
Thats great! I know that is an amazing feeling to have.
Thats wonderful. A car is one of the most useful purchases one can make I think.
Ouch I bet that must have hurt!
That could be some trauma there... but I am sure you will get back into the swing of things no pun intended.
That is unfortunate. Did they reschedule the picnic?
Im glad you feel better knowing that it will happen next week.
Thats awesome! How did it go?
That is so cool. Im glad you found your soulmate!
How did you find that out? Ultrasound or intuition?
Ah I have two girls too and remember the same old wives tale haha. Good luck on that boy!
Pretty names. Mine are Kaitlyn and Alyssa.
Thats awesome! I hope the visit goes well 
Oh wow so the pressure is on to make a good impression haha
Thats great! Good luck! That attitude says a lot.
Thats a recipe for success. I think youll crush it.
Wow thats a bold move. How is he getting along with that?
Thats great! I think as long as he is happy hes doing whatever is right for him.
Thats great. Im a native spaker but from what I understand English is very hard to actually learn
They absolutely do. Kids are like sponged. Its been said that its much easier for kids to learn multiple languages than adults
what kind of exam is it  and you sound confident you got this 
That is awesome to hear  preparation will help you knock this out like a champ
Thats awesome! You must have felt so proud of your achievements.
Thats good. I was never very good at math in school.
Were you doing it in a public place? Weed can do that to someone.
You may want to smoke less next time. Do it in moderation.
Thats too bad.  Have you given serious thought to trying to lose weight?
Hmmm.   I encourage you to keep trying.   Even if you dont ge tto your dieal weight just getting halfway would show trememndous progress.
That is so romantic. I also try to surprise my girlfriend occasionally with some little gifts
Such things even though may seem little have much positive impact on couples relationship
Wow good for him. Now he can drive you around.
He is moving forward pretty fast. But that means you can ride with him that much sooner.
Wow im sorry to hear that. It sucks when something goes wrong at a job youve been there long
Im glad you found a job quick! That must have felt a little good to tell them at least
Dont you hate how customer service has no service anymore?  Did you get the refund at least?
Im sorry that you had to experience that.  Its totally unfair!
What makes life so hard right now?
Very true. What would you want to do in the 60s?
Why you dont want to join the comic book club?
I understand. You could find a book club outside school.
Oh thats wonderful!  Tell them congratulations for me! You must be bursting with pride!  
Do they have any aspirations yet or are they just figuring out life?
Congrats! Time really does fly by doesnt it? What was your favorite moment from it all
Aww that does sound quite lovely. Before you know it itll be 20 years! Any special plans then?
Well studying is a good place to start. Do you feel confident about how well you will do?
Thats a good attitude to have. Good luck Im sure youll do great assuming you keep the procrastination in check!
What did you do to protect yourself?
Thats awesome! Ive never been to Colorado but I hear great things! haha
11 years is a long time I hope you have a great time!
oh that sucks were you able to get anything
wow thats great!
Im glad he was able to help.  Was the battery dead?
Yes because a dead battery is much easier to fix than a busted starter or ignition switch.  D  
Wow that is awesome! Congratulations. I am already 31 
How many people are invited? and where is it gonna be?
wow! That sounds wonderful I wish I were there too.  Are u wishing a special gift? 
Oh man long distance is hard.
Have you met in person?
So sorry to hear that. What happened? Is it something serious?
I hope the surgery went successfully and with no hassle. I had a friend who went through the same thing. Wish you all the best
Hey bro. or sis......you are talking to me now.....hope it helps some.
Just concentrate on the here and now......Your partner will be back soon.
Did he get mad at you?
Buy him something sweet like a chocolate cake it usually helps.
Its always good to go to places that make you feel younger again it brings back good memories.
Thats great never lose touch with your childhood.
That sounds fun! What system do you play it on? I havent played Mario Kart since the Wii.
I definitely have a Switch on my Christmas list! Maybe I will get myself one for my birthday.
Thats wonderful! I love those surprise visit occassions. Sadly my parents would need to fly across the country to do that and its just not feasible given my work schedule
Oh your situation knocks mine out for sure. Thats great that they did that. Traveling is unfortunatly very expensive 
Eeeek! I cant watch those anymore like I used to when I was a teenager. I bet you got scared!  Those replay in my mind over and over.
Once I was watching a horror movie a loooong time ago and the phone was ringing in the movie and then didnt work all of a sudden and then it happened to me and my friend in real life right at the same time! It was crazy but it was just a storm outside. ha ha.
Same thing I guess its hard to imagine such situations.
Im sorry. Do you enjoy having the apartment to yourself?
Thats true. I hope you find someone new to share it with.
Wow! Im actually really jealous. How did that make you feel?
What all did you buy?
Would you like to buy me something? Im just kidding. Thats great you deserve it. 
What even made you think about that?
Think of positive thinks instead you have control over that.
Dang dont you hate when that happens. What did he promise you this time?
Well make sure it is going straight to you. No drinks or smokes unless you say so.
Would you believe I have never seen a Star Wars movie? Dont hate me lol
I am a fan of GAme of Thrones though.
Right!? One of the best shows of all time in my opinion what are we suppose to do with our time?
Good choice I forgot what outside is
Thats nice. I bet he appreciated it.
Youre a good person. Everyone isnt so lucky.
Are you enrolling into army?
Well good luck its a tough life.
Thats a big time in someones life.  Do you feel ready for this new phase?
How far away will you be?
Oh man that is a long way.  Do you have family visits planned so you have something to look forward to and help you get through?
You might fall in love with it and end up sticking it out.  You never know but leaving family is hard.
Oh wow! What an accomplishment!
What kind of doctor will she be?
Oh. I dont know how medical school works. I am studying srt history.
That is awesome what kind of cat was it?
That is great make sure you pass it on to your kids as well!
im so excited for you my friend has gone twice he said a lot of people are passed out drunk on the street  and even taco bell sells alcohol very weird place
i would love going one day as well  just ignore the drunk people i bet your gonna have a blast
I just almost threw up a bit when you described it to me.  So I understand
I cannot imagine anyone wanting to drink that without losing a bet
Ugh I hate crap like that.  Why cant credit be shared?  Does it always have to be so cutthroat?
Well Alls well that ends well.  Im sure glad they were able to see through such a cheap ploy.
Hey people get what the deserve in this world sometimes.  Just be glad justice is served.
Holidays are a great time for family. I love that too.
Do you get to gether for all holidays?
What did they do this time? Kids are always getting into stuff.
Those bums. Maybe then need to be reminded who is the boss.
Thats awesome! It really pays not to burn bridges you never know when someone from your past can help you out like that.
Im happy for you. If only more bosses were like that the workforce would be a lot happier and productive I think.
Oh no I can imagine how you must have felt when you realized.  Did you get sick?
I can understand that too....  Did you double check the bread before the next sandwich?
That is not cool. I sure hope they fix their mess up quick!
I would definitely give them a bad review and try to speak to someone higher up.
Thats terrible. Was anyone hurt?
Youre lucky. That could have been really bad. Did he stop?
He shouldnt have a license.
Thats a very stressful time in a persons life but Im sure shell adapt!
Does she have a good group of close friends? Maybe shes confident because of that.
Growing up is hard at every stage in a persons life
Im glad you have a good plan for success this semester.  Did you pass last semester?
That is really good.  Ive found that a good schedule is the backbone of a good year.  It sounds like youve got it figured out.
Is the place nice? Have you seen it yet?
Well thats good. You guys will enjoy each other.
Oh no! How did you and your family do? Was the house damaged?
Hopefully that never will happen to you again that is terrible.
I can imagine you are nervous.  What will you do?
Well I wish you the best of luck.  I understand that is a stressful situation
I have never heard of silverfish but if you have to hire an exterminator that sounds serious. I hope you are ok!
That is really annoying to hear. I would be so furious if I was in your position.
Wow that is a long time. Why is it taking so long?
That is pretty annoying for sure. I hope they get moved in so they stop bothering you.
Golf? I could never get into it.
Do you play too?
Thats no good.  What did he do?
That is so annoying.  Have you reported him or asked him to be sure to close the mailbox?
Thats great. I cant wait to retire and travel
Are you goig to travel?
Its always good to start them young! Hopefully they love it and stick to it.
I agree. Kids can get a lot more out of sticking to those types of sports other than just physical exercise. It teaches them great personality traits like dedication and hard work.
omg that is so scary  especially if you took all your little ones with you that day
refund and tickets wont do anything  someone messed up big and they need to be fired 
It happens. Maybe you should hide one somewhere in case you get locked out again.
Well I had to call my landlord once to get back in my place. I know how it feels.
That is awesome for your kid! Now she knows hard work pays off.
It is always a great feeling when you see your kids succeed. 
Wow that sounds pretty special. Are you his only child?
Uh oh well only have kids if you really want them. 
Wow! He houldl do competitions. I have only seen that on TV
Must have been pretty cool to watch. How much do you bench press?
I love cereal too. What type do your kids enjoy?
Oh wow how is it expiring already?
I agree they should check their dates more closely!
Always gamble in moderation how much did you lose? Enough to get the hubby mad? 
If you ever need help with a gambling problem talk to someone never keep it bottled up.
How did it feel?
You need to get into more relationships then youll enjoy it more.
Thats kind of rude for them not to invite you. You should tell them you were hurt.
You are right. Now you know who your real friends are.
True. i think the store should introduce some policies for punishing such individuals with fines
Excellent. When i was visiting Turkey they had the same thing for carts used to carry your luggage
Forget him. There are soo many girls out there.
Why? Is there something wrong with the daycare?
Im sorry I think you are making the right choice.
Theres nothing wrong with that. Unless youre mean
Maybe you shoud pretend you are still at work until you get the hang of it.
Wow and you just walked out the store with them?
Oh I thought you stole them but Ive done that before too. Not to that extent though.
Thats sad to hear. Do you have any old pictures of it that you could look at?
Maybe you could go visit it sometime if you have the opportunity. That would be a great vacation idea.
Sorry to hear that.Are you still locked out?
Well you just have to be patient.
Why? I will be your friend if you need friends.
Take a chance and go to a coffee shop or bar.
Really?? Are you overprotective of your kids?
How many kids are you talking about?
Dont worry. Ask some help from your friends and family.
Happy to hear! have a happy home!
Im ready to meet my interviewer tomorrow.
How did it go? Was it his first sleep over?
Thats impressive for a 3 year old!  I didnt have my first sleepover til I was 6.
I have never had that. We dont have them here. Good thing though lol
I would have done the same.
Did you tell him anything?
Well its his driveway I guess.
Why was it sad?
My condolences I hope you are doing alright now.
Oh no! Why was it so bad?
That bad huh? Well Im sorry you did not enjoy it
woohooo i bet you are super excited
he should not waste this away
Oh no! Can you find a different less expensive dress? Or borrow one from a friend?
Ah well Im sorry it didnt work out. But at least you have other options!
Friends sometimes have a sixth sense for that sort of thing dont they?
Its a great feeling to have so many people who care about you Im sure!
Congrats. Enjoy it and keep yourself grateful. Its easy to take things for granted sometimes.
The bad times sometimes make us appreciate the good times even more
thats great! Sometimes its kind of hard to save up money but its good to have something saved up when things get bad
you should be proud of yourself! good job!
Awesome! I wish I was more productive sometimes. It would really make my life easier
Absolutely. If only if only lol. Maybe I should get a better alarm too so I get up earlier
Oh Ive been there! I looked like a person who cut when I used to give a lot of cat baths! Did you clean it right away? cat scratch fever
It isnt too bad mild cold symptoms usually for a few days I hope its ok! Do you cut his nails or put nail caps on? Good for bath time.
No I have not? I think it might be fun though. Have you?
What kind of robot is it? What does it do?
Is it a really good job?
Maybe you should tell him that?
What do you mean by that?
Those people need to find something better to do with their time! Get a hobby people!
Oh man! Ive been there. That is hard. I hope it wasnt too long!
Dont you hate that when people dont tell you? Well now you know your coworkers cant be trusted! But maybe they were busy and just didnt notice which is goo!
Aw so sweet! Your very welcome. Weve all been there! I completely understand. I dont think anyone saw 
did they steal anything
sorry you have to live in a not so desirable neighborhood
I have been there! Isnt it nice to feel secure even if for a little bit?
Stocking up is always good. And getting a side business in case
I bet you were really excited.
Yeah found money is always the best money.
pretty annoying jeez
if you were on the other end you wouldn
Good work. You must be feeling so healthy and fresh.
Yes you will even begin to look years younger as well!
Thats hard. Was it a bad breakup?
Well sometimes we lose things if we dont take care of them or just sometimes partners dont appreciate us either.
Oh my was the surgery successful?
I agree but always stay positive and hope for the best.
Thats sucks you should quit if they dont appreciate you.
I know finding a new job can be a daunting task but you should at least keep your options open.
You have a pet duck? Thats nuts!
What sort of things do you feed him?
It is hard! Maybe they arent right then. So many people are just not trustworthy. What have you tried?
Maybe its time to move? Try church?
Which one?  Was it good?  Ive read a decent amount of those but Im always looking for more.
Ive never heard of it.  Whats it about?
What size pizza was it? If it was a large I am not sure how you didnt get sick.
What kind of pizza was it?
Oh thats fun to hear. What kind of class is it? Are you teaching or a student or what?
Oh very cool. High school? College? I loved certain history classes. Some were hit or miss. And I was never the best at remembering dates. It always depended on how interesting the topic was.
That is a whole lot of nutrition!
Yea that sounds good. You should buy some more!
Oh no I take it that you arent happy about it?
Sometimes you have to let people make mistakes to really learn from them.
Cool. Everyonr needs a vacation. Where are you going?
The beach is a great place to relax as long as the weather is nice.
Well enjoy yourself!
I bet you are excited
That is always nice when your hard work finally pays off.
Now you should go and celebrate.
 HOW SWEET.. HAVE A GREAT TRIP 
I KNOW .. IT WOULD BE IN TRIGUING .. BY THE WAY  IS IT YOUR FIRST EVER TIRP 
Hunting fishing and computers.
I do read occasionally do you?
That sounds really fun. Are you going to go?
Oh? Thats pretty interesting! How did it go?
I wish you the best of luck! I bet you did fine
Well they are the one that has to deal with the consequences... mostly i guess.
Oh no! Well they have a lot of great deals online right now.
Yes you should be fine. You can get two day shipping and get lots of cool stuff.
Thats true! Maybe check clearances to stock up for next year soon 
Thats a sad thing to hear
Thats good of you
I am glad! Tell me about it?
Oh is it a country property?
How come? Is something wrong?
Oh I see do people bug you for money often?
I would love that! Give me that feeling 
No not really. I dont have to rush but I dont wake up too happy usually. I am glad you are having a restful time. Cherish it
I have had to do this too with my best friends My beloved dogs. It is hard. I know how you feel because I have been there more times then I want to remember. 
Minute by minute and I remind myself that my best friend is no longer in pain.
Well it is almost the fact of life that irresponsible people will not last much and regret will be only consequence for them
I think over time they will realize how wasteful and meaningless their behavior is and would start to change for better
I feel the same way! Prices have already risen on a lot including for people selling things in certain states.
I hope they do. I dont know how he hasnt been impeached yet.
Oh yeah? Its always a bit suspicious when someone just changes their attitude like that.
They didnt even apologize? Wow thats rude. Well hopefully their friendlier mood will last a while.
Oh no Did you end up lading safley.
Did the snake try to strike at you?
Im glad you didnt get bit!
Wow. What kind was it?
Are there a lot of snakes where you live?
My first time was scary too!
Was it a long flight?
I bet! My sister is happy about that too she has 4 daughters.
That sounds hectic! 
That sounds really interesting! How do you like it so far?
That would be hard! Do you now Spanish well?
The other day someone flipped out on me all of a sudden.
Nothing good. I am not talking to them again. Maybe ever. Too much of it. Its not really any fun to deal with someone who has so much baggage and childhood issues.
Did you get a good look at the guy?
that sucks.  Did they place you were at have cameras?
Im sorry Im sure you find one soon.
Just stay persistent and it will happen.
Shes lucky to have such a great kid.
Exactly we have to return the favor since they put up with us when we were little.
Oh my goodness me either!
Are you going to a Univeristy?
What are you studying to be?
Thats interesting. A lot of cool things to learn for sure.
I bet it did!
That is understandable. I have to catch myself sometimes when my kids are in the car.
If people were just more considerate of the other people around them...
That is so true.
Congrats! How is it going?
That seems very trivial but do you mean that he still doesnt seem to know you?
Have you tried counseling reading going through a program? Are there good things? I know it is hard when a partner doesnt work on a relationship and keep it good
For sure but no relationship is perfect and everything takes work
Cool. Are you saving for something specific?
I have tried saving like that but I always end up spending it. Thats bad
What play are you doing?
You can watch that play anywhere to help you practice.
How many days are you looking for the extension?
You should talk to her at least.
Did she surprise you with it?
Thats so sweet!
wow i wish i could get my kids to do that. congrats
well it seems like he is starting out to become a productive person in life
Is that something they can do?
Can they move in and then not actually buy the house?
Thats a good outlook to have! What year are you on 1st 2nd? 
Never give up you never lose if you never give up. you got this 
Thats a little strange
Used or new?
I can. Its good she achieved her dream.
Did you already make plans?
So what are you going to do? Reschedule?
What were your plans?
Weel youre not missing a concert you can go fishing another day.
That is great.  You must be an excellent parent!
He must be a good student too!
sorry to hear that.. what happened ? 
do you plan to look at getting another dog in the future?
Did you have a hard time in the class itself?
Theres a lot of people who do not so well on tests do you get another chance?
what medical test and why do you think the result couldnt be good?
Oh sorry to hear that. Hope youll get well soon.
did you take lots of pictures?
i can understand your pain.. feel the same way
Congratulations! I wish I could get a raise.
Thats so true. I would take anything right about now.
S it because they are getting bigger?
I feel you. My 13 year old is the worst.
did you get more or less ?
oh wow.. thats horrible.. our butcher gives you a sample before slicing.. i find this the best way to verify 
Wow thats great! You did a great thing by taking in a scared animal!
Its bringing a smile to my face just thinking about it!
Thats great! Make sure to always stay with her cruise ships are HUGE
lol yes stay safe and wow what an experience! I am scared of the ocean but I know how amazing it would be though!
Im really sorry to hear that  What happened? Im here for you if you wanna talk
Have you tried seeing a specialist? Or if you are religious to talk to the pastor? 
Wow you should be an avid shooter!!
ah respect for the armed forces!!. Good luck with your new gun!! Hope you have a blast
no way!!! I hope you left the house!! I would and probably would never come back
oh wow! I would probably kill that friend lol thats a mean prank
Oh my goodness thats terrible.
does she have valid reasons ?
you should probably ask to go to couples counseling.. it works if you all are both trying to save your marriage
Wow!  I hate when things like that happen.  I had a similar thing where they would have to replace the whole front body for a small scratch.
Yeah just keep an eye out for rust building up but usually it isnt an issue.
I sorry the hear that.
You should seek revenge.
what have you tried doing to meet new people?
sounds like a good mix of different crowds
Everyone blooms on their own time youll get there I promise.
How old is she? I havent experienced that yet with my daughter
Have you talked to her about it yet?
I was thinking that. I would need a day or two.
Does she live on her own?
Thats great! Most of us like our independence. 
Oh no How did happen? 
Yeah I understand your concern. 
how so ? moneywise ?
i hear that 
That sounds like fun but I would be scared. I heard they are friendly tho. First time taking care of it? 
Im more scared about them biting me.. maybe one day ill be as brave as you. 
Eww. That is disgusting
How did they put it there? nevermind. Its just too much
You should still get one.
You need to write them down!
Do you not have anywhere to hide your passwords?
Is this is first time? 
That must be a relief.
Maybe next time you should take a taxi.
i can see that.. your vision is clouded sometimes.
I understand that feeling! Was it late?
Oh man! You do not have a car?
I know. So many bills so little funds.
Oh. that has to be really stressful.
Maybe you should do something legally to protect them from themselves
I dont know what to tell you then. Ive seen it before but not with me personally
Oh lol! I know that is why I only watch stuff on the computer. More control over it
Oh yes they have some cool kids channels.
What was the reason?
Maybe you should try to speak with him again after things calm down.
Pretty good! how old is your son?
Yeah you got the best son in the world!
Thats great!  How did you go about it?
Trying on clothes is the worst.  I went through a weight loss recently and its definitely worth it in the end.  Keep vigilant to keep it off!
Are you talking about ones that just raise and raise prices?
And they always get nasty with you like it was your fault and not theirs! I feel you.
Awesome! What kind of car is it and what color?
Oh well if you can get it soon you might want to start researching 
What movie were you planning on seeing?
I understand that completely well I hope you are able to go another day that youd like
I dont think we are ready at any age to lose someone we love. I am so sorry about your Grandmother.
Take it one day at a time. Remember grief does not have a timetable. 
Oh man! I would have been so made did you say anything to them?
Some people on think about themselves! I would have said something if he didnt look the fighting type. 
Oh wow.... a grown woman wetting the bed? Does she do it on purpose?
That is weird. Im sorry but shed be out of my house! haha!
That was sweet of him!  Were you shocked because thats something that never happens?
I guess you need to go out more often so he can keep surprising you.
I know how you feel. Thats everyone family.
Me too.  There are only a couple of people I dont really like and I never have to see them because they live far away.
That is great did you study a lot for it?
Well then great job you earned it!
Its really easy if you think of it as a relative you dont really want to talk to polite and to the point
It makes sure that you dont say anything inappropriate but you still feel semi comfortable! 
Oh No how long were you out of work for? 
I am sure it was super stressful but I am so happy for you now and yes pop the bubbly! 
That sucks. I bet you felt bad. I am sure she forgave you though.
Thats good. We all make mistakes sometimes.
how often do you visit them?
That is really nice of them seems you have a lovely family when was the last time you saw them?
They announce a direct?
Are you a fan of super smash bros?
Do you like shakes? Where are they from?
That is a good question I would be scared
Oh yeah what game system do you play that on? 
Ive never even heard of that so I guess I am getting old google will be my friend later. 
That would make me mad do you have carpet or hardwood?
Oh well that is a good start then!
That is great did you offer them the job?
Great I hope they are not just a good interviewer but a good worker as well!
Oh wow Red and Blue were the best gameboy games
Never got a chance to play that one was it better?
Sorry I have not played it myself. 
Yes they do. I do love Mario Kart! I would expect the same excellence from all their games. I hope you have other games that you really enjoy.
You are going to nail it I bet. When is it? 
Read up about it on glassdoor thats a good one online! good luck  
What did you say to that?
Wow congrats then glad it worked out!
Its failed before. Just make sure you keep your hands on the wheel.... just in case.
Thats cool. Have you driven it yet?
What!  That seems really fast!  Did you train alot?  That is amazing!
You must feel really good about yourself!  I would be if I could do that.
Yeah same thing.  Theyve done so much for me that I just feel bad doing things against them.
Thats family though.  Unless theyre straight up abusive its just something you have to deal with from time to time.
Thats awesome i bet she will too! when does she start? 
woo hoo so you guys going out to celebrate? 
Are you gonna go home for the holidays?
Ah that makes sense I love snow myself but to each their own!
Really? I guess there a lot of people that think that as well. Do you still think that?
Yes I have an iPhone now and like it pretty good too. I always had Androids before but I do like Iphone a bit better too!
Yes Its very classic game. 
Good! have a great game ahead!
I am sorry to hear that I wish you luck!
Is it fully paid?
well congrats enjoy yourself!
How old are you?
Do you have a job?
I am also not sure about it
Why do you love this
I agree most jobs are painful but necessary.
I am confident that you will.
Why does that no longer happen?
You never too old to play catch!
Who did you say that to?
Oh better apologize quickly there!
Same.. for me its because i work so much and being a parent is so draining for me... i bought a new machine tho im going to start working out on friday. Try to find out whats causing it for you and take 1 step to fix it you got this! 
One tiny baby step in the right direction and everything else will fall together piece by piece!!! 
Well thats great! What a wonderful surprise too! I bet you really appreciated it.
Its nice that your parents were able to do that for you. I would have loved it too!
That is a jerk move.   What movie was it.
That sucks. Sorry your brother is a jerl.
Yikes how did that happen?
That will do it was everyone okay?
Did you study a lot for it?
Well I hope not I am sure you passed!
I like it too what is your favorite game?
I like those games too!
I was a kid then but I remember my teachers reaction
I can imagine that was a pretty big deal!
What happened in the past to make you so hesitant?
I see well keep opening yourself up and learn to let people in
Oh that sounds lonely 
How about joining a club?
did you go alone or with a group?
it sounds like its scary
Oh how exciting by yourself or with a group?
Thats awesome I have always wanted to do an experience by myself
Awesome sounds like hes ahead of f the curve. You must be proud.
Oh my goodness Im so sorry.
I hope you feel better.
What are you going to eat?
Homemade or from a restaraunt?
They do i hate that i dont know why but i always get them while in a call
have you tried calling your phone company to complain?
Well at 16 you have experienced alot of life and are ready to move on
Just be safe out there
Did you end up getting in?
That sucks but that one was worth it I am sure!
Oh no I am sorry for your loss
You are welcome keep your head up
What is the job you were trying to get?
Oh well mauybe next time!
Good for you! My husband is lucky in the lottery but Im not. But I would be excited about that 50 too!
You are probably like me already figure you lost before you scratch the ticket lol. Im glad you won!
Thats is a really good thing it helps build trust in a relationship.
Well that is the way the world works now days. Nothing like it did in the past.
Oh tell me more!
Oh I love Pikachu!
Have you considered tring to work out?
that is bad are there other options?
that is okay then but still anoying
Wow I bet you were blown away. Where was the vacation at?
I have never been there but heard a its beautiful.
thats great thats how you should be
Is it hot where you live?
I get that I am sure it is not fun regardless
No need to be jealous I am sure you are much better than him in certain areas.
I am sure you are much happier at home than he is...lol.
I dont blame you. I am always nervous at interviews. Dont worry Im sure you will do great!
You will be fine just dont make yourself too nervous!
Did you help them out?
that is for sure everyone has a ploy
Oh no. Did you fnd your dog?
I am so sorry to hear that. Have you tried calling your local shelters?
thats cool.  i hope it works out for you
im sure it will!
Thats a bit rude if you ask me.
I can see why. Some people just dont know when to keep things to themselves.
That stinks. When did you get out?
Well at least you got out
What did she want?
Ohh wow! Those are expensive I bet
Why were you irked?
Wow! what a jerk
Awesome what field do you work in?
Ha same.  Are you at work right now? 
that is awesome what is she doing now?
well good for her that is an accomplishment for sure!
Good luck! I hope it goes well for you 
How much is the house?
Awesome! Any idea what youre going to do with the money?
Thats a really good idea. Better than blowing it on something now.
OH no is she okay?
Oh great! Does she still ride?
thats nice of you what does she like?
Oh man. Im sorry. Do you still have a cordial relationship with your ex?
Have you talked to your friend?
Thats no fun. Why not?
Well you can always try to make it better. Maybe you should try to get out more?
thats awesome i bet they are thrilled
that is really cool
Oh no! That sounds so irritating. Have you tried talking to your boss about him?
Thats understandable. He sounds clueless. Ive had many coworkers like that and the best way Ive found to deal with them is run away as much as possible.
Wow Id be really nervous too. But I know you can do it!
Well is it after your lunch break? Maybe we can go out and have lunch and Ill do my best to get you pumped up for it!
Oh man Im sorry to hear that.
Yeah dont worry too much about it. There are plenty of others out there.
That sounds like such a thoughtful surprise! Did you enjoy it?
How come? Isnt the surprise half the fun?
That is terrible! Did you get it off?
Man i would get new shoes!
That sucks.  Neither did I.   I know how you feel.
I ended up getting an internship then started working at the place... never finished the degree.
That sounds terrible i would have cried!
I understand stand that for sure.
Thats great what kind of dog is it?
Oh wow I only have small dogs I cant imagine training a big dog.
Is the boss aware or does he seem to skate by unnoticed? 
Is there an HR department you can take it to?
Sounds like it might be time to sit down with the boss and discuss your thoughts and feelings. If moral gets too low its not good for anybody.
I hope it goes well! are you prepared?
I think youll do great!
Its a good way to yo keep you two together.
Has he passed?
Im so sorry to hear that. It must be stressful. Everything will get better.
Look into hotel. I feel into a hotel job after I lost my job years ago and not manage one. Its a great job. Just dont down on your self. 
I hope everything is okay.
That is a good attitude.
I would have slapped him so fast.
I would have just as mad as you are!
Wow How lucky! I love to travel.
Wow It must be a great job. I have a friend that works for a travel agency in Boston in a similar situation. She said since she started she has been to 32 different countries. 
Oh no your ac isnt working?! This is a bad time of year for that!
Man thats awful Im sorry. I hope youre able to get it fixed and soon!
Aww man.. I am sorry.  Is she at least a good person?
Karma will get here someday.
That is amazing care to share?
I wish one day that I could get a check in the mail.
Oh no! Do you have any alternatives?
Oh Im so sorry  I hope you can find something suitable even if you make it yourself
Wow thats so sad. Has he been on the list long?
Im sorry to hear your going through so much stress. My grandmother was on the heart Transplant list for about a month before getting a new heart. Maybe it will be that fast for him.
Thanks she got the heart and is doing better. Wow he is to young for this stress. Good Luck to him and you.
Im sorry to hear that.  Maybe next time?
I hope you feel better about it.
That is terrible. What did you do about it?
Did you talk to her?
Im sure. But its a fresh start. Your the new person you can make people think any thing about you that you want.
Just be your self then. Who cares what they think.
Oh no is there something wrong with your dog?
I know words dont really help in this situation but Im so sorry. Ive lost many pets and it rips your heart out. Im sure youre dog had a great life with you if its any consolation.
Oh no! Were you prepared?
I bet you will make it up next time.
What about it?
That is very nice memories.
Do you want to yell at him and call him a liar?
One time i secretly called my bosss wife and outted him for an affair he was having with one of my coworkers.. lol he never knew..
that stinks im sorry
at least you didnt damage your bike
Gross!  What did you have to do?
Disgusting!  I am sorry you had to experience that!
Im sorry they did that.  That wasnt very cool.
Surely it was just your imagination.
I can definitely see why all those things would scare you and make you think you saw a ghost.
That is great!  It is always nice when hard work is rewarded.
Well congratulations!  That is a good way to start the work week.
Oh goodness I hope you are okay.
I really understand your concern.
That sucks.  I think that happens to everyone accept the one girl who became a doctor.
Try not to let it get to you.  Life is weird.
I didnt understand.
That is a great achievement. You have been doing jousting for how long?
Oh no thats messed up!
Hopefully your insurance will help out.
Eww thats so gross.
I bet I wish some people had better manners.
Thats scary. I wonder if they made it.
Maybe you will see something in the news in the next day or so.
Wow you must be depressed. Life is short.
How is that so?
Heh thats so cute!
LOL! What did you do?
Thats terrible! Can you do anything about it?
Wow it sounds like you have a lot to be grateful for.
I am so happy for you.
Yay!  What type of dog?
I love a nice squishy face.  I have a Japanese Chin and 3 MinPin
yeah a lot like pekinese.. now you know why I have a 10 bedroom house!
Has it been on the market long?
I would be stressed each time it rains. I rented a place down state and Hurricane Sandy flooded our house. I cant imagine owning a place in a flood zone. 
Oh Im so sorry Im here if you want to talk
Aw thats terrible 
Thats good you sound very prepared and Im sure itll be alright.
Oh no that sounds scary.
Thank goodness it wasnt something serious.
That can be embarrassing.  Are you ok?
Sounds painful.  I hope you didnt cause any damage.
That is good you must be very religious.
That is very nice of you to help those that are needy.
Watch out State Farm!  lol.  Congratulations!
That is awesome.  She can drive for you now!
Oh yeah.  I just quit smoking myself.  You should try something to distract you.
Nice!!  Im trying to stay away from any form of smoking for now.
They can not curt you. They are tiny and powerless. 
dont eat them then.
He was certainly very intelligent you can definitely increase your own knowledge though if you work at it.
Try reading some books or maybe practicing math problems I guess.
That isnt good. What did you do when you stepped in the poop?
Did you throw the sandals away or just clean them?
I guess you were pretty hungry then huh? Well Im sure your friend doesnt mind sharing!
Well all you could do was apologize and offer to buy another one. Hell get over it Im sure!
Thats nice. Have you always done that?
Ive never been a person of faith. My parents werent either.
Ive never driven a truck only small vehicles! Hows that working out for you?
Aw Im glad you have something like that to remember him by. Thats a great connection to him to have.
Oh my! I really hope that you find your stuff. Do the cops have any leads?
Well I really hope that your insurance was able to cover what you lost. 
That is great. It is always good to have some recognition for the good job done.
Why would you ever move away from the Caribbean.
Where did you move to after the hurricane?
Sounds great ive never been but would love to.
How many times youve been?
Thats awesome!  How much did you win?
100 bucks still sounds great to me!
Addiction is a scary thing! I wish him the best.
Yes it takes a lot of courage to do that.
Thats nice of her its good you have such a caring mother.
Yes Im very grateful for my mother for taking very good care of me.
She takes care of me the best she can.
Your friend takes care of me the best he can.
Awesome. I was in Sturgis in 2004. Did you ride out or trailer your bike?
Lucky be careful some people can get carried away out their. 
where is it shipping from? is it a reputable store?
yeah. hopefully you will have better luck with it.
Oh no! That sounds awful! What a kind thing to do though! Im sure they were very grateful for your help!
I hope you took the right precautions not to get it yourself! I can only imagine that I have never had it and never want to!
Is it an engineering job or something else.
That is great. Would you be an astronaut then?
That is very nice of you to try to help the turtles.
That is very odd. Hopefully they wont get killed anymore.
No I havent 
I hate it when my team loses too. All that time invested for a loss is disappointing. 
Do you like your job or is this something you dread?
Well I hope you find something you love and youre happy to do. Still searching for that myself.
Which supplies did you get?
Oh that sounds like fun!
Where to? What location?
Wow you will be fine. Years ago I went to Japan to teach English and also got called to duty and spent time in Iraq and a few other places. Once you arrive its never as bad as you will have it built in your head.
I hate the summer honestly the winter is great for me.
I love the cold. it keeps me cool when i sleep.
Oh great. That is so fun . My baby died a few years ago. But he was over 14  so. 
Thanks. At least he lived a pretty good long time . He was a beagle mix named Jack.
Im sorry.. my first gut reaction was to laugh a little. I really dont mean to make fun of you. Thats terrible! Was it because you didnt want to miss a part of the movie so you tried to hold it in as long as possible?
The movie did? It sounds like maybe at least it was a good movie if thats any consolation. I hope no one made fun of you. Its a common human mistake.
I have never been to an airport honestly.
I like to stay home where I know im a little saffer.
Maybe tell him how you feel about that.
Punch him right in the nose that will fix things im sure!
Thats too bad. Are you going to replace it?
Maybe you will be able to replace it soon. What happened to it?
Thats a way to make a buck! Ebay?
You are my hero.
I see that more in the country I guess. That would be horrifying. But maybe he is just immune to pain?
Sounds like he was ok. Ive had injuries before and they werent serious enough or worth the hassle of the emergency room. But he still had to take a trip to go somewhere. Dont be afraid to care though  One person is all that is needed Kindness is always good!
Neurofeedback? I dont even know what that is! Could you fill me in a little bit? And why did you need to learn about it?
That is really interesting. Still over my head but you did a decent job of explaining it in laymans terms. I appreciate it. So are you a med student or what?
Holy cow... That is really awesome. Thats nice of you to dedicate your free time like that. I sincerely hope everything works out. I appreciate you sharing that.
oh i love looking at old photos
my nieces and nephews are all growing up on me and my step kids are almost adults too. it goes by in a blink of an eye
Oh wow!! I love pyrex stuff. I bet it brought back many memories. 
Its funny how items can bring back such good memories. 
I hope they werent expensive shoes.
Thats a shame. Does your dog chew on shoes often?
I hear you. Im not ready to go back either. 
Im sure it will be ok. A new year is a new time to reinvent yourself. 
I live in a small town with no car.
I want to get a car one day i think.
I would just go to the beach right now!
Not mine at all i enjoy my house.
 I bet that was a nice surprise. Why did you get it?
You are lucky then. Always good to receive things you arent expecting. 
Im in college so ill be your friend.
 I wish I could be with you and not in school
Did you just recently find out?
Does it upset you? Just think the family that raised you actually pursued you and love you.
Where that happened?
What did you call to get towed?
Maybe you should go by yourself. Normally wifes stay at home and clean.
Maybe if you go somewhere else without the girl.
Oh my gosh I hope you were ok!
Im really sure you will figure it out. 
Maybe pray and she will hear you.
Maybe she could if you tried.
Adulting is hard thats for sure. Start playing it and streaming and make some money.
I just read that youth was wasted on the young. lol Kind of apropos.
Its funny how you learn things as you get older even if you arent doing major things. Little things you can learn a lot from
Sorry to hear that. You sound like a hard worker which is something to be proud of even though its kind of wearing you out maybe. Are you able to roll the days over to next year and save them at least?
Thats kind of a lame policy. I hope you get to use them at some point because they should be worth something. If youre just physically unable to because of the job and its demands and then they end up passing you by that doesnt seem fair. I hope you get to relax during the holidays then.
I think Im too young for that but man wouldnt that be nice today?
Im sure they were I can barely afford to survive.
Lol. Did you dare look inside?
That is bad.  I  always try to remember how long stuff has been in there but sometimes things hide on you in there.
Weird.. that happened to me last year.  In Baltimore..
That is horrible.. I am sorry!  Mine got closed after a scandal that was on Netflix
Same here and its hard when your school doesnt exist anymore
Yeah that would be awesome!  What are you going to spend it on??
Heck yeah!  That sounds like fun!  
My weekend was pretty okay. Did anything special happen for you?
Wow! Have you always fished as a hobby? Ive never been.
ours is a family table too so i understand what you mean. i really need to refinish it
a little. i am hoping my mother in law will be able to help me with it. shes done it before successfully.
its worth it to keep a family herloom
Oh no do you know why it couldve happened?
So it could be something wrong with the soil? Ill keep my fingers crossed for you.
oh no. did you know the spirit you contacted?
i would totally freak out
I am so sorry... What happened?
Is he ok now?
Remember safety is the first priority of amusement parks everything will be just fine!
Hey that sounds exciting!!  Are you ready?
Yeah I would be pumped too!  Is it coming with a raise as well?
Oh man!!  Make sure to put some back for retirement or emergency fund!!
Do you feel negative about it or positive? Its hard to tell from your sentence. Maybe you feel both ways. If I were in your shoes I could see how you would start to feel some more pressure in that situation. I was always the youngest child so I never had pressure on me to accomplish anything by a certain time. If youre not happy about it hopefully you can turn it into a positive so that your sister doesnt get any undue negativity.
I can understand why youd start to feel that way. I think its good that you want to look inward instead of just blatantly blaming other people. That means you can start to look for ways to make you feel better about yourself that are solutions! But nothing has to be wrong with you. For some it just takes time. For others they find it easier to accept someone to settle down with.
That seems like a short train ride compared to say going across country or something! Are you going to be sleeping on it overnight?
They really do feel that way! Theres actually a train in Africa I want to say Kenya? Where it is like stepping back in time and you go on a week long journey on the train you have to dress fancy and it seems like a dream come true.
Thats awesome!  I bet youre a proud parent! 
Is he getting any gifts because hes done so goo?!
That sounds like a lot of fun!
That is cool!  I bet you all had a really great time
Was it enjoyable?
What did you do on the train?
Did you clean the house yourself or hire someone to do it?
How long did it take you to clean your house?
That sounds nice. How come you didn’t go with?
I am with you there.  I hope you get a chance to go there sometime though. 
Im sorry why cant you go out?
Oh thats not fun.
Did you ask the kid or the kids parents to stop kicking your chair?
How long was the flight you were on?
Holy cow thats awesome!  Are we taking the kids??
oh haha!  Is this your first time?
Myself as well friend i love vacation.
I do not like the beach too much sand.
That sounds fun to go to.
I love going to the movies and getting food!
Oh why did you cheat on her?
Its a mans world isnt it.
Hey thats good.  What was wrong with it?
Thats pretty awesome.  I dont guess it cost too much then.
How fun. How big was your catch?
thats a big one. I bet it was scary. Did you eat it?
Oh my goodness I bet that was embarrassing!!! 
Well it happens to everyone i wouldnt let it keep bothering you. Just laugh it off!
That is terrible.  Did you get hurt badly?
Were there a lot of people around?
Must be nice!  Do you think he will let you ride it?
I would be too those things are really nice. 
Oh that sounds like a hassle.
Oh thats not cool get a different one.
Uh oh!!  I hope it wasnt a prank lol
I bet.  I would be too!  Was the food good??
Florida is so nice. Are you going for work or pleasure?
Thats a lot of miles but they make cars good these days. 
Oh no!  Happens to the best of us.  Are you feeling better now?
Oh no!  I would hope that people had compassion for your situation and if they didnt well shame on them.  I once peed my pants at a wedding I was laughing so hard. 
Oh no! But I think black snakes are good? They eat nasty bugs and rodents!
Oh wow thats a big snake!
Oh wow what was the award for?
Oh congratulations! You are a true hero
That is so sweet.  How did he lose his leg?
Ive heard that it doesnt bother them to lose one limb.  I watch Dr. Jeff on Animal Planet a lot and that is what he says.
Im so sorry.  I have dealt with a lot of sleep problems and night panic attacks so I know how hard it can be dealing with things like that. I have a friend who does the same thing. Dont be humiliated.  You cant control it.
I hate those things!  They are so restrictive.  I wish I could remember the name of the medication that my friend is on that helped her...let me check with her and see if she texts me back.
Dont feel any shame.  The medication is called Topomax.  It supposedly stops the receptors in the brain that trigger night sleep eating.  I also know that if you happen to take Ambiena sleeping pill go off of it because it actually can cause night sleep eating. Take care!
Ugh! They do that here too! Are you in a bad city too?
Did you find out who did it?
Oh really I was unaware of that.
That is quite interesting.
Thats great. You have to buy a new one every so often as the motors get weak in them.
I love the way carpet feels after you use a brand new vacuum on it. Almost like its new again.
That sounds really dramatic! Whats the matter? Whats making you so unsure about it?
I can understand trying to abide by ones intuition... Are you going on your flight to somewhere where you have something important to do or someone to meet? Perhaps it may be unfair to them or that situation if you dont go through with it. If you want to do it try your best to think of all the repercussions and to weigh the pros and cons and to not let your intuition cloud your judgment.
I think its an adjustment you have to work through. Toddlers can really test anyones patience!
Its really hard especially being thrown into an environment with a two year old and not having them for a consistent basis from when they were younger up until now.
Oh! I hear you I love them but I get sick when I eat them. Did you do okay?
Thats unusual. Are you allergic to something they are fried in or just potatoes in general? I have digestive issues so I get tired too when I eat junk food
Thats terrible! Sorry to hear that.
So do I. People need to be more considerate of others.
Well sometimes we can feel that way in life. Relieved because there isnt drama but get a bit lonely. Maybe you can get out and meet some new people?
Well whatever makes you happy thats what you should do. But still never hurts to at least have platonic friends 
Congrats to him!  What type of skating?
Oh now I understand.  He is skateboarding. 
Oh no. Have you been stressed about anything?
You sound nervous.
I dont blame you. It can be scary...the more people there are the worse they drive. Be careful!
For sure! And always check for the wreckless drivers and the ones who cut you off Thats really bad in bigger cities. Can never be too careful.
Definitely. The world is an extremely complex thing and I dont know if well ever fully understand it.
I would imagine that people who have certain personality types are typically drawn to becoming doctors. They all seem to be very compassionate! 
Thats an interesting thing to know! Have you thought about doing it as a hobby?
If it makes you feel peace of happiness definitely!
Oh hey! A fellow bird feeder. Did you eventually get some?
Thats good. Sometimes we forget to do things that matter to us.
Thats good have you been having trouble?
Ill say. You can appreciate it that much more. What made the difference if I may ask?
Oh man the flu in summer?1
Oh geez! Was it a quick flu
Wow! Great wife Cherish her! Stack up on good vitamin C and good Elderberry when youre well to keep the flu away 
Oh god...lol I HATE being sick...When I get sick..its BAD So lets hope lol
That is great you showed the initiative to apply.  It is common to be a bit nervous.
Just think positive thoughts and I am sure you will get the news shortly
That sounds relaxing! How was the weather?
I love when everything just seems to work out together. Im glad you enjoyed!
That is really good.  In this economic climate it is good to have something like that to count on.  What do you do?
Thats great.  I am glad youre doing well.
I am so so sorry to hear that. 
I know this is so hard for you but he is in no more pain and I am sure he is watching over you
What was the drawing of?
You said that already how long did it take you to draw this picture?
Thats exciting! where are you going??
Is that a country? i know the name but not the geography.
Oh no!!  That is awful.  I hope you are okay 
I bet.  Nothing is worse than losing a friend suddenly like that.   Keep your head up friend.
Oh that is so cool! You must be a great relative.
That is awful. I would definitely not pay and never go back again.
They will lose a lot of business over that one. Word of mouth is the best way to hurt someone. That is gross and I wouldnt go back either.
That is so wonderful!  I have the same kind of husband.  Arent we lucky?  It gives me hope for when my daughter grows up and finds someone.
Oh wow your daughter is a lot closer than mine whose just 8.  I already worry about it.  I know theyll find some upstanding men but they can take their time in finding them! ha ha.
Glad you made it what happened to almost be short?
That was very nice of your grandma. How much did she cover?
I know. It was so shocking and sad.
That was a great movie!
That is good!  Why have you been feeling down about the future before?
Staying positive can be very hard but it helps to be around the right people.
OHHH! Those are nice! How much was it if you dont mind me asking?
Great! That is how it should work. Not one guy making a ton more as it takes everyone to make it work 
Why are you alone? did you just move?
Was it a significant other? was it the correct decision?
No problem! I have done it before. Oh wow! That sounds nice are they still together? I hope.
Understandable. But remember there are always private things. No relationship is perfect. It takes both working hard
Congratulations! That is awesome!  I dont really have much luck in winning things.  Have you won anything else before in your life?
That is so cool. I have been drooling over an iPad!  Is it amazing??
Oh man good luck! Make sure to have a bookmusic on hand at least to help distract you
I think that would help. Is it for vacation?
I have never seen any of the new Star Wars movies.
I have not been to the movies in a long time. It is very expensive to go these days.
Im so sorry were they impressed?
I would imagine they were quite delighted.
I totally feel for her. I have lost many the past year. Its hard
That was nice of you. Having company helps through grief.
Has something changed lately?
That is a very good attitude that you have!
What was the exam for?
When will you get the results for this exam?
I hate the dentist. It always makes me nervous. Are you going for a checkup?
Oh no  That sucks. I hope its only one
Oh that is fantastic!!!  I bet youre proud of him!
Thats pretty cool!  You sound like an awesome grandparent! D
That is cool did you teach him how to fish?
I am sure he didnt let you hear the end of that.
that sounds like a nice sunday
hopefully it happens again soon!
wow thats a huge pain
i know what you mean
I hope so! I hate driving but good luck.
Good thats really important thing.
Thats great! Congratulations! Thats exciting and Im sure if youre confident she will then she will!
Oh okay. Well that is a bit different but good luck!
Im sorry.  It sounds like you had a tough life.
I could not have said it better myself.
Oh lord why did you do that?
You pay your gramma back and stop drinking. Seriously
How are you ready?
What kinds of snacks do you have for it?
How did he win a lot of money?
Does he play the scratcher tickets a lot?
oh yea something else insane?
that makes no sense.
O that sounds delicious any idea what youll get?
Sounds delicious get some queso too!
Sadly I agree with you.  As I get older it seems like that more and more.  What happened that made you feel that way?
Its so true! I battle chronic illness and excruciating pain daily for almost 14 years now not to mention drowning in old medical bills.  I put my faith in God and pray for relief.  Its really hard to stay optimistic.  I really hope life improves for you and you can enjoy and embrace life again.  
That is exactly what Ive been going through along with horrible doctors that did nothing for me.  I just went high nutrient vegan 3 months ago and am improving my leaps and bounds.  I follow Dr. Joel Furhman.  You can keep going and your journey is giving you compassion for others that are going through horrible things.  Take heart and I hope you feel better.  
I hear you! Its sad yet happy to think of how great it was years ago! I hope we get to keep our good memories when we leave this world
I know right 3. Such a great time when we werent the adults as well! lol Paying bills is no fun.
How were you dancing?
Were they expensive pants?
Why? Are you scared to ride it? I can relate so if thats the case just skip it.
Oh I see so its kind of a haveto scenario. Well I always let my hubby do that but maybe youre the hubby too lol. 
Sure! If youve never ridden it then you really should. 
You are very lucky you didnt crash your car while driving.
Yes how much did it cost to fix the tire?
it looks like its going to be good!
Me too... those are my favorite type of movies
Oh goodness what happened?
Oh no you must be devastated.  Im sorry.
Ohh gosh! What happened. Thats so terrifying
Oh I feel sorry for you.
Thats good do yall live in the same town?
my mother lives far away and I live with my father but its not ideal
Oh my god that’s hilarious. 
Oh no I am so sorry about that. Did everything turn out ok?
Oh what caused them to move out?  Is that a good thing or a bad thing?
I see. Im sorry youre home alone.  I get lonely myself when youre used to someone around.  Are you going to advertise for a new roommate?
Do you have any children already or will this be your first?
Do you know if it is a boy or girl?
That is irritating huh.  It is like a kid that cant stand not having the attention for a minute so they act up.  Haha
It just wants you off the phone instead.  
I hope you didnt drink the soup. They better of given you the meal for free.
Oh I thought it was a t a restaurant.
Nah.  Dont worry my friend!  It will be okay!
I dont think they will.  We are the worlds greatest army
What position does your nephew play?
Is your nephew a big kid?
Oh no! What did he do?
Yes little brothers can sometimes be irritating.  Maybe ask him next time to turn it down?
Where did you go? You went alone?
That is awesome Ive been there when I was a kid and had a lot of fun!
That is crazy! what was your original major?
How are you faring in todays climate?
Thats not good what is the contract dispute about?
Yeah thats always rough. I would take them to court if its in the 4 digit range.
I havent been.  I would really love to go and its good to hear such a good review from someone.
What else is there to do there other than see the falls?
Good for YOU! Integrity is very rare nowadays
I feel the same way!
Did you cry when you were looking at the photos?
My niece lives in Los Angeles. I do not get to see her very much.
That is wonderful!  How many kids do you have?  Thats a tough job but so rewarding!
I have 2 kids.  I love being home with them as well. I am blessed to be able to work at home.  I also homeschool them and love teaching! Are you having any more kids?
That is awesome!  How long were they away 
Great! What kind of job is it?
Sounds great! Better pay is always good!
That is a great surprise.   I bet you are very thankful.
Do you know what you are going to spend it on?
I would not want to be in your position its ok to help but all the time it can be dreadful. 
It will get better put your foot down and maybe say no in a nice way to not step on any ones toes.
Thats awesome! congratulations too!  What do you do?
Oh nice! My brother in law is a lawyer and I remember him trying to get certain jobs he wanted and it not being easy sometimes.  Sounds like you are a great lawyer.  Hope it goes well for you!
Wow congrats! What type of music do you play?
Nice I really like folk music. I hope you guys put off a great show.
Oh what a scene. How did it make you feel?
You are so lucky to have a family like that!
oh my lord please say thats not true.
that is one of the most horrible things ive ever heard.
I would be mad! Did she say why she didnt bring you anything?
Maybe you could talk to her after you calm down a bit.  Im sure there is a reason.
Aw Im sorry.  Why are you lonely?
Maybe you could invite a friend over for a movie?
Maybe you could facetime your wife.
That sounds really frustrating! Who mows their lawn that early holy cow!
Wow I would be mad to. 
Gee that is too bad. I wonder why Becky got it and you didnt?
Yeah thats no fun. Maybe youll get offered the next promotion that is available? 
What day is that?
Oh lord..that gives me chills just hearing the word. What was it on?
Do you have more than one dog??
I feel like this is obvious  but is he white?
That sounds awesome! Ive only ever been to Florida in order to get to Disney World. Are you there to visit family? Business? To sightsee?
Yeah... I had to do a long drive from Nebraska to Colorado this summer. It was about a 7hour drive. That was starting to push it. So I could see 9 hours being a little rough. I just tried to load up on podcasts to listen to.
Oh thats awful!  I hope he is going to be okay.  Did they lay him off with severence or anything?
Yeah.  He will get to spend more time with you all now!  Take the father on a vacation!
I lad you was ok did anyone help you or was you embarrassed? 
Now that was mean and cruel nothing funny about that best outcome is you are fine be careful next time.
Oh boy.  Thats no good.  Did the credit card company alert you or did they miss it too?
I bet.  I cant believe they didnt alert you.  Were they able to take care of it for you and suspend the charges and the account?
Oh goodness is she okay?
I really wish the best for yall.  Good health.
That was nice of him. You should take him out for dinner.
That is impossible thou. It is a dog eat dog world out there.
Congratulations. Do you have any party planned for this event?
That is cool. Are you going alone or with friends?
You shouldnt let those kind of people upset you.
Maybe you should move out? Have you thought about that.
Oh! Yeah I understand that maybe they will take you?!
Oh yes of course! I am sorry.
Thats so nice. Is he doing better now?
Im sure it was a great comfort to you. Food is a great way to tell someone you care. 
Thats great. My mother is like that too and its easy take for granted but not all are so lucky !
You sure are! At least you appreciate and acknowledge so Im sure she is pretty glad to have you as her child.
Yes all the time! My girlfriend always thinks Im so weird.
Im sorry to hear that. We all have our demons. Sometimes its good to take one day at a time and try to stay positive. 
Good to hear! What is the subject?
Thats something to be proud of! Good job!
Im not sure what that is. Tell me about it?
Oh okay I believe I know what you are talking about now. He is a good actor and usually his movies are great!
I hope you wasnt to disappointed was you to going to spend time together? 
A simple call would have been nice hopefully he has a good explanation for this. 
Can you really put a price on pizza?
I understand  If a pizza is more than 10 dollars im not paying.
That must be so annoying.
Im sorry maybe one day when he gets older.
Oh no! I hope you didnt have to go anywhere the next day? Did you try anything to help?
Oh well thats a bonus! No one needs sleep on christmas lol
Cant you just live with someone?
Well dogs are good for protection.
That stinks. Did you hurt your foot?
I read that wrong I thought you said you tripped over a vase and it broke. Will you be in trouble if she finds out?
Oh no!  Its always tough in relationships but when you cant go see her or make her talk to you afterwards Im sure its extra hard.  Did you call back and tell her that?
Im sure once she calms down she will look on it as not as big of a deal.  If you have to work you have to work.  I hope you can work it out!  
Hahaha. Im so sorry but that made me laugh. I really dont mean to make you feel like Im thinking youre dumb because I dont. Everyone makes that mistake. I have an old Honda Civic and I run into that problem too. You probably gave the locksmith a good story to tell and made his day. Hopefully you can smile at it tomorrow.
Oh man he didnt charge you? You both kind of won then! A good story for you both at no cost. Well except for time. It was a good learning lesson. And yeah.. the bumper sticker.. thats crazy. Im glad youre able to not take yourself so seriously. That makes for a great personality.
Oh well I guess that was a bit disappointing huh. Well maybe you can go real soon.
Oh well youre going to have to say Mom I know youre tired but I really want to see this movie can we please just go? Itll be fun we need time together.
I understand.  Tell me about it.
Yes one day at a time.
Woo hoo! What were you promoted too?
Thats great! What kind of tasks do you do?
Thats an interesting way to get attention. What spurred that on? Was it a dare or was he just feeling wild?
Interesting.. Did he get in trouble? Was this at a high school or something? And does he take gymnastics?! Back flips are hard!
Do you guys fight often?? How do they usually turn out?
Are your political views the same? and do you think this next fight will end well?
Im really sorry to hear that. Whats worse is the best thing for breakups the only thing that really helps is time passing by. But the people who are hurting in the moment they cant really understand or accept that. So you feel like you have to help and do something when in reality its probably best you dont smother them and that they have space. I hope she feels better though.
Yeah thats a good idea. Thats always a solid way to go about it. My roommate had a breakup 6 months ago. I tried not to give any advice that was too specific because the best solution always has to come from that person themselves. My roommate ended up just focusing on himself as much as possible diving into artistic endeavors trying to work out etc.
That is disappointing. Did you confront them about it? I am sorry you have to deal with that.
Thats too bad. Lesson learned I guess.
That sounds stressful! How far did you move?
Thats quite a ways. Do you have any hobbies that could help you meet new people?
Well thats wonderful and I know it really is so great to hear your childs first words!
For Sure. Before you know it hell be saying full sentences!
That is always true. The saying goes..water your own grass.
Find some good books and good therapy and make your life what you want it to be. If you truly love your partner then dont lose them over feelings. Feelings are fleeting.
Yeah I do. Im in a long distance relationship. I get that everytime I have to fly back home. I hope you start to feel better though. Loneliness can end up being a good motivator however.
Ah your situation sounds complicated. Im sorry you have to deal with that. It sounds like youve given a lot of thought though and the way you lay it out you sound very mature about it. Youve developed a good perspective on it one that I should learn to appreciate myself. With your temperament Im sure you wont suffer from loneliness very long. People will want to be around you as long as you want them around you.
You sound like youve dealt with more hardship than the average person. I wish I could empathize with you but Ive been lucky to avoid that kind of thing recently. But I do hope things will turn out differently for you soon. If anything these things will make you more resilient than the average person too. Thats not worth nothing.
Do you feel their weight?
Sounds exciting. Will you do it again?
Are they usually a winning team?
Oh wow  I hope they do well.  
Wow that must be scary to have to trust someone else with all of your stuff. What took you out of the country?
A two month vacation sounds amazing! I figured it was for work or something when you said two months. What is your favorite thing to do in the Bahamas?
That is worrisome but also exciting. Is it your first child?
Congratulations. I wish you the best of luck. Parenthood is a blessing.
That sucks how old was the goldfish?
What did you do with Goldie after she died?
Aw.  I bet that is so bittersweet. Do they graduate next May?
That is a good sign!  I know many kids that age who have no direction so it sounds like hes really going places.  Do you have any other kids that will still be at home?
What is the certification exam for?
My father was an architect. So I have heard about these exams.
I hear you! Life is SO busy never enough hours in the day!
Oh lol! Its ok you are a mom and its the hardest job EVER and very thankless. You are doing good
Yes I do hate being all alone. Thats how I feel when my boyfriend leaves town for work.
Yes you have to do what is best for yourself. Take care of you before others.
Right on that sounds cool. Did you go with family or a date? Or maybe just hung out there alone? Thats okay too. I love Italian food had always wanted to go to Olive Garden but my dad hates Italian. So when we were growing up we just never went. Now that Im on my own Ive been... twice. Both times they were just okay.
It can be cheap to go there sometimes for an easy filling meal with the deals and coupons they have I think. With the bread and soup you can get. I hope you guys had a good time! 
Im sorry the hear that.  Maybe another company would appreciate your talent.
The first job out of college is a good way to test the waters but someday you will have to spread those wings.
Just take your time and dont get so nervous you got this. 
Great to have some hands on help parallel parking is very hard but once down packed it is easy.
Thats ok.  Employers dont look at your grades I dont think.
It sounds like you have determination and that is worth more than a 4.0
Yeah it should be a good one. Who is your favorite team?
Hope Dak has a good year! I am all about the tailgating.
That must have been somewhat weird.
Oh goodness that is so creepy!
That sounds so exciting get ready for sleepless nights and long nights gambling. 
Know your limit once you start gambling it will make it much easier so you wont go broke.
Im sorry but I dont envy you... Ive always just driven a little sedan. Im an alright driver but if I had to drive something bigger Id be nervous too. Too easy for me to make mistakes. I kind of dread the day where Ill have to drive a big Uhaul truck. I hope things go well for you though.
Well as long as youre patient and careful youll minimize your mistakes. There are those who go out there and think they know everything. Even if theyre a good driver they may be more likely to slip up and have a problem than you would. So just stay positive!
Maybe you can observe what shes doing and use that to advance in the industry as well.
Id be worried about having these kinds of feelings towards your wife.
That does sound creepy. What did you do?
Clowns are scary. Did you make it out safe?
Oh that is pretty cool. Were there any clowns there?
That is good to hear. I like the ones that are funny better.
Did it turn out to be a great event even though the bands was unknown? 
That is good to hear I would enjoy a night with some great music. 
That sounds scary! What was it?
Oh no. Are there other people at home with you?
That was nice of them. What movie do you want to see?
You should see 8th grade. Nice story about a girl growing up. You will like it.
That is very impressive. Do you know what languages they are?
wow I bet Chinese is one the State Department really needs right now. I hope your friend gets the job.
Wow. You can wear yoga pants to work? Id like that dress code!
Ah Im glad thats over for you then. Now youre less likely to forget doing laundry again.
Oh no are you worried about her? Do you think she will be faithful?
Yes I agree guys are a little let reliable sometimes. 
Wow. That is impressive! I cant even do a cartwheel on a mat.
Maybe she is part kangaroo afterall.
AHHEM! What I meant to say prior to my keyboard malfunction was...that sounds really neat! Where are you going to go camping?
People really need to be more respectful. What did you do?
He deserved it that scumbag.
That is scary. I hope she wasnt too shaken up from it.
That is very true. Well I am glad she is OK. Thanks for sharing about it.
It must be nerve wrecking especially since it has so much impack on your job.
Try to stay calm and do your best. Good luck!
That sounds exciting! When are you going?
Its good to focus but surely you can take a few hours to take in the culture.  China has a long and interesting history.
i hate that!
hahaha...aww..cant give away the pupper
Thats too bad. Whats Your favorite dish?
Those are really good. I am more of a burrito man myself.
thats amazing! where did they take you?
you are very lucky  is greek your favorite food?
That is awesome. Did you get to do anything fun with her?
Cool I like Harry Potter. You have a really nice aunt!
Congratulations! Any plans to lose more?
thats great. were you losing for a special occasion or just to feel better?
Oh.. i am so sorry to hear that my friend.. I understand your feelings. Have you thought about getting a new pet?
I feel you.. When my pet dunken passed away i got a new dog named him dunken and restarted our relationship from there
Thats awesome! And crazy... And scary... and awesome all at once! You must kinda feel accomplished though huh? Good to hear that everyone is happy and healthy. Kind of weird how you all will have that special unique bond for the rest of your lives now. 
Its funny you guys walked into work that day and thought itd be another usual boring day. You clocked out maybe with some blood on your shirt smelling like newborn. Awesome.
Wow. I definitely would take it up wiht your credit card.
They really should be more considerate. allergies are a serious medical concern.
What happened? Did you ask her to go out on a date?
Yeah that happens all the time with me. Well actually it doesnt since I cant text because I wear Hulk Hands all the time. I just smash things.
Wow. Why did he do that?
If he wasnt happy with the food there arebetter ways to tell you.
Not sure what an emu is. I hope you find himher!
Maybe she just wanted to go play. I hope she comes back.
That really sucks. That would have been an instance to cry over SPILLED milk indeed!
Never thought about that. Thank god you recovered it!
that is awesom!!!
hahaah...thats too cute
Aw thats so sweet of you. Did it work?
Thats really nice. The world needs more people like you.
damn dog  thats disappointing to here 
 i would be really angry
Sounds impressive. Did you finish all of them?
Thats really good! Did they give you a raise?
Nice! How is your business doing nowadays?
Thats really great. I am proud of your success.
oh my lord! only ten?
I think you can do it! I mean is there really a limit to the amount of bigmacs one can eat?
Oh that sounds wonderful! Are you going to visit the zoo?
I here they have one of the best zoos in the us.
Thats really bad but really good that your faced didnt turn out scarred for life. 
True. It is quite terrible to have acne. Mine is so bad that I cant even see.
Thats so nice of them. Was it your birthday?
Im glad you had such a fun time.
awww thats good news!
im sure the pupper was happy!
Thats awesome! I hope you get the good news soon.
Early congratulations to ya!
thats awesome  and happy birthday !!!
what kind of gifts did you get ?
Thats really good for you. What kind of job do you have?
That sounds like a really neat job. Are you going to get a promotion soon?
Thats great! Good for him!
That will be exciting!
lol.  Maybe you should talk to them about it!
Yeah I understand.  Maybe you should pay them back by interrrupting them?
Thats too bad. Do you have a new job lined up?
I hope you find one soon. If you dont you are more than welcome to come work in my sweatshop in Siberia.
Oh that must be such a relief.
Did the little guy even feel guilty for running away?
You cannot enjoy bowling all alone. It is a group game. Dont you have any friends to invite?
What happened? Is it something because of you or him?
I have a Chase credit card. They really arent that great but I do hope you get approved. Why do you need it?
That sounds like a smart plan. When do you find out?
that is such a sweet story.. congrats to both of you
it is so nice to see a marriage as strong these days!
That sounds awesome. I didnt know such places existed.
Do they serve coffee? Like starbucks?
oh i see.. how did you do?
way to go! as you know hard work always pays off
Oh no!  I bet it smelled bad.  Did you clean it up?
LOL its been on the carpet for a few weeks???  Clean it up already.  She wont do it
Thats really swell! What lake did you go to?
I am happy that you had a great weekend. I should really check it out myself sometime.
Wow. It can be difficult to put together but finding the parts is a lot of fun.
I think if you show that you put in some effort yourself first she wont mind.
Wow. You were either very imaginative or upset.
Thought that reminded me of Death Note but I think L only focused on criminals.
Thats kinda bad. What did you lie about?
Well I suppose it is justified as long as you dont do it all the time.
Thats good. Where did they find it?
Is that how much doritos and a mountain dew costs there. geez
thats the same thing happening at my job  super lazy worker just walks around and hides in the restroom its annoying
yes it does i wish people like that would just get fired 
That is horrible. Did you find out who did it?
I think you should have put them in a difficult to reach for babies place
Oh no did you go on time? 
Just leave it. Try to be punctual here after.
I love flowers thats great!
Wow that is some fast growth.
i have heard good things about that show.  are you a fan?
is it going to be the last season? thats too bad.
That sounds very nostalgic.
Love was so innocent back then.
Oh geez that is certainly cause for alarm. Did you summon the stoop kid?
Ah there is your problem right there. 99.9 of the time a stoop kid will chase away nasty pigeons no problem.
I never took the ACT
I meant SAT. I took the ACT. how did you do in the end?
Is that not funny? I think its hilarious
Interesting. What lead to that?
Were you guys close when you were younger?
Man its so much fun to just have a good conversation with people. 
Thats no good. Why are you upset with them?
I would be equally as angry. I think I wouldve put them up for adoption.
Why put ramen in the fridge?
How are you  doing in college? because that is ridiculous lol
Awwww yeah! ...what exactly is on?
Yeah! Come on over here and well throw a regular ole pizza party!
Can they not afford ramen?
Id vote you class president!
corn dogs are yummy. where do you get yours from?
ew. that sounds bad. but if it was free i guess thats a good thing.
Thats no good. Why did you feel like that?
Oh no. Who was at the door? Was it a mime?
Oh no I hope you pardon them. 
This is too much of punishment for kids.
Oh that really cool.. I bet it was really complicated huh?
It is always awesome to see a genius at work. a glimpse into their passion
Oh no.. I hope you was not hurt
I can understand that. Dont feel bad it happens to the best of us buddy 
Oh no! did you file a police report?
is your insurance going to take care of it?
Oh yeah? Ive been looking for a new show to watch. Which one is it?
Dang! I should start watching it. I love Stephen King.
Shame on you! What did you buy?
You should have bought ramen lol
Thats great! Are you going to be in the wedding?
Thats too bad. When is the wedding?
is that a baseball stadium?
Oh Well have fun
Oh my gosh! Are you ok? I would be sick.
Yikes! Maybe you shouldnt do that again.
Aw man Ive been there before. Dont regret it one bit. More food for us right?
Nah youre good man. You probably did it for good reason.
That is terrible news. I am so sorry.

Oh so where are you all going?
I have no idea where that is but it sound exotic

You must have some fond memories of that.
Im sorry.  Hold on to the old memories.
Technology is not perfect
Did it take you into a lake like michael on the office?
Uh oh!  What happened?  Did you end up wearing it?
I bet your audience missed out!
What is the matter?
I love rollercoasters!
I feel sorry for him too although I dont know what for. Can you refresh my memory?
Ah yes I remember now. That mother deserves to be hanged.
Oh no is that a bad joke?
Dont feel so! Forgive them

Real life doesnt have happ endings like that

Thats always so annoying especially when they overeat and waste food.
My cat does that all the time so I feel you.
Sounds awesome! We have a fitness center locally that offers tanning beds and massages.  i was thinking of joining just for that.
I wish you luck and make sure to stay hydrated.
Thats awesome! I love hearing stories like that.
Hopefully the pizza is just like you remember!
Sometimes it is nice to look back.
Yes I would say it is bittersweet.

brown eyes arent bad
I would have kept it!
Im sure you were money is good to have.
Well done you studied for it and passed!
Thanks amazing! I know you have a bright future ahead of you
Oh no who was it?
Aw no I have a cat and I really dont like thinking about him dying. Sorry to hear that.
Why did you get a ticket then if it was for no reason?
Thats absurd!  Too bad there arent any cameras around to prove your innocence!
You dont like roller coasters?
I think they are tons of fun!
That is a very good wish to have buddy
true. in other words you want to make them financially stable
I never leave my house! Much less play sports!
I love it inside where the AC is!
So you and your dad didnt have a great relationship? Or did you mean to say hat?
Aw well at least you have that to eternalize him.
oh no.. why was the kid sad did you find out?

oh.. why did you do that?
Did you tell him and pay him back?
thats quite nice
thats super awesome
I never even carry a wallet any more!
I just use the back of my phone which holds my cards.
I know they have so much talent too!
Unfortunately  I have gotten used to it.
What did you do about it?
I would not have done that did he hit you?
What are you saying? 
I cant believe this! are you serious?
What type of project is it?
I do all of my business digital.
That makes sense since your feet are likely gonna smell too.
I guess just take a spare pair with you!
I could not even imagine how you would have felt.
I do not like to be sad.
I sure hope so.  It is making me a little blue.
Yes I agree.  I have flowers and they need sun and rain.
I have already done that and it is usually so depressing.
Its good to get everything you need but I hate school in general.
I understand that completly i also do not have a car.
One day you will own many cars.
Oh wow thats lucky! So they are paying for everything?
Hopefully you get there then so that you can repay them!
That is truly magical.
I would never ever cheat on anything!
wth thats crazy
you should john wick them
I keep my money in the bank never in a wallet!
I understand you have to go and get another one.
Do you?  Me too!  Which one is your favorite?
Oh.  I thought you said like at first.  Im sorry.  I like them!  You should try watching more of them!
I have never been but i would be very unhappy about it.
I would be careful it might break any time!
Thats good to hear! What kind of car is it?
What brand of car is it then?
I think in person would have been better!
Sometimes things are much better face to face.
I do not drive at all i stay home.
Stay indoors and no need for that!
Oh yes I love taco Tuesday!
That must be a proud tradition. 
NIce! Where are you goin?
That sounds fancy. I like Texas never been there though.
I dislike football very much.
Im sure he will do great things for you.
Aw!  How come?  
lol what does that mean?  You should find a good hobby! 
Thats great! How much did they win?
Thats good.  I bet he was happy.
Oh thats exciting! Have you gone before?
Thats true the experience is different when youre older.
Trips are very expensive to go on.
Food is so expensive these days.
So sweet Its good to have pets with us.
Have a happy life with your pets and enjoy with them.
I only like american food!

Thats good to hear. What subject was this in?
Math is the worst sometimes especially when you see the test and panic since you know nothing.
Oh no! Im so sorry to hear that. Was anyone hurt?
I know its hard to lose your stuff but it can be replaced.  At least you are ok.
Oh no! Did they reimburse you?
Im sure it is.  I would be furious!
Wow congrats on my behalf.
Its lovely. Be a happy couple. live long together!
Oh no!  Did you call the police?
Was it an accident? or on purpose?
Why were you surprised? Is he shy?
Some girls like a certain type. Or maybe it was written in the stars.
Thats so sweet!  I bet he is an awesome dad!
This is true.  Did you have some good memorable times together?
Thats good.  Im glad to hear that.
Oh cool! Where are you gonna do that?
Oh yeah they are safe 99 of the time
Aw Im sorry. Can you retake the class?
i understand. Those classes are expensive too.
How cool! What did you think of it?
Wow hopefully next time it may taste better!
Thats a wonderful thing to hear!  Did you get through college?
I bet they are!  You should take them out to dinner to celebrate!
Youre welcome and congrats on graduating!  Thats such a great accomplishment!
Nice! Where are you going?
That should be a good trip for you.  Ever been there?
Wow that is absolutely tragic to hear. Thats so cruel of them.
I hope you guys were alright?

Thats great I happy for you. Its a positive step.
Whys that? Something important?
Oh wow thats exciting! Im happy for you.
Aww.  How do you feel about that?
Yeah I bet.  Hey at least youre out there trying.  Thats all you can really do.
Me too! I like to win I guess that makes me competitive.
It is a good thing it gives you an edge.
Oh yea? when is the trip?
I bet you are going with a loved one thats why you are so anxious about the trip
oh yea did you do a good job to get one?
thats great nice job
Why what happened? Hopefully nothing bad.
Dont worry Im sure you did fine.
I know what you mean that has happened to me before and it is an awful feeling.
It probably isnt I really hope it isnt too.
Sorry to hear that. What did your friends say?
Hopefully your friends make it up to you!
Yeah isnt that awesome!  What kind of dog do you have?
Aww thats so cute!  Does he do any tricks?
hehe how adorable!  Give him kisses for me!
What is your test about?
Oh nice I worked at a pharmacy while I was in high school and I loved it. I thought about getting that certification. Is it hard?
wow that is such a special occasion!what a gift
because you witnessed it.
Oh thats exciting! Are you gonna propose or what?
That sounds so nice I wish I had a long term relationship like that!
Oh thats good 
Its always a good thing to turn things around
Was a happy shocked feeling or a bad one?
Thats great. where was the trip to and who with?
oh really why is that?
oh dang thats a real thinker
I know that feeling. I get it when I feel anxious.
Have you tried yoga and meditation? It can help.
Oh no so sorry. Was your son okay?
Thats so unfortunate. I hope he learnt hes lesson. On the brighter side is that your son is okay.
sounds super fun
Oh thats awesome!  Where you going?
Cool!  Ive never been there.  Are you excited to go?
That sounds terrible. I would expect nothing less for a presumably high cost hotel. 
Thats good but should also be standard for any hotel nevertheless a 5 star one. How was the new room?
You must have been rather disappointed. But its the thought that counts.
True they only want the best for us. Sometimes that can mean making hard decisions such as foregoing the bike.
Oh cool! What job does she work?
Thats really nice! Glad to hear that she is moving up the ladder!
if its someone you know you should ask them not to do it again
oh thats bad!
I bet they will.  Thats the way to look at things.  With some optimism!
Yeah.  Well I wish you luck my friend.  Keep your head up!
Ohh thats nice. May I ask what for?
What an amazing women. She must be very strong.
Im not one to judge. We all have done things we regret in the past. Why did you do it though?
Well I guess you learnt a valuable lesson just dont do it again.
yea i know what you mean
yea it sucks to think it might fail
Wow thats really nice of your father! What type of car did he get you?
Thats nice that you can depend on your father.
Oh my what movie was it?!
You must have had trouble sleeping that night!
Sounds like trouble. What did he do?
Thanks that was very helpful.
it is alright
Im glad that I dont have to deal with any of that for a few more weeks of summer vacation.
Well I hope that you do well on that exam!
wow i can relate feels goof knowing you will do well so you can not worry about it
i bet .that is always a tough situation.
are you still civil with them?
Congratulations! It must be exciting to live on your own!
Its nice to have company and make close friends during college.
Oh thats always nice. What made you feel that?
Aw thats funny I always love those kinds of heartwarming moments.
I can imagine it can be stressful!
Yes and fortunately you will have many more!
awww how cool. what was it?
that sounds very cool!
Aw thats annoying when my cat does that too.
Especially when they seem to do it in the worst place possible.
yea i know what you mean austin should share
Thats awesome. B is great and youll smash it next time.
I guess to keep on trying and dont be so hard on yourself a B grade is good enough too.
Give me an example of something that happened then.
I know what you mean Im really really shy too.
Sometimes it just gets a little overwhelming. There can just be too much going on at once especially if you have more than one child.
You just have to do what is best for you and your family. One day your kids will understand especially when they have kids of their own and have so many other things going on.
that is a very good achievement to hear
what do you do for you to become the best employee?
That is true
Medics are life savers so you must trust them with your life
Which class was that? Im glad to hear that.
Im about to go into that same class so I hope I do well too.
yea i loved doing that all summer
same its quite cool
Thats great! What job did you get?
Thats the same kind of job that Im looking to get so thats awesome!
You need to wipe away the guilt and seek forgiveness for yourself.
Yes stealing is a bad act but now you have learned your lesson!
Oh no! What had happened to you?
Thats a tough situation. I hope you are able to make the best move for you.
me too I love them and I am very excited as well
I know theyll make so much money from it within the first week of release
i know what you mean i wish i had either
yea i know my friend max has that too and i would like a girlfriend but its tough
Thats so painful. I hope it didnt hurt for too long.
I know what you mean it can linger sometimes.
i know how you feel
thats an unhealthy way to think but its hard to avoid
Thats not nice for you. Did you try meeting people?
I know exactly how you feel as Im one too. Keep at it though as deep within us theres a great spirit there.
did you enjoy it?
what was the movie about?
Its excellent. My hearty congrats to you!
have a excellent career ahead to you!! 
I agree nothing like seeing them smile and have fun!
Yup. Enjoy it whilst theyre young! 
Thats great I dont pray often because Im not too religious...
Yes count your blessings because there are people who do not have it as good as you
Did you start to feel a bit lonely?
Thats tough but it helps you learn what you like to do on your own.
Stolen? Thats horrible!
I really hope so too whoever did it is an awful person.
Thats precious. How old are they?
They are really starting to grow up you better cherish them while you can.
Sorry dude thats rough. Do you know why she did that?
Women. Keep strong dude theres someone out there for you.
oh yea i know what you mean
it really does feel bad tho
Its important to spend time with your friends while you can!
Make some good memories and enjoy these next few weeks.
Great I bet he did a good job 
I know its probably because you are related 
I agree people who do animal cruelty should be in jail.
Yes we need to start teaching about this from a young age in schools.
wow really what was the result?
really that is excellent you are a genius
Oh no thats too bad it wasnt your fault at least.
Yeah just make sure that you arent in too much of a rush like that.
Thats a cool ride
That is nice. Did she like it?
Dont upset for her. May be she isnt worth for your love.
Yeah I can understand your feelings for her.
Oh really? Why do you think that is?
Aw I know that feeling since I had a big brother.
yea i know how you feel
yea i hate clowns too
Sorry to hear that. That must have been lonely.
Hopefully you can make new friends and explore new places with them!
did you return it?
did the get mad at you?
Oh my were you rushed to the hospital?
I can see why. Are you alright now?
really? what happened afterwards?
I hope you didnt hurt yourself
Me too. Its always fun during Christmas 
Dont feel bad for the opportunity that you have. Life is not set out on an even keel so we all must make the best of our lot.
Im happy that you have this opportunity in life. Keep at it and be thankful for it.
Same I can never go into public bathrooms for this exact reason. It is amazing how bad it smells in one of those!
Yeah pretty much all humans would rather smell good things than bad lol. I hope you can get over this phobia though as I know how it feels to just despise something.
that is a slap in the face.
it happens to the best of us
What job did you apply to then?
Im sure youll get the job buddy!
So exciting! What did you do with that money?
Thats good! I would have just spent it on drinks!
Really! That must have bee so frustrating for you.
jealous? Not sure why your jealous of somebody being inconsiderate.
You always hope that is the case. Sounds like it didnt turn out well. Im sorry.
Thats terrible and really not fair to you. I feel so bad you had to go through that. 
Well good luck and Im sure you will.
Your very confident. I guess thats a good attitude to have.
I wish I was more like that.
You must be prepared for anything then.
oh really? that must sting
yea i can see why you would be
You must have been disappointed. Did you ask why you didnt get it?
I would be too. But there will be plenty of other opportunities! 
Why are you nervous?
yea i agree with that
yea its not mucht ho
You must have been disappointed in that! Was it an important class?
You will you need to keep at it!
Thats so inspiring! How did he do that?
Oh wow what a claim to fame! 
I know what you mean its the excitement that keeps you up!
I would always try to sneak a peak of the gifts when my parents were not looking.
I know right. Did your Mum ask you to see if you wanted it also?
Oh no. Im sorry. Families can be tough.
That is true?
To whom did you give instructions? 
Did you feel powerful giving instructions? 
Excellent you must feel proud of him as well!
As you should be! It takes a lot of hard work.
It is nice that both of you still share good memories.
I hate it when that happens. Where you doing anything important when it happened?
Making money doing what? I hope you got it all sorted out though.
thats great you should feel proud
thats pretty sweet
Well done to you. Not everyone has that type of focus. What where you studying for?
Thats great. Did you ace the test?
have you had a lot of bad experiences?
i do agree with you there.
oh my I hope you were alright?
Im glad you are alright!
Financing can be scary but a lot of places now have really great rates for auto loans.
That sounds like a plan. It make take a while though to save that much so just be patient.
I am not a fan either
I definitely agree
Sorry for that. I hate last minute cancellations. Did he have a good reason?
Who needs friends like that. So what did you do? 
I understand. I have the feeling. Most people are now looking only for their interests.
Thats great isnt it. I hate it when managers just boss you around and never listen. 
Im happy for you that this new manager is better. It just makes working a whole lot better and more enjoyable.
I like secrets. Did it turn out the way that you hoped it would.
It was nice that you had him to turn to for help.
You must have been rather surprised. Did you thank her for it?
What a nice person. You should throw a party for her! 
What are you studying
That does sound nice
You must have worked hard for it! You deserve it then.
Good. Hopefully you continue to prepare well for the future challenges.
Sorry to hear that. That is bad. What your manager did say about it?
That is ok if they understood the situation. It will be fine.
wow what a horrible thing to walk into!
I hope it was fixed that day
Any good emotions
Those are nice feelings to have
Oh my why was she arrested?
You shouldnt feel ashamed of your moms action. It was not your fault.
Sounds like you may be choosing the same kind of person each time. There are good ones. If you give up now you may lose the chance to find the person who is right for you.
I know its hard. Just dont give up. 
I understand how you feel
I bet you will be able to mend the fences after this meeting
That is great to have fun.
That might be true
You must have thanked him for it! What was the present?
That is so helpful. I wish my brother would get me such presents.
What kind of emotions
I can understand
I miss those times too
I am confused by that as well
I would had the same reaction. Why did they fire you?
I understand. I hope you will find a better job.
I bet that was a nice feeling
I am happy for you
Was it good
sounds like a good weekend!
What could go wrong when youre taking an exam?
I understand that but I think you will be fine! We all get that fear when it comes to an important test it means were human and still feel things!
Ugh dentist visits are the worst. Atleast you can look forward to taking a break from work.
Oh yes but sometimes my boss let me off when I have to go to the dentist!
Thats quite an investment. It must have made you feel good to be buying it with your own money.
That was really nice of you. Im sure that he appreciated it.
Oh I am sorry to hear that... do you have plans on trying again?
Yes unfortunately it is... Last time I went it rained most of the day
That sounds like a great time. 
It is nice that you still have those 
are you happy about that?
that sounds good! I rather work earlier and leave earlier
So you have to do the whole process with the passport over again??
I would ask the people in charge who lost my paperwork? And tell them to go find the paperwork! 
I feel sorry for you. Did you get another job?
Good. Hope youve an wonderful career ahead!
That was nice of you
I am glad he did well
That is nice. Is she better?
Good. She will have more trust in you now.
He is smart to be that rich
thats awesomea boy or girl?
Great! I have 3 boys.  3 2 and 6 months haha
lol. Thats no problem
That is tough. That is so nice of you to be there for them
Sounds like you are a really great friend
What are you guys going to do
He sounds cool
It is always good to have things prepared in advance so you can get them done quick and easy.
I hate having to get everything ready at the last minute. It seems to hectic and chaotic when you do things that way.
I am sorry it happens though
I am sure she will forgive you
Did she give you a reason why?
Im sorry but maybe something came up for her thats a little personal?
Did he all get As?
I would be proud too. That takes a lot of effort to get straight As.
How did it go
Oh was it a nice house?
Thats good for them then.  I hope you get to buy a new home too.
Oh no! Thats not good! Whats going on?
Thats not a good environment to be in. Maybe you can find something else quickly.
Congratulations! I am sure you deserve it.
You will climb high in the company with that good attitude.
Why are you nervous?  Just try to be confident
Change your way of thinking.  Maybe you are out of her league!
I am sorry you were mad
It will get better
Did he come to pick you up?
That is great to have someone that you can trust.
Thats a good thing. A lot of people usually have to work on their weekends off instead of relaxing.
What did you do to relax during the weekend?
Oh my lord  how long to you think it had been there
Thats not good  was he all smashed up?
That sounds scary
I am glad you were okay
Hahahaha funny though. Did he have something to do with it?
Ohhhh thats not fair
What happened? did someone scare you?
That is no good But maybe he deserved it.
Are you excited for it?
Wow you are really speeding things up there arent you?
WHAT? did you have any idea beforehand  or he just showed up with your idea.
OH no! I didnt even think about that.  That must have been terrible.
Oh no  How long did he live?  is he still alive?
Thats not very long I am sorry for your loss.
Why were you late getting to work?
Your boss should really understand things like that happen and not yell at you.
Its always great to reconnect. Sounds like it was lots of fun.
You should make plans to do it again soon.
Sounds like she did well
What kind of surgery
Why you didnt go with her?
That is bad. You should had planned your vacation together.
They say for the prepared there is no such things as a surprise test.
So how did you do on the test?
Thats good to have a brother like that. Most dont seem to get along.
Thats good. Myself and my sister have gotten closer as we got older.
Taxes are always tough
I am there now
That is nice. Where are you going kayaking?
That was nice of her ha
That does sound stressful
I would have been too we get them bad here. Are you in the south? 
Same here prepping for hurricane season. Stay safe! 
Thats such a cowardly thing to do. Was there much damage?
It could have been worse. 
Me too  is there anything in particular you appreciate the most?
Thats definitely a plus for us.
Nice! Was it something you were needing?
Was it for your birthday or a random gift? Wish I could receive random gifts
Congratulations thats awesome
I do play basketball sometimes
Oh well its over now
being sick sucks they shoulda came over atleast to bring you a goody bag 
right tell them so next time they do! 
LOL.....doesnt sound storm prep to me.
It wasnt a Hurricane Party was it?
I hate spiders too
That sounds stressful
Did you get it done
Thats a good start
You were prepared for sure. Did you get the grades yet? 
thats good! im happy for you! 
That sounds wonderful!  What are your plans?
Thats great news!  You must be so happy! Congratulations!
Dont worry. Why do you think it will cost higher?
Oh hope it will be less cost. 
Thats a good choice.  What makes you want to join?
Thats as good as any reason.  When will you sign up?
We never are prepared for something like that.. how long ago was it? 
I understand! Its been about the same for me since my parents passed and it doesnt hurt any less.  Im sorry but I can tell you are strong! 
I believe that how did it happen?
That is scary it is not even your fault at all either
That is so gross. I hope you told the manager and got a refund.
Yeah I would have said the same things. Arent they supposed to wear hair nets anyway? Thatss not acceptable.
Wow that is a nice surprise! You must have done very ywell.
What kind of car did you get?
Did you call the cops on them?
That is smart I think that is the best bet
unexpected is even better than expected! congrats! 
my god i would be too pop the bubbly! 
Oh man Im so sorry for your loss. Im sure as time goes on it will become less and less.
I can only imagine.
I hate to hear that did you have many memories of playing in those woods?
Well it would have upset me as well. 
That is awesome! wow congrats to you! What kinda car? 
Really good on gas and small which is good for a first car. good for you nice of them! 
What did he lie about?
I love horse back riding.  Have you done it before or is this your first time?
My first time I sang the song from the movie Oklahoma called Oh What a Beautiful Mornin.  Im kind of dorky though.
Thats sad did they say why?
Oh Its excellent. 
Hope youll have one soon.
Sounds like you are blissfully happy. Thats a great feeling.
Dont let negativity creep in. Enjoy the moment.
What show is it?
Ah I have heard they are brutal with the killings in that show
Im so sorry! Is everything ok?
Are you sick or just not feeling well?
Really? Why did they give her a car?
Thats the worst when you do something for someone and they dont even appear to care! 
Same! Two wrongs never make a right.  You are doing the right thing. 
Thats really cool do you still keep in contact with them?
Yeah for sure i hardly speak with any of my highschool friends either.
Oh sorry to hear that.. Dont you like florida?
Thats true.. But why dont you give it a chance? may be you will end up liking it
So sorry to hear that buddy.. where were you planning to go?
Yeah i can sense how you feel.. It is ok buddy you will make it there soon enough
Oh no.. why would they do that
I understand that buddy.. Cheer up something better will come along soon enough
That is a great accomplishment!  You must be very proud!  Congratulations!
Your family is most likely just as proud!
awesome! extra money is always welcome right! Any special plans with it? 
so sweet of you and sounds like a lot of fun enjoy! 
I completely understand your point even i get emotional about my family
And we should.. family comes above all right?
Thats true.. It is challenging. how old are you?
It is natural to feel that way in early 20s trust me. you will adapt with time though 
That is not good did you complain?
How old are you now?
Hmm.. Dont worry about it. Youll get the hang of adulting soon enough.
Yeah i hear you.. I can see how that can invoke envy.. youll get there soon
You wont be i assure you. Do your part and hope for the best. 
I have seen previews for it. Looks exciting. 
You arent going to be able to sleep thinking about it.
Ughhh its so hard to keep good secrets tho honestly! 
I agree with you! What are you into watching right now?
Ive been looking forward to get some time to sit down and watch it I cant wait!
You are so right. I dont get it
ITs weird that mens bathroom are sometimes cleaner. 
What did he win?
Where they too loud?
usually people who work weekends. Its pretty rude they were so inconsiderate. 
Ill keep my fingers crossed for you! 
That sounds like a lot of fun! Did you have a good time?
Thats great to hear. The county fair is always a nice opportunity to spend time out with family.
They can be difficult.  What is the issue?
My kids eat all my snacks too.  Parent struggles are real.
Yes it was! I loved collecting the cards. They have pokemon go now 
 I liked it too it was fun to get out and get walking. 
Did you let her?
I get that swimming can be dangerous for kids
Are they older or younger?
I can understand why they mean so much to you!
I get that I guess but that is life sometimes
Thats awesome!!! you will save a lot of money for sure. 
Yup thats how it is sure a car payment is expensive but it pretty much saves you money in the long haul and looks a lot nicer! 
i know how that feels
once you get it over with you will feel better
I dont blame you. It removes your sense of security and change can always bring out fear.
One day you will be comfortable where your new home and not want to leave there either it will only take some time.
Well waters water so it should work out ok.
Oh.  Dang.  Well I guess I was wrong then P
I havent been to a fair in so long.
Thats cool. Did you meet some cool people.
Mine started last week.
I kinda miss them and our schedule gets a lot busier when schools in.
do you own a harley ?
its not literally your day off because you are here working talking to me lol
You may want to think about not letting her borrow it anymore.  Sounds pretty rude to me.
Maybe ask her to set the time when she can return it so you have a better idea when to expect it back.
What did you call for?
Im sorry about that
Whats wrong with your brakes
You can always stop at a shop and have someone check it out
Are you sure you didnt get an offer but they are running behind?
Im sorry Im sure you will find something soon.
Ouch that could be bad.  What was her reason?
Thats a tough thing to watch happen.  Just be there to support her when she needs it.
do you guys still work there ?
such an accomplishment
Well thats sweet. I bet they love you
How many  do you have?
You should take a vacation! That always helps me clear my mind.
Oh man that is rough. Im really sorry to hear that. Hang in there!
They did.  Ive struggled with trying to be more social I think it makes life more fun.
It really is.  Wonder how we can go about changing things.
Oh wow! Thats awesome. What type of car?
Oh sweet! well congrats
That can be dangerous.
I hope no one gets hurt
i could agree with this
same here but mostly at xmas time
That is awesome. What do you do?
That is great I am so happy for you
For a party?
I hate when that happens. I hope you complained and got a refund
I love DR. Pepper. Its just so hard for me to keep the weight down if I continue to drink it.
I try to keep it in moderation now but even that is hard. Its so addicting.
I remember playing that on the wii
Will it be available on xbox?
How is that feeling today?
That is okay everyone knows it is nasty anyways
time heals all pain
which is understandable
I get that he was a very funny fellow sad story
I did not really so I see how you would be more attached
What did he make you?
Well at least he tried. You have to be happy about that.
That is so true! Some woman arent loyal
Its great you trust an awesome woman
Oh! Thats great to hear. What were you fighting about?
Its normal to fight about things as a couple but I would wait a little longer before you decide to get married 
Cruises are fun. What is the problem?
Two weeks is a long time.
I wouldnt risk it
Thats pretty mean... jeez
Im gonna tell on you.
well thats not nice at all.
you can confront them about it.
No!!! I would die!!
Did you kill it??
Thats nice   I do that with pictures of my wife.
I hear you.  The best motivation is family.
I bet you were very nervous that day.
That is so true! 
Weve been together for 10 years. 
What kind of sofa is it?
That is awesome! Congratulations
That is awesome! I dont think anyone should feel ashamed of what they look like in a bathing suit. We all have imperfections!
I think we are all our own best critics and can be too hard on ourselves when it comes to appearances.
thats great to hear! I love when people help each other
oh i know. I always try to help as much as i can. i donate clothes and food
That has happened to me too. What did you do?
Aw.  A little mice wont hurt you. Its more afraid of you then you are of it.
Did it run after you?
Did you scream loudly and run?
Oh no. That had to be painful
I know how you feel. At least its not on youtube
and epically failing lol
Did she not study enough?
Thats no good. What grade is she in?
Cool. Have you found a place?
Well thats nice. IS it going well?
That really stinks! Did you complain to him? 
Wow...What a bad neighbor! Maybe insurance will cover it?
That sucks.  Do you always try specific diets or do you sometimes just try to eat less?
Thats the worst part the late night hungers.
OH thats terrible. Even worse thats in baby soap?
Well you dodged one bullet.
Thats great for them! 
Yeah that can feel disappointing and you can feel left out. Im sorry thats how it is for you. Maybe you will meet someone at their wedding?
Oh no!  That might be one of my worst fears!  Could you sleep any more after?
Ive heard of it but I cant even imagine going through it.  Im sorry it happened to you.
That sucks.  I hate when friends move away.  Are you really good friends with them?
At least shes moving for a good reason.  I had a similar thing with a childhood friend who moved for school.
That stinks  Why did you have to work late?
You should quit. Theres nothing worse than a workplace with employees who cant carry their own weight.
Im sorry youre having trouble   Is there anyone you can talk to about it?
Theres never too much   You can always find someone online or a therapist who you havent talked to before.
I hear you. Its been super hot and humid here for weeks. The only time i get out of the house is to go to the pool or get groceries lol
why not? the pool is nice and cool  i just hate staying home for a long time
Is it more of verbal arguing or flat out physical fights?
Wow. What do they usually argue about? 
my family gets into politics a lot but fortunately it rarely turns hostile.
Congratulations! Thats awesome!
I bet! I would be the same If i had a niece
Thats good stress is so common in life so its easy to become overwhelmed.
Thats an impressive philosophy you seem to have grit so I think you will go far.
Thats very nice of you. We need more compassion in the world for sure.
I understand. But my family turns a deaf ear. Im pleased that you did not.
Oh no were you happy about not having to work?
I suppose your right money matters
Aw thats nice.  Do you have a lot of good memories of high school?
My experience wasnt that great but I still had good times back then.
it happens to everyone  i stole too
its over with dont even worry about it
I was devastated as well he brought joy to all
Oh wow what was that like?
Oh how did that go? It sounds important.
Thats wonderful it must feel good to see your preparation pay off.
What sort of meat did they have?
Sounds really tasty
Oh man. Was it body odor like he hasnt showered or something on him like smoke or animal stink?
yeah I typically cant stand the smell of BO either. There really is no excuse. Just take a shower man!
Holy moly! I hate spiders...You should spray your house more just in case!
Hahaha! I would too but keep some bug spray close too!
What is the square footage?
Thats a good size good area as well?
consider yourself lucky
better that than to be drowned in studen tloan
I would be upset too! Why would they do that? did you try talking to teachers or principal?
gosh thats frustrating! Im sorry to hear that
Anyplace near you where you can get a cup?
ok that will do you I think at least for todayl.
Nice.  Ive never had luck with being unprepared for things I always choke.
Probably.  Im just bad at faking it P
That is awful! Did you break up with him?
Well I hope you can trust him again!
Aw man they are usually a lot of fun. Why are you nervous?
aww thats so sweet of your co workers! Youre definitely appreciated there
I love surprises like that! What kind of cake did they get?
How many hours a day are you training
Good For you I am really envious of people that take the time to work on their body
ewww! thats gross. I actually made a toast for my son yesterday and when i was about to give it to him i noticed a little bit of mold on the side. i almost threw up
i bet your appetite was ruined!
How do you think the interview went?
Yes that uncertainty is always tough to deal with.  But I hope you get the job!
What were some of your favorites?
I see hopefully someone can fulfill his role
like what kind
dont we all
Thats great! Have you been doing ok this year?
Thats really rough. Im sorry. I hope everything goes well for you
Aw man. Who has been working there longer you or the coworker?
Did you receive any sort of feedback as to why you might have been passed over?
Boooo! Yeah. Might be worth chatting with HR to see if there are any pointers you can get so maybe next time will go in your favor.
Oh no! Thats unfortunate...did you guys reconcile?
Thats great to have that kind of support!
I think so.  Generally getting more or less than what you deserve to get is unbalanced.
I can understand that.  Hopefully everything works out in the end though.
Im sorry! Are you going to be ok?
I bet. It stinks that that is happening to you
Yeah thats terrible. is you cat fixed?
That might be why she does it. Its something to consider.
oh no thats bad  what did you lie about?
thats not good  so i bet your wife asked you if you give him something and you said no? you should tell her
Been there myself the anticipation can really get to you.  What kind of job is it?
Finacial analyst sounds impressive.  Good luck I hope you do well and get it.
COuld you explain why?
How much was in and why not return the cards and ids?
Do you miss your grandmother?
Did you get a picture of just her or does it also have you in the picture?
Any luck yet on that?
Well I wish you luck. Maybe you need a distraction.
Could you prepare or ask for help on it?
Do your best and be confident about your work
OH NO! Is it fixable or totally destroyed?
Understandable I would be too. Did you explain to them the severity of what they did?
Oh nice Im sure that is quite a relief. Where are you going?
I hear its really nice there this time of year. I hope you have a good time!
Thats awesome. Have you been bowling for a long time?
Have you ever bowled a perfect game?
Congrats! How long have you been with your company?
Good job keep on moving up!
Maybe is time for vacations?
May a change of jobs?
Im a very apolitical person. 
not really. Im a felon. I dont get to vote. So I have no representation. That makes me a Subject of the U.S. instead of a citizen.
Thats embarassing.  What was their reaction?
Pretend with her.  Maybe its best to act like it didnt happen.
What did they do?
Did they know that the dress you were wanting?
Aw. Im sorry. Id say you have reason to be upset. I probably would be too.
What happened to you?
Did you ever move out?
Good make sure you take your time and do your best
I havent been a county fair in ages. Did you make yourself sick eating junk food?
Of course. The rides are great. Should have at least had a funnel cake.
How long has he been playing?
so along time?
Im really sorry to hear that. How long ago was that?
Oh wow. I didnt know about it. Are you doing alright?
Thats good to hear. How long have you been married?
Thats great. Do you have any children?
Oh no did you ask  the restaurant if they have video?
Thats unfortunate the bright side is that it wasnt stolen and the car is still in good working condition
That was rude. Did you confront them?
I suggest you just ask them why they didnt invite you straight up. No need to sugarcoat the main topic
Wow thats pretty early!
I bet he was. Did you record it?
awww i used to play sega with my brother  it was awesome. streets of rage was my favorite game
oh man!!! I remember contra!! Its a shooting game right? gosh we used to play this game a lot!!
Same.  Theres a lot of things I wish I could go back to for a while.
Thats the bad part about time 
Really? Maybe you should ask your boss for a raise.
Oh well thats no good.... you deserve to be paid more for your hard work.
Uau that was a close call indeed.
I not going to even try that thanks
That is interesting why do you say that?
I think a good amount of people feel the same
Yeah I know how that goes.
Yeah definitely. Im always looking for ways to make more money.
They do grow up quickly dont they! But just think of all the wonderful new things hell learn and friends hell make. Hell be able to tell you all about it when he gets home!
Thats a definite plus. Youll be able to have a little me time which is also important.
Thats great on both counts. You must be so proud of them both.
Ha! I remember when my nephew was born. I visited my sisterinlaw at the hospital. Hes 21 now!
That sounds really annoying. Have you said anything to them about it?
Oh thats not good at all. I cant believe they just let their dog do that.
That is very nice. Did you feel better after that?
That is very good and I am glad!
Oh really good for you!
I hope you do. Good luck!
Yeah I hate getting stuck in traffic.
Sometimes taking the long route will get you there faster.
what???? Thats terrible!! what a horrible person!
I bet! I mean you pay for gym membership you can stay on any equipment as long as you want!
Thats great! Congratulations. How much weight have you lost?
Thats fantastic. Keep it up
I agree. If you cant trust family then who can you trust?
Oh... well I guess you cant always trust family. But at least you can trust your wife and kids!
Dont worry too much! Im sure youll do great.
Yeah everything will work out. That kind of thing is totally normal.
Ugh that is so annoying. I try not to do that when I with my girlfriend.
have you talked to him about it? How much it bothers you.
That is awesome. Sounds like you studied hard!
Awesome great job!
Im sorry. That must make you sad.
Glad theres hope for you.
Will they be improving by alot?
Wow thats a whole bunch right there. Congrats!
Oh jeez did you ask him why he did that?
I see well kids will be kids
Whoa!  Im sorry to hear that.  Did you want to kill the guy?
Yeah I suppose I would be too.  Well if youre marriage survived I hope things are better now.
I bet that was a nice surprise!
Well Im happy for you. Spend it on something nice for yourself.
Nice! Thats an odd day to be paid but good for you!
Ooooh I love bonuses. Do you have any fun plans for it?
Did you feed it lately?
Maybe he is just missing you and wants to cuddle or something.
Losing a pet is a hard thing.  Was the cat old or sick?
Did you do anything special to honor it?
Thats no good! Did it stain your clothes?
Oh wow it sounds like you were just really unlucky that night.
That sucks did you mess up on some job activities?
Oh maybe you should tell your boss about how noone likes him?
Did you eat something?
Toss it in the fridge or freezer. Thats what I always do. Food for a rainy day D
I bet you are super excited for it. When are you going to be together 
Well good for you. I didnt even know you had internet in prison! Lucky you. lol
I pray he gets well soon. I had a similar experience so I know how it feels
Congrats.You must be very proud of her.
The talent on your family is abundant.
When will you be going?
That sounds really nice.
Was it a poisonous one?
Did everything turn out alright.
Probably for the best then.
Thats great! Congratulations and well done. He must practice long and hard to get to that stage in the game.
Then its all paid off and you should both be very proud. Perhaps hell turn pro do you think?
Aw well you cant win everything. Be happy for her!
Was there a prize you wanted from it? Or just recognition?
Thats a bummer! I hope you guys can plan something together once the deadline is over! 
I know  ...just make sure you do something fun when you have a chance! 
Did your car break down?  I always hate when unexpected things come up.
Ouch.  I bet that was uncomfortable.  
They always give a 4 hour window and either show up late or not at all
Yeah that would make me angry
Im sorry to hear that maybe youll get the next one!
Maybe it wont take too long if you work really hard and make your boss happy.
What is your favorite ice cream?
Oh that is unfortunate maybe next time
Oh no.  Did you at least get a severance? Were you able to get another job since?
Well Im sorry to hear that.  Hopefully something good is right around the corner!
Maybe find another adult with a kid for a play date
Yeah being with other adults can help
A new school year can be a pretty exciting thing.  Is it a new school year for you or your child?
Highschool was a long time ago for me but from what I remember I had great times.
I understand I think thats a good thing.
Time to get the spray out.
yeah you said that.
Oh I bet.. thats always risky honestly. Did you talk on the phone to someone while walking? 
Holy! Glad you are okay. 
Oh my gosh what did you do?
I bet glad you are ok
oh how cool! I bet you have a very beautiful voice. was there any prize?
good job! maybe you should pursue a singing career 
lol thats terrible. Did he do stuff like that a lot back then?
You should prank him to get him back.
Sounds fun.  What did you do there?
I have always enjoyed the fair.  Glad you got to go and have a good time.
I am sorry to hear that. Did the storage had insurance?
I understand.The emotional value is inrepleacable
I am glad you are please.  I am guessing you are a fan of Trump.
Well she was a bit in shock that she lost I bet.  
Yes I agree. The heat here in Texas is killing me. It was 112 last week!
Mine too love to see the leave change colors and of course be able to wear leggings and uggs!
Oh no! Was anyone badly injured?
Thats terrible. I hope your friend recovers.
What?!? That is awesome. I would be so pumped up. Were you happy for him?
Same here. Maybe he will give you some.
That was really nice of them. Sorry to hear about your mother. 
It was. Time helps.
Wow I bet that was a blast from the past.
Sounds like it! It makes me want to go find some of my old stuff.
Oh that doesnt suprise me. I voted for Hillary I knew Trump wasnt going to be worth anything. She probably wouldnt have been either though.
God for you.I am sure you are ready to ace that interview.
I am sure you will.
Do you think that we are going to have another 2008 all over again?
What do you think is going to be the cause of this one?
What kind of endeavor are you reffering to?
What about you? Dont you work?
Sounds like a good time.  What kind of truck is it?
My inlaws used to have an old chevy truck I dont remember the year though.
Oh wow you bust be lucky! I only see coins haha!
Thats amazing hope you got something yummy! 
Sounds like fun. What kind of fishing did you do? Fly fishing?
I quite fancy sea fishing  I like boats. Did you catch many fish on your trip?
Thats pretty nasty. Have you confronted her about it?
Thats really inconsiderate of her.
what?? that is so scary! Im glad you are safe. thats why i always have my gun with me
it sucks that some places dont allow conceal carry! like malls and some other places and thats exactly where those shootings happen
Thats great they were able to help you out. Are you doing better now?
I feel you. We were in a similar situation last year but things have started looking up.
It is truly horrible. Such incidents mostly happen due to drivers being careless like texting while driving. I hope no deadly casualties had been involved in this event
My condolences to the family of that passed away man. It must be truly hard for them to grasp this whole sudden devastation
Good for you!!! I think its annoying when people act like that about anything.
Yes I hope he wises up some in the future!
Did you end up getting one?
Nice where did you go?
Are you stressed out?
Try and work out or find a new hobby to take your mind off of things
Oh my what is the matter?
I am so sorry to hear that.  What is wrong with him if I may ask?
Try and give them another call to see what the situation is
Keep positive and try and get the answer you need.
Oh! What type? A fun secret or one of those sadder ones? 
Have then be able to? May I ask what the secret is? 
Reasearching papers can be tiresome.  Did it turn out well?
Then it was worth it even if it was arduous.
that is awful hopefully you can plan another one soon
im sorry thats the worst
Oh no I am so sorry. How long do you have to wait to take it again?
I remember struggling with that too when I did my test. I was so nervous. 
Uh oh thats bad. Did you have insurance for it?
Oh no! I hope youre able to get it fixed for cheap!
I love vacation time.  Where are you planning on going?
Sounds exciting.  Ive never been there.
maybe just take it slow
maybe that was the case
What subject is it in?
Do you anticipate a problem?
That is great for you!
It is lovely to have a friend like that.
That great news.  I dont know how rare it is but in the 14 years Ive been married weve seen a lot of other couples suffer with infidelity.
I find faithfulness requires love and effort.  Both together are necessary.
Agreed its a choice made every day.
I love to hear that positive stuff! Im glad for you. 
I love when good things happen especially since they usually dont happen often. 
What do you mean? 
Im sorry to hear that. I think everyone feels that way to a certain degree even if it is more for some and less for others.
I understand that can be hard to deal with! Have you tried anything new regarding what it is that you are self conscious about?
Yuck that would be bad.
No need to look closer at some things.
Are you planning to keep it?
Thats fitting at least.
I understand maybe things will improve for you!
Oh no! Are you alright?
I cant either. Hopefully they dont actually cause someone else to wreck.
Have you tried seeking expert help?
hahahahah so you are more worried about your friend than actually fixing the boat?
Oh my goodness thats crazy! Do you have home insurance to cover the cost to replace everything?
Yeah thats awful Im sorry that happened to you. Im glad youre alright at least! Thats a scary thing to happen.
Oh gosh! Are you alright? 
Oh man! Im so sorry to hear that. 
dont be nervous your instructors will not put you in danger
i cant argue with that lol
I didnt know the exact timing like that but its believable and I know its harder for the body to use the energy when you eat late.
Exactly and since they dont burn the body turns it into fat to burn later or something like that I think.
Oh that sounds like a good deal! It wouldnt get her in trouble or anything right?
Oh okay. Thats up to you! I just wouldnt want my friend to get in trouble!
Oh yeah? When is your friend arriving?
Why are they so sad?
Hmm yeah that is a pretty sad thing. Hopefully you can cheer them up a little.
Did you study?
That is great. Im glad for you!
Well cool!  Were you nervous at all going into it?
So are you going to be going on a roller coaster at a fair for a second time?
Why is it so annoying? Is your friend messaging you all the time or something?
Oh well thats not good. Do you actually owe them?
Nice! Where will you be going?
Well I really hope you two have a great time!
Dont beat yourself up about it. I did the same with my mother all the time when I was in my early teens. Weve all been there.
Oh I agree I still feel awful about it myself! But I think our parents understand and dont take it to heart because they usually did the same thing too 
It is a gorgeous day where I live too! Im sorry you dont have anyone to share it with!  Do you have plans later?
Ill be relaxing in my pool later!  You shouldnt let a day go wasted just because you dont have anyone to hang with!
Oh no!  I am sorry to hear that.  Was he suspended?
that is incredible i bet you are really proud
i remember when my daughter did her first steps i was so proud of her
Probably not.  But now Im interested to know.  What happened?
I can believe it.  It does tend to happen.
Oh god! Did everything turn out well?
I would have been SO scared! Im glad it all turned out fine though! 
What made you feel strange?
I am sorry we all have our moments of wanting to go back in time I know I do.
Oh no! I am sorry to hear that what is going on?
That would make anyone upset! I am sorry!
Thats good youre getting a break! Life is much more rough as an adult than I thought it would be as a kid.
No kidding! Im glad things are good for you now  rest relax and enjoy!
Money is always amazing! Good for you. 
Go for the dark chocolate its more expensive but its worth it! 
Are you sad and all alone now?
Maybe you can find a new friend!
Oh what a worry that must have been. Did you have to evacuate?
That must have been awful! Friends in Florida had to evacuate. When they got home their house had feet of mud in it. Did you have much damage to your property?
Oh how fun!!! I bet you had a great time!!! I LOVE county fairs!
That sounds amazing!! I love the old fashioned theme. What was your favorite thing at the fair?
Did they have a live band or was it more of a DJ type thing?
sounds super gross! i bet you were a mess. 
Thats how it usually is then boom fly guts all over your helmet and clothes. 
Where do you like to get your purses?
You sound like a smart and informed shopper.
You can use the left over money on so many other things!
Cool! That sounds like a lot of fun! I bet it will be a blast for you.
Its always great when you can afford to get what you like. Good for you! Im sure you deserve it!
How far away is she ?
Well that was nice .
That is a good feeling. What has changed?
That is so awesome! Congrats!
How old was your doggy?
Did she have a disease?
Oh yeah what kind of boat?
Sounds super cool im happy for you 
Oh no! I am so sorry!! I hate when something liek that happens. No one was injured?
Well I am glad no one was injured!!! Its a shame to lose great kitchenware though!! I hope you will be able to find a suitable replacement!
Oh my gosh. You must have been horrified. I cant even imagine.
Thank goodness you are ok though. That could have been really really bad.
Thats good news.  Did they have a good track record for sales in past jobs?
Hope it all works out for you.  Selling cars can also be a stresfull job.
What!! Thats awful oh my my goodness thats really pathetic 
Exactly how can you go there not being able to trust your coworkers 
NOOOO! Ive been there and I feel your pain! What kind were you trying to get?
That sounds delicious and Im going to have to try that! My personal favorite is Ben  Jerrys Phish Food. Now I want some.
Oh really? What happened to you?
Wow thats pretty scary! Glad there was a good Samaritan around to warn you!
Oh my thats a big problem. What did you do?
Thats good! But also was wondering what is a livid?
Well good for you.  What did you do to prepare yourself?
Well good.  Did you get the job?!
Thats awesome news congrats! 
even better honestly then you didnt have to deal with the stress of trying and it just came natural! 
Is it the first day of school for them?
Summer breaks seem to be getting shorter each year.  Hope they had a good day as well.
Okay but probably not a good idea in the long run.
Hopefully youve got a new friend.
Sounds like a fun time! What did you guys do? 
glad you guys got to spend some fun fam time together 
I would be so excited! 
Hopefully everything goes really well for you and happy birthday! 
Wait what?! Thats unbelievable! Why?
Riiiight...thats a stupid lie if Ive ever heard one. Fight this if you can! After 10 years they should be promoting you if anything.
That was smart to get a used one. I hope you got a good deal on it.
I think most of the time when people sell childrens items youre pretty safe. And you can google to make sure of it too.
Thats freakin awesome! I never win anything go you! What band is it?
I love them!!! So jealous hope you have a blast!
Aww Im sorry to hear that. Maybe you can find a new hobby for the weekends.
I definitely understand. It really sucks that youre so limited. 
Im so sorry to hear that. What is wrong with him?
That sounds oddly crazy and wild. Reminds me of rabies? I hope you make his last days his best and glad he wont be suffering anymore.
That is wonderful!  They must be so happy and relieved also to not have to pay!  
Oh good. I was going to ask how you felt about it.  Are you in college?
thats awesome good for you
well that is great very hard thing to accomplish
Strange place for something to surprise you. What happened?
Eek Im with Indiana Jones on this one. I hate snakes. Hope you werent bit!
oh wow i hate when people record those type of videos. Its really not funny to me and very inconsiderate of that person! How embrassing!
hahaha pay back is the sweetest revenge sometimes 
That is crazy! That must seem to fly by.
Yeah that must be very strange. I do not have any children but I can imagine how crazy that is to watch them grow up!
Wow I didnt know that! Did you have a good time?
Thats wonderful! I am so glad that you had a good time. Maybe I will visit there one day.
Im sorry to hear that I hope your luck changes up soon!
Wow that sounds really fun! Ive never been on a cruise! How long will it be for?
Neither have I and thats on my bucket list! So jealous! I hope you have an awesome time!
Well thats exciting! A fresh start is always fun. What inspired you to make such a big change?
Awesome youll be able to make friends at work. I wish you the best in your new city congrats!
Aw man kids can be SO lazy and dont like to do what theyre supposed to. Have you tried a rewards system to get them to do what they have to or are they too old for that?
YES. I say make them do it. Maybe take away phones etc. if they dont get it together. No excuses for that!
Oh no how terrible. Was anyone hurt?
I bet I would be too. Did you stop and talk to the police?
Aww that must be kinda hard on you.
Ive definitely been there my husband is in the military so hes away often. I find its helpful to stay busy trying new hobbies help!
Oh no. Im sorry to hear you are going through a rough patch.
That really does help. I hope you make it through!
I am so sorry to hear that! Have you already filed for unemployment?
If you do a Google search for your state  unemployment you should be able to find resources and might be able to file online. Im sorry again thats tough.
thats a big accomplishment
yea thats fair
Oh no is your cat okay?
I can understand that anytime I smell or see vomit I want to vomit too.
Eew! My neighbors cat used to puke on my bed  coughing up a furball.
Not surprised  Ive felt like that too. Did you manage to get it cleaned up ok?
That sounds so awesome! And fun!
Did you ask her to kindly stop? 
She may not be the best choice of a friend if she likes annoying you so much.  Maybe try distancing yourself from her for a while.
Oh cool!  What would that be?
Aw Im sorry.  Im sure youll get something you want eventually though!
Thats good. As long as at gets you where you need to go. Thats what matters.
lol that is impressive
lol I bet
did you retaliate?
Haha!  Thats hilarious from my perspective but must have been embarrassing for you!  What did you do?
I happens to all of us at least once in our lives!
Oh wow!  I remember the commercials too!  He looked like the coolest toy out there!  Did your daughter like it?
I guess its true everything comes back around in style and toys and things.  That would make a fun Christmas gift! Then you could play with it too! ha ha
Bet youre tired. Whats the speech forabout?
Ah okay doesnt sound fun. Hope you did well and everything went smoothly!
That sounds like a lot of fun! Have you been practicing for a long time? Im too much of a klutz to be able to do that so I respect you for it.
Thats really cool. Hope you have a lot of fun!
Thats a real bummer. I bet you were pretty ticked off.
Yeah Ive had that happen to me before. Some bags are cheap and fall apart.
Scary!!! What was it?  Were you terrified or just curious?
I would be too!  Did you try to see if you could see someone from another window or just run back to bed?  Im glad youre ok!
There are a lot of people allergic to shellfish. Thats a bummer though lobster is good.
Oh no that is terrible. How did you find out it had lobster in it?
Thats awesome animals are the best! What kind and is it a boy or girl?
Aw thats a great friend right there. Congrats on your new puppy!
thats a bummer! do you not have a case on it?
thats good make sure to get a case too!
How do you mean? I guess it depends on the lady does it not?
Oh I am so sorry  that is an awful thing to happen. But please dont think all women are like that many are loving and loyal.
I am very sorry! That is very frustrating! Can you speak with a supervisor about the situation?
I dont blame you I would talk to him. Even if he is uninvolved it is not fair for you to bear the full weight of the tasks at hand. I sure hope he has a solution and the work load eases!
Oh I bet that did irritate you! Its bad enough moving but you dont need your furniture falling apart on you.
Yes and possible it just had too much stuff on it. But youre right sometimes its cheap wood they use.
were you scared?
I would be scared too.  It is cool that you were brave enough to try though.
Oh no thats always really stressful. Just do your best to prepare and try not to worry about it. Whatever happens happens and if youre less stressed youll probably do better.
No problem and Ill send good vibes your way that you pass! Good luck youve got this.
ohh gosh. What happened?
ohh thats bad. You seem struggling to provide food for your kids. I will pray for you and wish you a good luck in future. But dont shoplift again otherwise you will get into trouble
That was so nice. What kind?
Carrot cake is wonderful!
Thats awesome I hope you win! What are you playing?
I bet you will do great!! It sounds like you have been practicing very hard and you have the desire. That is a winning combination!!
That sounds like a nice memory but we all grow old. Do you still spend time with them sometimes?
Yeah I agree. I have a little one myself and I kind of with they stay that young forever.
That sounds very exciting. I am sure you will have a great time.
Those sound like fun activities. I hope you take lots of pictures so you can remember the trip.
That sounds fun. Was it a scary movie?
Oh okay. Did you watch it all alone?
What made you suspect that it might rain?
Its good that you thought ahead.
I hate to hear that! I hope everything goes well and you get better news than you are expecting.
I always try to do things to avoid thinking about things like that maybe you could do the same!
That sounds fun! But what is cornhole? Ive never heard of it before!
Okay interesting. Id like to try is some time!
Oh man!  That is my nightmare!  You must have been so worried!  Are you OK?
I would imagine!  That is great news!  I am sure you had a nice sigh of relief!
Ugh that is so annoying! Have you confronted him about it yet? 
Wow what a jerk...sorry you have to deal with that. I hope you can resolve that situation somehow.
you should take the docs advise and get your health under control though its important!
good i hope you do well and stick to it!
I would be so embarrassed. I would have probably done the same thing but I would feel so guilty.
Yeah thats what I would probably do also. It probably wont even be that big a deal in the end.
That is great!  What a nice parent!  You must be pumped!  You should do something nice for her to show your appreciation!
That is a great idea!  Cruises are amazing.  You all will have a great time!
Im so sorry.  What kind of t
Oh wow.  I bet that was really hard.  Hopefully next time you will win
thats awesome! what was the charity?
That is kind when i have the means i try to donate
ohh thats great! Now hes ready to learn life lessons. ha ha!
Ha ha! Dont be annoyed thats what children do! believe me!
That is a wonderful attitude to have!  Being content and happy with your life is so important!
Most people always complain about what they dont have and never stop to appreciate what they do have.
That sounds like a lot of fun. I have always wanted to go to one of those shows.
I like how colorful the whole production is. It really does look amazing.
ohh thats bad. What happened?
I feel you. That happens with me every time.
Oh my what happened to cause this?
sheesh im sorry about that sharting is the worst
Omg congrats D
Yeah at first it might feel a little lonely but itll be nice to have some relaxation time right? 
That would be nice. We need some rain too. 
Thanks! Enjoy your rain!
that terrifying i am scared to death of hurricanes
that is understandable! were you effected by harvey?
Thats a real bummer. I am sure they benefited from your coaching even if they didnt win in the playoffs.
It must be satisfying to see the improvements of your pitchers. You are really helping their careers.
Cats eat everything they are not humans
The buy yourself the food
Oh well you cant go back and change it now
Im just saying dont feel bad I highly doubt your one vote would have been a tie breaker anyhow.
That is good what do you find good about the economy?
Do you think the unemployment rate is going down? 
im sorry about that! Did your son start school already?
Thats great. Thats good to hear
That is nice to hear. I hope they really like each other.
Yeah well you will find someone one day. Just be patient!
Ohh! thats so awkward! What happened then?
Yes! Maybe you should set a reminder next time! ha ha!
Im sure its hard waiting for the new releases when its a game your hyped up for! I enjoy playing games too!
I enjoy RPG games the best. So I really liked Fable Halo Sims Assassins Creed etc.
That is so true. I agree with you
Yeah people tend to have some harsh reviews on things and that could be troubling
whoa yeah thats awful i wouldnt either
i agree 100 you make a commitment  should stick too it
I stop playing videogames years ago
I prefer to read books on my free time because I am grown up
Well he is probably lying.
Elvis only had a daugther so the chances of him telling the true are slim
The economy is cyclical so it is bound to happen eventually.
Well the last time the economy was bad we had a different president. It is hard to say why recessions happen.
That is very true! They are very good
I am! They are my favorite team!
I am sorry to hear that! I hope your dog gets better
Thats good! I will be praying for you and him
Agree 100 it makes me want to adopt all the pets! Have you ever rescued an animal?
Thats amazing. I have a rescue myself and I will never have a pet any other way.
Yes they are. I live in Oklahoma and we deal with them all the time. I have seen some really bad ones.
One year we had one hit a school in Moore and a few children died. It was so devastating. I hate tornados so much.
That is very impressive! my brother in law is starting his senior year as well
Certainly does she have a college in mind?
Ha youll have to enlighten me as I dont know much about the Chargers. Are they usually not a good team or what?
Thats unfortunate. How do things look for this upcoming season?
Thats wonderful! Congrats
Well that is wonderful! I would be proud as well
Thats awesome. Was this the first year this particular team was together?
Gotcha. Why low expectations did you not do well last year?
That is awesome. I bet you really helped him develop his talent.
You have made a big difference. Glad you are making a difference.
thats a horrible feeling especially something sentimental 
i hope like crazy you find it!!
lol thats tough to deal with have you asked if she has any friends?
ah dang dude thats kind of cold hearted
I understand that. I bet you miss them a lot.
Yeah it is rough at that age to be apart. At least you can Skype and keep in touch.
that is rude of them they should at least wave a thank you or something
Yeah i always to make sure to thank the people that do ncie things for me
Im sorry I dont know who that is. Was he famous?
Oh. Sounds like a big loss for Blackhawks fans that sucks.
That is a huge moment in a kids life! I would be too congratulations 
I do not at the moment but I plan to at least when I turn 35 years old
oh man thats terrible thats a horrible feeling! 
At least everyone was still at work and you werent left there alone!
that is awesome i bet it took a lot of hard work to accomplish
Yeah i remember a long time friend went there and it was such a pain to be able to get accepted
Thats awesome! What sport is the team for?
Wow congratulations! That is a pretty competitive league as well
i am too i think we are headed in a better direction!
i hope so we are def the greatest nation in the world
Congratulations always nice to have a new addition to the family!
That is always the biggest worry when having kids and Im happy it worked out for you guys.
a great family makes all the difference and can get you through anything
i am also grateful to have a caring family that means the world to me
That is so great that youre cooking for her!  Did she love it?
Oh good!  You must be so proud too!  I love watching youtube recipes!  Im so glad it turned out for you!
You must be the luckiest girl on earth
That sounds like a lot of fun! Is it hard to ride a mule? Ive always heard they are stubborn.
Huh well I will definitely have to try that some time. Ive always wanted to ride a mule!
Thats neat whats the tournament for?
I love cornhole! I used to play that all the time when I tailgated in college. Good luck!
i didnt either! i though germany would repeat
the final match was really entertaining too the whole cup was good!
Why would they take it off air? it was a great show
that is not cool do you think it will ever come back?
Oh no. That really stinks! I know how that feels. We like the Red Sox here.
They are having a good season but have had many bad ones. Boo Yankees!
That is so exciting! I bet you cant wait to spend time with her!
I know I feel the same way when my wife is gone. 
Nice!  Nothing better than driving a smooth new car!  What kind did you get?
Noice! Ha ha thats so funny.  I have a 1999 Jeep Grand Cherokee.....I bet its like night and day! Take that baby out and ride it with the windows down and the music up!
That is exciting! I hope everything goes well.
I have two boys myself! I feel like two kids is the perfect amount. Not too much to drive you insane and just enough so your first isnt lonely.
Wow how nice. Is she always doing nice things?
Wow you are lucky to have someone like that in your life. Thats rare.
that is awesome i am really proud college is really important for your future
im sure you will find something you like eventually
lol some free time! what grades?
thats awesome! i hope they have a great year
im sure! its tough being at home all day without alot of interaction
Yes they are. Its a shame how dry it is.
Yes that is what its like in my area too.
I have heard about that game. Is it a role playing game?
Oh cool. I should check it out. I like those kinds of game.
oh my goodness i would freak if my dog ran out he is like another child of ours
that is great its nice to have someone that is so helpful around 
That is crazy does your boss not care?
You could just start going in late everyday as well to make a point to her.
i wish i could stay up late and just watch tv alone some times. i dont have any alone time.
I love winter and wearing sweaters and jeans. This summer heat is too much!
I live in the south but Im from the north and thats one think I miss is the cooler weather. I definitely dread the summer as well.
You are more trusting then I am. I dont even trust my wife in my car.
Thats very nice of you. Maybe I can learn from you and be more trusting.
that is not good did you manage to get it done somewhere eles?
that is not good i really hope you can get it done on friday
Oh the new one comes out on Friday? I used to play it back in college a bit with my roommates.
Wow you are a dedicated player. Id imagine you will do awesome online then.
great health and being well off is a blessing i too am grateful for tha
i agree! its refreshing to hear someone with a good outlook on life
i live in a small town too. i grew up in a big city so the change is very welcome
small town country life is much more my speed
I can relate to that the late night anxiety of the unknown. Hate that.
It always seems to wait til your head hits the pillow then BAM!
oh no. is she alright?
so she probably had scar tissue. i hope this one goes better for her.
i imagine so especially when you have no idea what to expect
lol what country are you in?
Oh man did you put your socks on after you put your boots on? That must of been awkward getting your socks dirty. 
For sure that is a motto to live by! I wouldnt dream of doing anything different. 
I can relate. I wish I still enjoyed them as much as I did way back then. Now Im either out of place of its a ghost town.
I live in a very large city on the east coast. We have one mall here called The King of Prussia Mall. Its the 2nd largest in the USA. Any time you go its packed but if you drive 15 minutes to any of the other malls around it they are sad. Half the stores closed and no people.
Heck yeah! I myself have never been into madden more of a NBA2k guy.
Ive been playing it since I was a kid but I always wait like 3 years in between buying them.
that is a great feeling what are you pusuing?
man thats awesome i have a friend who is in that field and its very interesting
i understand that for sure finishing a task is a great feeling
congrats! was it for college?
Yes I love them they deserve to win
But dont forget that the yankees are super good 
oh no! we went through the same thing last december
i know thats right i dont know how they survived without electric
Congratulations looks like you guys will be saving a lot of money from no more diapers.
Haha you cant always be 100 accurate when you first pursue a goal!
i know the feeling it makes you wish time would slow down
thats right going through the same feeling with my son
I dont have any kids but I can only imagine.  It even seems like Im growing old fast.
Did it scare you or did you make a new friend? It happened to me a few years ago and it turns out the dog just needed a friend. 
Go over when your neighbor is home and make friends with the dog. Take him a ball or a treat. If it happen again you know your safe.
thats great! what a good husband
I dont mind laundry as long as i dont have to cook!
thats great. it stinkswhen you have to worry about customer service giving you a hard time
exactly. some companies really try to go above and beyond
It must feel lonely for sure but maybe they cope with it in different ways.
Yeah it is quite sad knowing there are some people who have literally no one.
why is that buddy
Im glad she changed. At least now you guys can save money on food because its cheaper to cook 
Oh ok. Well thats awesome. What did you guys do?
What country are you living in?
How interesting. Do you move for your job?
Oh thats a great habit to have. Did you go to the gym?
Wow thats a great accomplishment! I need to get back to the gym too.
I dont think I have ever remembered a single friends birthday until facebook was created.
That is true were they upset?
Probably you just have to remember next year! 
You are very trusting. Id just assume give my kidney to someone as 10k.
Your better then I am. I hope you dont learn a lesson the expensive way. 
Who is carrying them out?
Sounds horrible do you think theyll get caught?
Thats cool. I bet it brought back memories of your mom in the kitchen using it!
Im guessing she was either busy or didnt like to cook? I can relate!
sorry i accidentally sent that first message early.  that is great that she is going back to school.  I bet you are so proud of her
Yeah that is pretty tough. Especially when you really like to work together.
Then you have to meet their replacement and try to get to know them better. It usually isnt the same.
You must be a good cookie chef! Dont feel too bad they should have been quicker!
Oh youre sly! Call the cookie addiction hotline quick!
always great to see people youve been away from happy early birthday!
lol no doubt! i got to see a bunch of friends recently at a wedding it was nice
For vacation? And yeah the rates are pretty high hopefully you wont be in those areas.
Thats awesome I bet itll be in a nice secluded resort!
i grew up in miami so i know how you feel
i know what you mean. i lived thru hurricane andrew and it was traumatizing
Im sorry to hear that. Is it drugs or alcohol?
Oh my! I thought the wrong thing. Im so sorry to hear that I hope he is okay!
What did you drink specifically? 
Did you eat anything?
I agree. I wish all the countries would get along. No need to be mean to each other.
Also I think all the countries should allow foreigners to visit. I dont understand why they are so territorial.
that is intense! what was it?
ahh dang thats terrible! that is pretty bad luck
Did she take care of a bunch of dying kids?
That is good it is nice to have a woman like that
What school did you go to?
Wow!  Im from that area and love the Buckeyes too!
Why not?  How can you not be happy with a 6pack?
Thats insane I hope you plan on returning that ASAP!
thats insane!! were you able to get in? and what concert?
shoot thats a bummer! hopefully they will make it up to you
Seriously.  I was looking it up the other day thinking about moving somewhere else and that state was even worse.  Then to read about everything that makes the crime rate is overwhelmingly scary.
I know it really makes you leery of everyone around you.  There are still some good people in the world though.  Im one of them! 
Wow that is very far away. Do you get to visit often?
Yeah that is a bummer. Maybe one day you will live closer together.
that happened to me once i almost died. my heart was racing and then boom out pops my cat.
but what if its just some air or something
What was the subject?
Id imagine its tough
That is good that you have something to protect yourself with
i completly agree specially with the crazy people there is these days
Did they choose to switch themselves or was it out of their control?
Well maybe you guys can hang out outside of work?
Thats great!  Sounds like hes a smart kid!
Thats awesome just keep him on the right path and hell be the next Elon Musk!
That would be good. There is so much vitriol happening in society these days.
I wish people would just get along. Stop fighting each other.
It is really eating me up inside. I will make sure to pay it back with my next paycheck.
who got in?
you mean the men of the underworld?
Ok who is competing you?
Nice will check it up i love indoor athletics as well
Aw Im sorry why cant you?
Im with you on that one especially if it requires flying. No way can I afford that.
i grew up with hurricanes and those are terrifying i can imagine tornados
exactly. are you in the usa?
Wow the trifecta! Congratulations on that!
Right I think you are in for a rowdy time for sure!
I never liked those either.  Do you have any health problems that would make you dread it?  
Dont sweat it.  Youll do great.  Its never a fun process but thats so good youre keeping up with your health!
Do you at least get to ride in it with him?
Yeah its always better to get motivated rather than jealous! Use it as motivation to save more money.
That is awesome. Its nice how social media can reconnect people.
I think it has its purpose. It makes it easier to find people you lost touch with.
Oh trust me theres nothing to be jealous about! The heat is KILLER where I live.
I live in central Louisiana in the US. Our winters never really get THAT cold. Id say coldest is 25 degrees Fahrenheit.
Thats always scary the plane starts shaking and you immediately think Were going down!
I bet your anxiety was through the roof Ive flown a lot and still that freaks me out.
Do you not see them much?
I can relate. I last seen my mom around 8 years ago and my dad around 10 years ago. Maybe you should move closer to them.
oh no. that is horrible
oh goodness i know right
Thats awesome what did you do to take advantage of it?
Thats great nothing beats the farmers market.
Wow that is interesting. Did you win the case?
Great job! I would have laughed as well. Great technique to prove your point it is always good when you can get emotion from the judge 
Oh no Im so sorry to hear about this may his soul rest in peace
May his soul rest in peace and his memories live on
Well it was there for you. If someone else wanted it they would have been there first!
You are very thoughtful. I am sure he understands a chocolate craving is never to be denied!
That is wonderful!  That is a difficult instrument to master.  Was he nervous beforehand?
What a wonderful moment!  Does he want to try to take it professional and be in an orchestra or does he not know yet?
oh no. is everything ok?
i would get someone to look at it if possible to avoid any disasters
Sounds like a productive evening! What did you cook?
sounds more healthy than the chicfila that I had!
i do too flying is kinda nervewracking 
oh yes definitely
That is amazing! I bet youre excited
That stinks but I guess the law is the law. Are you going to fight it?
I know how that feels but I guess they have to pick someone and it was just your bad luck day. It can always be worse.
What kind of practice is it? That takes a lot of guts!
Not literally of course lol. Good for her I am sure she will do fine!
Does it make you feel good to at least think about those times though?
Yeah life comes at you fast.
oh my god im so sorry. ive only got one grandparent left and its tough to even imagine not having her
i do. im so sorry you are having such a hard time. may you find peace in her memories.
That is always a wonderful feeling to be prepared and ready to go.  Are you a morning person?
I can understand that.  Such a great idea before the chaos of it all.  Its important to do things like that your ourselves!
You shouldnt be jealous. There is no need for that
Well that is ridiculous. Im sorry
Did you have to take a test?
Thats good. If its like mineyou had to wait forever!
Why did that happen
That does suck
Thats nice. Is he enjoying retirement
Thats great. I hope to retire some day.
Do you feel like that helps or hinders your personal life?
I can relate I like to keep work at work but as an adult you spend so much time at work its hard to meet people other places.
How beautiful! They are so much bigger when I see them than I think they are going to be.  My parents house has some land and when I bring my kids over there we can see the young bucks eating the grass in their backyard.  
Yes!  Theyre legs are so much longer than I thought and they hope over theyre 8 foot tall privacy fence like its nothing!
that is amazing. children can amazing you if you give them the opportunity
its crazy the things they are learning now. it makes you feel like a dummy 
Are there any other types of seafood you like?
That is very sad
I am sure he did
Get ready to wait for a long time. DMVs are terrible.
Some allow you to make an appointment. You should try that.
Well thats fun! I bet you are really excited about it.
Oh front row tickets make it even better! Have a great time.
Oh no I think I know where this is going. How did she manage as a waitress?
Haha oh boy! Well on the bright side Im sure thats a mistake shell only make once. We all have to learn.
One of the many reasons Im glad to have hardwood!
How have they changed the most? 
What do they do now? 
Did you end up washing dishes.
Was he upset about it?
oh i thought he wanted a baby.. dump him first
Actually my aunt is afraid of them also. She said as a girl one cornered her and wanted to hurt her. Why are you scared of them? 
Strange. Next time you have them try them cooked in goose liver fat and scotch. AMAZING!
Im sorry about that. Dont be nervous though. He is a loyal person I bet
What is the name of the company?
Were you worried at all about the cost of raising them?
Yeah Id imagine
Nice what team is that you are rooting for?
No I really dont follow sports much.
oh wow thats great.  
I have never been camping.
Thats really nice we dont get a lot of that these days. Makes me kind of miss the old days when people had a real sense of community.
I totally know what you mean. I live in a smaller city now and it feels a lot cozier than larger cities Ive lived in before.
Why is it torture? 
Yeah maybe next time
That must be pretty lonely. Do you talk often?
Well that should help
Well eep it up and visit when you can
haha oh no.
i bet he appreciated that at least
at least it didnt turn into one of those cheesy 80s movies
What kkind did you get?
I have always had hp. I do have an ipad though
Wow thats great! How old is he?
Thats wonderful to see that kind of progress. You must be very proud.
Thats nice of you. Is it a small dog or large?
Did it make you want one of your own?
Why what is happening on Monday?
Those are always stressful better study hard!
That is good are you married?
Do you want to have kids in the future?
Thats a bummer at least it didnt go out in the beginning of summer I guess.
Dads are always life savers.  I love my Dad as well he has saved me in a couple of occasions.
Yeah it sucks when people just seem to have it all.
Are you the type thats prone to getting sick?
Well thats too bad.  Yeah when you have bad genetics there arent enough apples to keep the doctor away.
was there a reason why?
maybe it was closed event. you speak to her about it?
OH no! Were they okay?
I bet you were relieved.
Oh no thats horrible. Any idea why?
Thats so strange. Id give the power company a call and see if there wasnt a mistake.
You should find the local cafe or something
You can always google the local hot spots. Youve got to get out there. It might not be easy
i used to get screwballs with my sister. those were our favorites  as kids
how awesome. its fun to remember the good old days
i love sharing memories with my sister
I havent had pizza ht in forever. They dont deliver in my area
Did you complain?
Well that sucks
what is with the book you are writing? people dont chat like that. yea christmas list
its all good. you are able to write very well. im jealous
probably yeah. good luck
I am sure you will do just fine!
Absolutely and if you can start with a game for them too that would help.
Sorry to hear about that. Is it still working alright or under warranty?
That stinks. Phones are so important these days. People always give others crap about staring at them all day but its because they afford us the ability to do so many things. I hope youre able to get another one soon.
Do you feel better now?
Thats good Its sucks when you have to take care of yourself when you dont feel well.
I am too
I understand that as well
I can understand that. Everything is right at your doorsteps. 
That can be very rough. Maybe you can move there soon!
That sounds terrible
They are so rude
did you take him to the vet?
oh thats good then.
Little kids are pretty amazing how they can pick things like that up in the right environment. So nice you are teaching him good manners those are in short supply in adults these days!
Poor little guy. Sounds like hes lucky to have you especially at such a critical time in his life.
What is it for?
Thats pretty cool. I am a Pharmacy Tech
That is so true. That certification was really easy. I was nervous for no reason
You will do great!
THAT must have been a nightmare. How many do you have?
That can be rough. I know Ive dealt with that with my kids by giving them each 10 minutes of solo time before they go to bed. Allows them to get their energy out.
It should work! Let them pick what you do for the 10 minutes then move to the other one. Ive done puzzles read books and solve Rubix cubes with mine. Good luck!
where is he going and for how long?
oh i hope he is safe. i hear there is a lot popping off there right now!
Wow thats huge! I wonder if he got sick afterward?
I bet he did lol! I would have too if I ate that much!
I am sure you are it is nice
That is a great feeling
That is great. When did you take the test?
Was it hard or an easy test?
Congratulations! What are you studying?
Wow that subject was always tough for me in school. Good for you!
Was this at home or at work?
Really? Congratulations! I hope you guys are really happy!
Thats always awesome when the kids approve of him! Im really happy for you guys and wish you the best!
What is happening this weekend?
Sounds fun where at?
those sound like good people to have around
Oh that is a pickle. Congrats on the new love. Why might your parent not approve?
Ah they had certain expectations I see. Well you cant help who you fall in love with. Hopefully they will support you in the future.
Thats great I hope he enjoy hisher stay
How long is he staying?
Did you teach him?
Sounds like hes a natural
Something yummy Im sure. Are you nervous? 
Perhaps some Vino with it?
Yikes Im not sure that will match well with Chicken Parm.
Yeah I know how that feels. I think it is part of growing up.
Kids have aversions to clean rooms. She is not the only one who does that.
I believe in that too. 
Well it think there is a time frame on the bad luck though
OH wow! Congratulations. First one?
Oh no what for?
Im sorry I hope everything goes okay!
I can imagine! What did you have on the pizza? 
Carbs are great when you havent had them in a while. You deserved to splurge!
I hear you! Have you tried spraying lemon etc on yourself or eating them? Helps me a lot!
Yes it is usually if you h ave acidic blood I think too much sugar? Try onions garlic and lemons generally stops them from biting me. I HATE misquitos.
that doesnt sound good.
Good were you always late?
You meant on time for home. That is good.
I can understand the feeling. What job did he get?
Oh wow does he make a lot of money?
I think the right amount of spanking is OK.  I was spanked as a child and know I deserved it.  Hopefully you didnt take it to far though!
Dont beat yourself up too much.  Spare the rod spoil the child.  Your guilt seems to be from what other people might think.  You know if it was necessary or not.
I still have yet to see it. I hate how hype affects things. I wish you could always get to things before they become really pumped up.I bet if you watch again sometime later youll find it a little better.
I never get too wild into the Marvel movies. Seems like you always know how its going to end. To me theyre good not great. And they can get repetitive.
I get it I think Id like to go back and relive the big events. I miss those the most football games and dances.
Yeah there wasnt much to worry about except classes and whatever drama was going around at the time!
My girlfriend always likes to wait until the needle is past empty. I never let it get past halfway empty. I dont get how she deals with that stress in her life! And to me it makes no sense. But I guess she hates spending the money on it so she waits.
One time she actually forgot to turn the car off while pumping gas. She just stuck the thing in and went inside the shop. I was in the passenger seat... I stopped looked for a second and thought Wait can you do that now...?
Well thats nice of you to do that for them. I bet they enjoy the treat.
Maybe you could try putting it on a cute bird feeder so itll be a little easier for them?
They mightve taken out a loan they cant afford.
At least its paid of and you dont have to worry about payments on it.
Whats that? Drink?
Bad or Genius? 
Oh that sounds awful. I am sorry you had to see that.
Thats good that you can see a positive in that. You must be a very strong person.
I would be too I never win those things!
Very true! Congrats! Its hard to never win
Yes Im sure it makes you anxious. But no sense in worrying!
I know its probably hard not to worry. But it really doesnt change the outcome ya know!
 Cheer up buddy its all in the mind
I believe there must be a good thing that happened these past few years. Count the good ones and block the bad memories out
By being a decent person...Im not a cheater and could never..I am very monogomous..Why would you get married if you wanted that?
I think so. Having integrity and good character would stop you from doing that would you want to be cheated on? You should be honest with your partner..or work on and water your relationship if you dont like it the way it is. Cheating after 10 years would truly make you a terrible person to waste someone elses life for 10 years only to go through such a betrayal.
Thats great. How long was he gone?
Wow. Was he hurt at all?
That is a good feeling
I do agree with you
I bet! I am glad you have a good relationship with a sibling! Thats rarer nowadays
How far are you guys apart in age?
Thats terrible Im sorry to hear that.
I hope she makes it up to you.
I love shrimp nachos but any nachos are good really
What do you put on your nachos?
Wow thats really extreme. You should feel bad about it.
What do you need to leave?
How cool is this? I won free ice cream for a year from my local creamery!
It was a raffle!
I can understand that! I actually attempted a diet about a month ago and it was miserable. What made you give it up?
That seems like the best option. It is hard to stick to a diet for a set amount of time. The weight always seems to return.
Did you roll down your window and yell at him?
Gagging? So you dont do that? 
Oh really? Is that your favorite month?
That sounds like a lot of fun! Which mountains?
I love pizza
I am sorry
Its hard to find people to help move.
Thats good that your brother helped. My daughter I moved alone.
was he hurt?
oh thats good
Oh no! Did you end up finding out who did it?
I would go to HR about it and let them know. 
Oh no! Your friends didnt offer to buy you a drink or something? I would if I wanted my friend to come
That sounds delicious! How nice of her!
She sounds like it! Youre lucky to have such a caring mom!
What is the name of your band?
Thats a lot. What kind of music do you play
Whered they go?
It takes some getting used especially since you havent been alone in a while.
What kind of shoes?
Converse go with everything too!
I love the beach. We can only go once a year!
Well. you will get back there.
That is sad. Sometime pets are iirreplaceable.
What was her name?
I am sorry that is terrible
sorry to hear that. what age group
hah.. thats cool
That would be great.  They dont tell you in advance you just have to find out when you get the check?
Thats good and bad I guess.  It would probably be nice to be able to plan on it.
That is nice the ones I use play the same songs over and over!
I agree and most of the music is older music too.
Oh no thats so awful. Were you able to recover?
Yea. That would make me cautious as well. I hope nothing like that happens again to you.
Id be mad too! Do you have any idea who could have stolen it?
Thats terrible. Well you know what they say about karma theyll get theirs eventually.
Dont go check! lol
Oh lol. Well if you have a weapon keep it near you.
That is definitely a no no
oh wow! what did they get?
wow camaros are awesom.i just got a new suv
Why he is so much better then the other option. I mean they were all crazy but I cant imagine a regime under Clinton. 
Honestly they are both crazy. Its a sad time when those two were the best we had to offer.
I would hate that
I would too
oh thats sweet. is he paying for insurance too? 
oh well.. at least you got some wheels.. beats taking the bus or walking
Why do you do that
That is not too bad
I know that feeling
IT is the worst. My landlord take forever to get things fixed.
awesome! What are you studying?
Thats a great career! We need good counselors in schools!
I am so sorry to hear about your dog did you rescue her?
I bet so I am glad you were able to save her!
jesus lord...I hope you kicked her out or left!
She is a fill in the blank she cheated and betrayed you and your marriage...she would never win in court after cheating. I am so very sorry. There is nothing like being betrayed by someone you love
Did you call an animal shelter?
Did you give him some food?
OH no! Did every one hear?
Thats so bad lol
Thats great! I wish mine did but theyre dreading their first day back tomorrow.
Maybe it will Ill keep my fingers crossed for you!
oh thats good.. did you get to keep some pictures?
wow that was a good idea
Oh I am sorry to hear that but I am sure there might be an even better one out there for you.
Its a tough going through the job market in general. Persistence is the key. Youll get one.
I can understand that. It can be quite scary.
That is a long time to not be alone!
Cangratulations!!!!  Is this your first child?
That will be the best Christmas present ever!
Thats never a fun situation I always bring someone.
Meet somewhere public like a store parking lot.
The entitlement everywhere is terrible! Did you find out who did it?
Well..you could put a box of something that looked good and put dont touch and put exploding ink in it Then you will know 
did you call the cops?
that sucks. karma will come
Oh! Mine broke too this past weekend but I got a new one as it was just a cheap dirt devil. I am glad yours is fixed!
Yes 200 is expensive. It is always good to fix them if you can especially for the nicer ones
Oh man doesnt that just make you want to take a car and run right..... Just kidding.. but yeah that would make my blood boil
Yes! I agree! I guess a lot of people say 3 strikes and your out Im done but for me I dont care who you are I just dont give even second chances to most people!
I love Christmas
Does everyone live far apart?
I know what you mean because I do it too
hahaha you dont say 
But now you have a new pet to live with you
Haha I love them. They eat other pest like bugs and mice. Wait until you cat dose that again.
That sounds fun! Do you have a boat or jet skis?
Oh for sure! I love riding jet skis!
That is great to hear.  What is making you so happy?
Great news.  Kids are always an exciting adventure!
That was very nice of her. What did you do with the money?
That is a good use of the 100 bucks. I am sure you will pay it forward at some point.
Yeah theyre sometimes hard starts to the week. Did anything bad happen to you this monday or was it just slowmoving? Hopefully things pick up for you.
Man thats terrible. Im sorry to hear that. Hopefully you can recover. 
Oh no I have been there! I hope everything goes okay!
Dont worry about it worrying will only make things worse.
Oh no! Were you home when it happened?
Im so glad you werent there but I still hate to hear it. Did they take anything valuable?
I understand.  I dont like bad weather either.
Was it a tornado?
What kind of band
I like that music
Ugh I hate when people do that! Did they even leave a note?
Of course. Well karma will get them one day. At least it wasnt a full on accident where you couldve gotten injured.
oh wow.. i call that a win!
I bet it can be easy for that to happen in the spur the moment
Youll have a shot at it again Im sure!
What is that? A video game?
No worries we all have our hobbies!
aww. i can imagine that its really different now in the house.
i felt the same avout my moms dog when he passed.something was missing in the house.
I hate that! Where theyre probably friendly but because theyre so big you have no idea what could or would happen so you get so defensive..
My brother has a large lab although theyre pretty sure it has to be part of something else because its over a hundred pounds and looks much bigger than a normal lab. Shes a sweet dog has the energy of a puppy though so she comes tearing at you with speed and you think youre about to die.. But shes just being playful.
Im sorry to hear that. Whats been going on?
Troubling times do make us extra vulnerable.
Any gf or bf? That would be scary yet wonderful!
I would take someone who would be thrilled about it 
Oh NO...That should be reserved for the worst prisoners. That hurts!
Thats understandable. I bet people have had those stuck in their feet before
Oh no no no no no! Thats no man! If you arent going to fix it then earn money to hire someone who will!
Yes! I would agree! I feel bad your in that situation!
yea it can really hit hard
Wow! That takes a lot of schooling I hope you do too! Is it a good company?
I have been there before. Sometimes you just need to relax!
It is we all need time for ourselves!
what are you studying?
oh wow that sounds impressive. good luck!
That is awesome! Are you going to celebrate?
How fun! I hope you have a great time!
What kind of game is that
It sounds cool
And what was the verdict?
Hard work goes a long way!
I love days like that! Hopefully you got a chance to play outside?! 
So fantastic that you could take advantage of it  and get to make some memories with your kids!
yes technology is great
yea and now smart phones are everything!
Why did it irk you? was he not suppose to be there?
Have you confronted him about it yet?
Did you not pass?
Awesome! I am happy for you!
Kids are the best
That sounds very nice
Aw thats no good are you going to buy new ones or patch them up?
Sorry to hear that hopefully someone will help you out with that.
Nothing to be ashamed about.  There are lots of people much older that are still into gaming.  If youre really good you could actually make money on it!
Hahaha.  Nothing says you cant do both.  Work at work play after work.
that was really nice of them  they are good co workers 
Thats very heart warming to hear
Sounds like an old coaster they should consider replacing.
That sounds exciting! Are you going to see him for the holidays?
What school are you applying to?
That is a tough school to get into. Best of luck.
Thats pretty cool.  How long have you been together in this relationship
Well have a safe flight and make sure you make the most of it!
Oh thats...interesting. That does sound like a nice change of plans not only because Starbucks not seem that fun anyway. Hopefully she returned the favor?
Well hopefully she doesnt keep you waiting for very long if everything else is right! But maybe be more patient than even you think you need to be in order to play it safe so she doesnt get scared off so to speak. Sounds like it will be worth it in the end.
Why dont you get one then so cute.
That sucks. I hope that changes in the future for you.
That really stinks. Maybe they will take the hint?
Well thats good!
Thats awesome to hear!
Thats good news. Congratulations in advance!
That is not your fault
She must have a golden heart
I hope you have showered her with gifts and appreciation she deserves it
yea this is a much better time for content
yea i can see that also
Hopefully you wont have to walk when its dark out again or at least have people to walk with you.
Do you guys still keep in touch with video chats and phone calls?
Thats what helped me when I moved away.  Video chatting makes it feel like youre still there
What is so creepy
I am sure you are finr
It happens you cant beat yourself up about it it was an accident!
That sucks. Are you going to tell your boss?
Well thats a good attitude
congratulations! that is an awesome achievnment 
that is always a perfect combo!
That is bad. Did you do it on purpose?
Mistake can easily happened. Nothing to worry about.
how was the game!
Why were you impressed
I am not sure it was
That would have made me sad  poor kitten 
I love animals  i would feel the same as you
wow surprise gifts are the best!
what a good friend. Im glad you had a good birthday
I do as well
What happened then
Is he doing better?
Well thats good. I bet he appreciated you taking care of him
That is sweet and sentimental.
I am happy that you have that to remember him by.
Oh man I forgot about Cracker Jacks.  I always looked for the prize
It always makes me think about baseball when I think of Cracker Jacks
Oh no that must have ruined the round!
Hopefully you got a refund.
I am hoping as well
That would be very nice
sounds like a good friend to have by your side
Thats understandable! Just be yourself and Im sure you will do great!
A tip someone gave me once is to make sure to have really good posture as it makes you appear less nervous! Fake it till you make it! Good luck!
Oh no that classic prank! I bet that was painful Ive only seen it on movies.
Haha wow thats awesome.  Sort of makes up for him playing that prank on you.
cheer up buddy everyone have experienced that at one point or the other
no worries buddy the experience will make you stronger
For a test? Its good that your confident thats key!
Youll get the highest grade Im sure!
Oh thats good! Any special reason?
Oh that is wonderful news! Congratulations!
Making new friends can be tough is there anyone at work you bond with?
I am sure that you will meet some new friends
That is amazing  Is there a certain reason she cant swim  she just never learned?
was her life jacket fancy?
That mustve been terrifying in your dream.
I hope you dont have many of those dreams again.
did you pass?
hard work pays off!
Why were you scared
Wow sounds like you need a new store..haha
Do you wear glasses or do you have 2020 vision
Thats good  Give it some time  Did everything go good besides the high and dry?
That sounds good Give it time she will come around.
Im so sorry are you okay?
I did see that
He wont win anything
Ill keep my fingers crossed that its good for you! Is that your favorite food?
I didnt know it was healthy!
Curiousity gets to ya sometimes.
hahaha so why did you watch it?
that is such a bomber will you still be able to go on your trip?
thats not good at all  have you tried asking for someones car?
Oh no Im sorry to hear that.
Im sure it was. Did insurace cover what was lost?
I hope you do too! I have always hated group work.
I guess so I just hate that my grade would depend on someone elses work.. or lack there of.
That is great what school did he go to?
Wow that is a tough school to get into. Did you pay the tuition?
That is so annoying.  I thought they were not supposed to be allowed to call anymore.
I heard they are based outside of the country and make calls out of reach of the law.  Like I said ANNOYING!
im sorry to hear that.. old age?
he lived a long life.
Oh no were you able to track it down?
Aw sorry to hear that hope heshe is fine and youll able to find it.
I bet that was nice
I am so sorry for your loss. How was was he?
He had a good life yea?
Were you scared
Its not good to be jealous of your friends.
Im glad you made that connection.
Gee thats sucks. Have you tried contacting them?
Thats terrible service. I hope you get it resolved soon!
Wow. I guess she really has no care for social constructs.
it would make me lose my appetite. Oh well what could you have done?
Why are you hesitant
Then just tell him no.  If its meant to be hell respect it
yes and staying away from addicts is always good as well! Pick a different hobby for sure thats healthy is good!
YES! I used to be very social but I have had enough of that and now I am happy to be at home and at peace 0
What game was it?
Oh that sounds fun! Did you go in person or watch on tv?
That was nice of them
I bet you were
It is good to find some time for ourself to rest.
Thats really rude of them I guess no one taught them manners.
Someone else should have looked out for you though.
Thats very sweet to even reach that age and to retire! I hope he gets to do fun things now?
You dont know?
It has been long
I agree. I put a lot of effort into my work and I hate when things are half done.
I am sorry! I have been there before and it is no fun!
Wow thats super exciting.  I hope you do too.  What would you go for?
Very nice.  I think youll get it.  I believe in you
Thats very nice of her not too many left that would offer to do that for a stranger.
Thats really cool hope you two become BFFs!
Oh no!  im sorry I have been there before too many times.  Just know everything happens for a reason 
Good! I try my best to live by that.  Its hard sometimes though  Life is weird.
Well thats not good
I guess you did
Mustve been embarassing.
Were you walking and suddenly tripped on something you didnt see?
Oh man how come?
Oh that is a bummer maybe you can around work as its worth it 
Oh no. Did you take out a payday loan?
Im sorry to hear that. Well I hope its over with soon.
I hear they are good
They are talented for sure
What did your brother do?
Thats really nice of him. Sounds like you won the sibling lottery.
Wow thats nice. How was the taste?
Oh I see! Still a great gesture to get a cake.
Your roommate is awesome. Im glad you werent stranded.
I had horrible roomates. Im glad you gotta keeper.
Thats creepy do you think youre in trouble for something or is it someone random?
I would do so just as a precaution can never be too careful!
I feel the same way! I mean my Facebook feed is full of all this garbage.
I actually use a special extension on my browser so I can block certain things like this on my Facebook! You should try it!
you must be nervous but im sure you will be fine
hahaha that might be a small proble but nothing to be worried about
Dang! I hate when that happens.  Its always the day you dont expect it to happen it happens.
Thats always a nice alternative could be worse.
Oh man I should do that too.
Thats good. What did you get for preparation?
Oh Im so very sorry! I know its very hard to lose a loved one I lost my sister father and both sets of grandparents.
Yes even though its part of life it doesnt make it any better when it happens. I hope it starts to get better for you soon.
Nice where are you headed
Thats pretty awesome  is it your whole family going or just you and a significant other
wow sound serious. you do this everyday?
thats a nice committment you got there. congrats
I would love that car
I am in the same boat
What game will you be going to?
I love baseball who is playing in the game you are going to?
Not a lot of people are loyal. Who is this someone?
Being a punching bag in a relationship is no good. Its a 2 way street. Is your partner doing their part?
Thats pretty awesome! I feel my skin jump a bit when I see how much people spend on one day
I feel the same! No use spending that on something that will be eaten either
Oh how do you feel about that?
Are you going to allow it then?
How did they feel about that?
I can understand not wanting a big wedding I wish I would have made a different decision.  Good for him.
That is such a noble thing to do.  Do you work with an organization or on your own.
That makes sense.  Well you are doing a lot of good.
Thats great it can take awhile for boys to get the hang of it all.
That is very lucky
I am glad she did
Thats awesome that your dad helped you out with math.
Was? Is he no longer around?
Thats so sad! Im glad you have something to remember him by.
He will always live on through spirit in your heart. Im sorry for the loss.
Ah thats too bad. But exciting at the same time! Do you have a particular car in mind?
Yes I heard the same thing! Cheap on parts too!
i would have been as well going on vacation is really fun. are you going with family?
that is really fun place to go with family i was there last year and really enjoyed it
Well I hope that it turns out well!
Yeah that makes a lot of sense. Good thinking!
Wow. Sounds like you have a wonderful boss. Sarcasm by the way.
Is he always this way?
Its just a boat
I can get that sometimes
Seems like a silly thing to be nervous about unless youre a terrible driver.
Well to each their own. They have driving classes if you ever feel like you need them.
Thats amazing. What was the meeting about?
You earned it! Good job!
That was nice of her.  How did it come out?
Awesome.  What color is it.  Happy Birthday by the way!
I am with you on that one
I hate it
Congratulations to him. Is he younger or older?
Ah so youre the young one. Do you look up to him?
You need to induldge every once and awhile right?
I heard they can keep you from hitting a pleateu.
Aw sorry to hear that...why is she moving
nice well if you keep in touch everyday maybe it wont feel so far
oh yea? did you try to keep up with him?
ah thats true
That must have been fun! I love dogs. What kind was it?
Fun I have a friend who has one of those. Theyre very playful.
It was? What made it hard specifically? Hopefully nothing too bad happened.
Yeah Im with you. I hate going to especially Walmart because its so freaking crowded all the time. Its a hassle getting even the shortest shopping list. But Im on a budget and its where I have to go.
Thanks for the awesome tip. I appreciate you trying to think of an alternative for me! Ill give it a look.
Very true! Maybe a gioter and she needs more minerals thats what it is a lot.
yes! Research is a life saver never just rely on doctors..they almost killed me and many I know. I hope its not too bad!
Almost all my family members have smoked at one point in time. I feel bad for the people that get caught in the addiction and I wish I could help them quit. Sorry to hear its such a hassle enough that you had to do it inside.
Hey I really hope you do. It was partly why my dad had a stroke and then had health problems the rest of his life. But Im sure you get that all the time. You have to do it for you not because of horror stories and all that. I hope you get through it though.
Aw Im sorry to hear that is she getting up there in age?
Hopefully they will diagnose her correctly and she becomes her normal self. Fingers crossed!
Is it working well still
Its nice to have
Im glad youre getting used to it now.
Oh yea the Teslas look pretty amazing!
Maybe theyll be more affordable and even slicker when you get around to it.
Thats a very supportive family you have.  Im right there with you on the credit mine is not too good.
Make sure you tell them you love them when you see them next! 
Thats super sketchy of him.  I never accept checks from people.  Only cash. just in case
hopefully you will still get the money
I do not like mine as well
That is annoying
I have no idea what kind of ingredients you even put in a mug cake?
Pretty much they have problems in their own lives.
Yep. If people were truely happy they wouldnt have time to troll others.
Thats awesome. Sounds like you were well prepared for it.
Thats great! Congratulations on getting it!
oh thats nice. do you all have plans?
that sounds great.
That sounds fun! Do you have a first date planned?
Ah okay good plan. Im sure she will go out with you. Just dont sound too desperate. 
Wow. Must be a sight for those behind you all this time.
Its ok. Im sure everyone has their embarassing moments.
That is awesome.  it is great when a schedule works out.
You know thats right.  I love food although I just recently became a vegan.
I wish I had a car.
Only if i find the money
I am sure it will
I bet it smells nice
That sucks. Maybe theres a next time?
I hope youll get another opportunity or even a better one.
How did you do that can you remember the last place you had it? 
I know was it an important sentiment to your family? I hope it comes up eventually.
My brother used to always do that to me.
Family should help as much as possible.
maybe you should try making some again
Thats awesome. Job hunting can be difficult.
I feel sorry for th 19 people who didnt get it.
I bet it will be okay
It happens to everyone
Have you talked to him about it? Why wouldnt he be able?
Ah work always seems to find a way to get in the way.
Heck yeah! I love the fair mainly for the food and people watching!
Yum! Dont forget about the corndogs.
Is it a pretty decent raise?
Ill keep my fingers crossed that it happens for you. I dont think a boss would give a hint like that for no reason!
Thats terrible. Did you find your dog?
Im sorry to hear that. I hope you find him soon.
ah sounds like the smart move
What i that?!?! i think ive heard the name before maybe.
I see  What happened? bad recipe?
Oh god. Thats awful. I guess she never came back?
I hope she was able to fend for herself. Im sorry she went through that loss.
I wish i could make that type of money!
Money is what runs the world.
Cool congrats I can never win those
Well arent you the Lucky the Leprechaun...how much have you won so far
That is cool I guess
That is the story of my life.
The weekends are for the boys!
Gotta hate weather like that when youre trying to get somewhere. You ok?
Thats good. So many peole just drive faster.
She seems work hard
Shes one lucky girl!
How long have you guys been together?
hopefully you do and remember the movie trailers and commercials take a while before the actual movie plays
do you have a date ?
Why? Whats going on this weekend?
Oh my gosh thats exciting.  Youre going to have such a fun time.  I love roller coasters
And if you need to just close your eyes
What is happening Friday?
oooh thats exciting!  I hope you get good news on Friday!!  
they must be a really good resturaunt
those are definitely reasons to keep going back
i bet! congrats
that was awesome of you all
Did you end up going out?
Im so happy for you.
That sounds so gross
It sounds that way
I love sauces like that
I do agree
Oh yum! I love cake! That was nice of her!
Ill bet it was! I hope you thanked her! Cake takes time and effort to make!
That sounds exciting! The hard work will pay off. Ive always wanted to camp. Have you done it before?
Is it just you or will others be joining you?
Ive really glad you and your do are getting along well. Dogs are mans best friend after all!
Yeah but it is worth it because now you have a loyal and obedient partner. 
Wow. What happened?
Thats gotta be embarassing.
That is awesome normally it is the opposite!
Your dog is an angel!
Sounds like a goal to me. Good luck!
Youre welcome. Goals is what makes life matters sometimes.
Im eating some pepperoni pizza as Im typing this.. washing it down with some beer my kind of Tuesday night
What are your default pizzas.  Mine are Little Cs or Dominoes
Was the dog okay
I am glad you did
Thats awesome! you and me can go eat!
Hopefully it is a great place to eat and we enjoy it!
Yeah they are horrible
Reminds me of when I was younger but I always acted like I liked it to make her happy.
Just make sure you drop the hint in a nice way!
Thats a long drive.
Any way for you to maybe go to them next time?
What kind of car is it?
Nice!  I would secretly be a little envious myself they are nice cars.
It will figure itself out always does
I am sure it will be
Did find your dog?
what are you going to do with it ?
That is the way to go! Keep it up!
Work is pretty great and makes a bunch of money!
That is crazy
That is funny
Thats some dedication!
Good luck! Im sure youll do great!
I would have cried for multiple days!
Do you have a new place to eat?
Thats no fun. I had a cat that would escape all the time too. Did you get it back?
Thats not too bad. I had to pick mine up at the animal shelter. 
I hope you do well
I can tell
Thats not cool. Will you get it fixed?
Sounds like a plan.
That is bad
I can imagine
i would have been to. what happened?
oh well that happens
where were his parents?
ah that stinks
Aww!  Maybe its time to start building yours!
Maybe you should start saving up some extra money so you can make yours better!!
That is a good thing
She sounds amazing
Oh yuck! Sounds like a disgusting experience.
Haha that must have felt a bit satisfying at least. Glad you took care of them.
Right on glad to hear it. I hate utility bills and how unexpectedly high they can be. I especially hated living with roommates who didnt mind getting them really high just for the sake of having it a little cooler.
I hope it stays that way for you. Luckily Im in an apartment now where the utilities are included so I dont have to stress about what its going to be or confronting my roommates.
Marriage is a very hard thing.
I like all of my partners too much.
Ohh yeah that sounds really good.
I see what are you going to do to make sure it doesnt happen again?
Thats terrible! Why did you feel scared?
Oh no I always feel the same way. I usually avoid areas like that.
oh thats good that he felt comfortable enough to tell you
thats cool that he was able to come out on his own terms
Thats rad those are slick looking cars!
Its time to one up him and get a Porsche!
It is a good thing that you care.
I wish I lived in your fine community.
Sounds like you prepared well congratulations! What do you think you got?
Thats always a good sign.  When you feel good about it you did well.
oh man! i would also be irate. why the delay?
i hate fight delays
Date them both? Then pick which one you like the most.
you should bite first and take them both home!
Thats too bad..you sure it was the milk and not something else?
Can you drink any dairy? Or is that totally off limits
Did you kick him in the shen?
Okay maybe punch him in the nose.
Then what happened?
Did you do well
You will do better next time
Did someone punch you?
Maybe someone kicked you in the eye!
I dont believe that
Just dont give up
There is no such things as happy days
Happy days fly away so quickly.
Oh no thats terrible! Do you know who did it?
I hope its not too expensive to fix!
well thats gross
i can only imagine
Thats a real positive spirit!
I like your attitude. 
Hopefully its not a big one that would cause serious damage I assume? Otherwise I kind of like storms. I like the sound of rain and the visual aspect. Its the best when you get to fall asleep to them.
I live near the coast and we have hurricane scares all the time. For some reason people love to stay behind and just face the storm. Theyre fearless and think everything will be okay even when sometimes its not. I guess theyre just determined to stay by their homes and not abandon them which I can understand. Ill hope for the best for you!
Ive never had the guts to do that even though Ive wanted to on multiple occasions. What happened if you dont mind me asking?
Thats the worst... So it wasnt even just taste it was about health.. Dang. I dont know if I could ever go back there again. Itd always be in the back of my mind. Glad you caught it early and didnt go home with too much food poisoning.
that is good.i always loved sports as a kid and did well
it is a great way to learn that.im glad i was able to learn those values.
I agree....were you just looking through some photos or what
smh time flies now that you mention it...I was just going through old fb beach pics of me and an ex I was planning to marry but we fell off and it hits me like a sucker punch every time
Congratulations! what do you do?
Sounds like you have some real talent there.  Keep up the good work.  I bet youll be famous one day!
what is it worth?
hah thats awesome.. canceled of course.. but awesome
I do not even have a dog
I have always wanted one.
I am glad it was resolved.
I sure hope that happens.
Thats awful news! I dont want to sound cruel but at least this could maybe be a period of your life where you can just focus on you and improve a lot of areas of your life. You could look at it like a second chance.
Yeah that happened to my roommate recently. I didnt try to give him too much specific advice because most of it is just useless. I just tried to help him realize the best he can do is be patient because time makes everything feel better or at least hurt less.
conrats. what did you get?
why what happened?
i would feel the same way
Now I feel bad about talking to you.  Do you mind talking to me?
Who are these people?
Is it your baby.
We will see once the baby comes out and is tested!
I feel that way every day almost Did you ever end up doing it?
What made you so tired??
Did she find out you broke your promise?
Its great that you both were able to work it out.
I love swimming!
No no! Forget those shorts! be you!
Nice. What was the award for?
Sheesh thats heavy.  Sorry to hear that.  Have you talked it over yet or no
Well maybe its for the best.  Good luck
You are not the only. Nothing to worry about.
I am a guy. Why this question?
That sounds like a fun weekend! Did you go swimming?
That sound fun! I love to eat fresh fish!
Hey that sounds like an awesome day!  
Good for you my friend!  We all need days like that!
Oh no poor little thing.
I am so heartbroken thinking about it.  Im sorry.
Oh WOW!  That is a lot of cakes!!  Will you be able to get it all done?
Well more power to you!  I dont think I could do that in one night  you must be a good baker.
Man Im jealous! Im still a college student barely paying rent! And nothing but student loans to look forward to. I probably should have taken your path in life. Not to say you havent worked very hard for it because Im sure you have.
Hey I really appreciate that advice. I need to take it. Im horrible at setting goals. I just move in a general direction. I need to break things down step by step. Well see how it goes.
sorry to hear that my brother has a drinking problem too and has kids i love him but at this point we are more focused on the kids  i tell him if you get locked up who is gonna raise the girls  of course we are but still they need a father 
all you can do is stay positive  all we can hope is our brothers will one day wake up before its to late 
I never win and i play all the time!
This is very true!
awesome.  When are they coming and for how long?
Thats a long trip.  I hope they have a good time
Right now I am sure is too early!
We are going in December and it is going to be magical.
UGH thats the worst  I once ran my car dry of oil..oops.
I try to get a change every time the sticker says  thats one thing i dont mind paying for.
I would have cried for years.
Life does throw things at us.
oh awesome.. i couldnt never do that
you should be fine
Oh man.  I hope he is alright I would be nervous too
What?! I would have been livid! Did they compensate you?
ohhhhh maybe turn it into a little vacation
Oh no! Hey I wouldnt say a better man. Im sure you are just fine for someone else. She didnt deserve you.
Okay yeah a lot of people seem to have that problem. Maybe you can learn from it for next time.
So the women only like you because you have money?
Well on paper you are like a dream catch no doubt about it.
Do you mean out of control
Yes Id agree with you. I still think its hilarious that hes president...didnt think know Republicans had such a scarce lineup
how is it going?
thats the way to be! 
Hey thats awesome!  What kind of job is it?
Oh.  Wait.  What?
Its easy to be intimidated by pretty girls.
You really dont I agree.
Oh my  do you ever geta  weird feeling when it looks at you?
That is crazy! maybe its you from the future!
That sound like a lot of fun! Will it be your first time?
Thats sounds like a great experience. I hope you enjoy it!
It is so hard to wait.  What console did you get?
That is so awesome.  I hope it gets there before this weekend so you can binge it!
damn that stinks
Wow was it difficult? do they eat alot.
Why? What happened? Is everything okay?
Yes loneliness can be quite sad.
Is that a good thing?
Great! That is how it should always be  
Ah thats difficult. Maybe you can see if there are any sports teams you can join?
Yeah I know what you mean. Im in a similar situation right now as well.
Ouch I hate it when that happens. Did you say anything to them?
Thats super rude. Hopefully karma will take care of that. 
no facebook is the devil!

Yes animals are our best friends.
Well it is natural maybe bad food choice?
Oh you shouldnt be. Dont eat before church though

Oh! I cant read very well tonight. Where did you book?
have you tried contacting the company about it?
Why what did they do to betray your trust?
I would be so mad I dislike when companys charge my card did you call to get a refund for the charge?

That is good to hear.
That sounds like fun what band is playing.
Im going on a guided fishing trip next month
What was it that gave you problems?
That was generous of him.  But continue to work on your punctuality.
Did they find out where the kid was at?
Maybe she skipped the school for the day?
Was it a lot of fun?
Im glad you had a nice time...and they found the child by the way it was an error.
Im really happy that he made it. I bet it was a tough thing to go through.
I know what you mean. I wish my dad were still around.
Yea that wouldnt of turn out great.
Good to their safe.
Thats nice that you have someone you can trust like that.
Im glad for you on all of that.
Oh man that sounds like a pain.
Thats not good. You didnt get in trouble for that did you?
Can you retake the test?
Ouch thats bad.  Study hard. Im sure youll do better next time
That sounds fun but  be careful if theres rough weather!
I hope you catch a BIG ONE or more  have a great time!
That does sound like a lot of fun
Is he better now ?
I hope he continues to improve. Its bad when a loved one is ill.
yea that can be hard when things remind you of people
Sometimes you have to just look at the positives though and smile about it
At least you had a lot of fun
Well they will get over it
what kind of project was it? Its always satisfying to see hard work pay off.
Im sure youll reap the rewards at your job in the long term.
ill try not to laugh i promise.  Tell me about it!
ouch.  well i hope youre ok.
Well that is just great. Congrats!
How is it going?
It happens like that. Dont give up.
Im sorry. How long have you been together ?
Well maybe its for the best if you can move on.
Sounds like youre feeling pretty confident. I hope you get the promotion!
I think you will. Just keep doing a good job and keep your confidence up.
Yuck. At least it wasnt IN your house. That is gross.
I would be placing traps all inside my house in case it ever comes inside.
That must have brought back a lot of memories
good ones I hope.
Thats great! I need to start saving money myself.
Yeah it would be really nice to have some backup funds in case something happens.
poor dog  did he survive the impact ?
hopefully he survived the incident
Is it because you are there for him?
He would probably appreciate you doing that.
Oh no. What is wrong? 
That is such a pain. Do you have a credit card to use in the meantime? 
Vacations are the best.   Where are you going?
Ive heard a lot of good things about Austin but ive never been.  Ive always wanted to go
Did you have any damage ?
Im glad you came through it safely.
That has got to feel good!  Did you get a raise or a new job?
Congratulations!  Your life should feel a little less stressful when you get it!
Anticipation sucks. The hints dont help you figure it out?
HAHA thats a shame. Its just like having to stare at Christmas gifts for a month but not being able to open them as a kid.
These places should have them clean because it is inevitably these things happen
There are jobs that are hard
You must be so proud. Im sure she put in a lot of work to learn.
Wow so talented. That must make you very happy to see them do well at something.
What concert is it ?
What a pleasant surprise.
That sounds like a great memory! I always get nostalgic about pretty much everything. How long ago was it?
I wish I had a group of friends like that. I always just knew people but never got close. 
So peaceful and relaxing right? What a beautiful sight. 
I would too if I could sit outside and enjoy it like you! 
Oh thats great. Is she going to  collge?
What does she want to do?
Oh I hate people like that.    People that flake out like that just have no respect for anyone elses time.
That sucks. You should have went out anyways.
uhoh I hope they dont have a late fee or anything attached to it
make sure you do it when you get home
sorry to hear that  try and keep busy or find a hobby eventually you will get over it its just gonna take a bit of time
the gym is a great place to start  make new friends and get fit
Whoa. That is a big change. That must make you so happy.
Its probably muscle though so you will still look slimmer.
Thats great when you have good maintence for a place.
Thats such a waste of money and food. Glad its working out though.
awesome! congratulation.  So you are enjoying the job now?
Keep doing what youre doing!  I think youll keep moving up that company ladder in no time
I have felt that. It always sucks feeling like you can
Thats the worst. How do they expect people to get around?
Like ever before.
Im well mostly but ready for Fall to come.
and what happened next?
why? He did not do anything bad to you.
Wow I would say the same! Accidents happen but come on pick them up. Im sorry! 
It really is unreal but you know people are getting worse and worse these days. 
Wow how unappreciative they sound. You will be better off at your next job I am sure.
Im sure your next employer will be much better. That is no way to treat an employee.
I bet.  It can be intimidating to start a new regime.
I should start back to working out.  The older I get the harder it seems to begin.  Do you have any advice?
Lol that would be awesome to get some free childcare.  My kids tend to drive me nuts at times.
Yes thank God that summer is finally over!
How long ago has this been?
It never gets too far out of your memory. but it will fade over time. I doubt youll still be feeling like this when youre in the nursing home.
Does that happen often?
And that usually knocks out the power?
Very cool of you to take a stand on something you believe in.
Oh wow. That has to be hard to see. Its great they you are actually doing something about it.
100! I have never won that much!
I wouldnt even know what to do with an extra 100
How did that end? 
Well we give in to our friends. Hopefully he pays you back and not ruin your friendship.
Wow thats a long time to work together did yall meet at work? 
Thats sad. Im so sorry to hear that! 
I know what you mean
There are other girls
Thats awesome that you have saved all of that.  I bet its heartwarming to look back at all of that stuff
You should get some good storage totes and pack it all up so its safe
I know how you feel. One small decision could make everything nowadays different for you.
If you wonder how things would be different youd drive yourself nuts.
Did you see any ghosts?
Ive been to one of those. They sure find ways to get you!
what are you being tested for?
Well I hope you are okay? Did the doctor hint at anything?
Oh yeah is it nice? 
I know it sucks when people get what you need and its out of sight but I hope you get one soon! 
thats great! I bet you are very proud of them!
youre not!  Im sure they will go to college and end up being very successfull
Congrats! When are you going?
That sounds really exciting. Are you taking someone along?
Congradulations. Is this your first time moving in with a boyfriend? 
I think I would be mad too.
This chat has three people in it it seems.  I am talking to two separate Worker2s.
ah thats sad. You must have look forwarded to the trip
Theres always a next time.
Im so sorry! Its always sad losing a friend. 
I remember losing my childhood dog. They always stay in your hear.
It has been really dry here as well.  We are in a severe drought for the third time in four years.
That sounds like a lot of fun! Where are you headed to? 
I am a sucker for some good deals! 
Did you find a new job or retire?
Congratulations I hope you like it
her loss  im glad you didnt get too stressed about therejection
it is. i remember all the drama from my teen years and how i was stressed and crying over really stupid stuff  
Ive never seen that movie why is it depressing?
Oh wow that is very depressing. I hate movies like that.
now thats more depressing  cheer up you eventually find better friends 
not every person in the world is the same  we are all different  i am confident you will find someone 
Congratulations!  Are you going to celebrate?
Why does it take so long to kick in?
Thats too bad. Is she feeling better today?
I hope she feels better. Thats never fun for mom or child.
Were you able to find out what it was?
Be safe they may come back.
Were you expecting them?
What a surprise! I love when friends go above and beyond like that it shows that they really care
I know I hear you... maybe one day we will win the lotto. 
Well I hope one day you get what you want  
Did you have some good food?
What happened today? 
Thats great! What will you guys do together?
Being helpless when waiting for things is the worst feeling. Theres nothing you can do but you need to do something!
yikes that sucks. Hopefully you found one that worked eventually.
Your an outstanding mate and great friend she must have had a hard time my child hood friend died in a car crash and i felt dead inside for a long time
yes i still have dreams of my friend  and he passed 12 years ago  i will never forget him
Thats so sad! Im really sorry.  Have you been researching about it? 
I cant even begin to imagine how hard that must be. Stay strong! 
Did she break anything ? How old is she ?
Hopefully no breaks.
I agree it is good to have something to look forward to. 
I completely agree
But did you even hesitate and think about it?
Thats good to hear.  Is there any chance of promotion in the future.
Are they hiring? I could use a new job. 
That is annoying. I wish public transportation was better in the city.
Maybe see if you can do your grocery shopping to. Maybe that will save you from having to do it later in the week.
What was it ? Im a music lover.
That is one of the tunes that is on the gold record flying out of our solar system on the Voyager probe.
Thats terrible to hear...  When did you find that out? 
Ugh I dont even know how to respond to that other than to tell you to hang in there. Lots of positive and love your way. 
What sorts of places have you been going? Alone time is always great but then sometimes it gets to be too much so I understand.
You could always do that but maybe exploring on your own can give you a different perspective on things.
Have you tried sharing it to your friends on social media?
Just keep cranking them out. YOur videos will get better and your channel will grow. I know it can be annoying at first.
How do you think you did?
I think youll do just fine.   Do you still have to take the BAR exam after?
Congrats! That is so cool!
That is really something to be proud of!
That does sound like fun!  What is the came called?
That sounds amazing!  You all must have really enjoyed playing it!
Are you on wireless or a wired network?
Wow that sounds terrible. I really do hope you fix your internet problem.
Congratulations. I bet you cant wait.
You are gonna do great. Enjoy your time before you start work.
Ugh I would be bummed too. Dont give up tho! 
I know but you will have so many more summers coming up you got this 
Wow.  Have you studied for them?
That is great!  What classes are they in?
Just enjoy as much time as you can with them  losing loved ones is never easy
thats sad to hear 
Thats fantastic. How old are you?
Keep up the good work.
oh no why do you think like that.. All should be good
ah ok. If intuition tells not to fly. Lets not take chance. you should skip the flight
Im sure you did great do you have doubts that you didnt?
It sucks having to wait for something like that I know but it will be here soon enough. Try to relax.
that must be pretty frustrating
maybe you should have a talk with her
Oh really? What did they do?
Wow! That was really nice of them.
How did you hurt it?
That really sucks I hope you feel better and can take her another day!
that is ridiculous! thats annoying when people dont clean up after their dogs! I love going to the local park with my son and there is dog poop in the grassy areas
It is plus its so antisanitary
You shouldve called the police if they didnt listen to you
It sucks that you were forced to
Has it been a long time? 
Oh whoa. That is pretty crazy. Hopefully yall can become friends again.
I would have been feeling the same way too. Oh well maybe she thought it was cute. 
No way! Come on. You are a champ walk back in there. 
That is great do they enjoy it?
That is awesome I am sure it makes you happy
Oh no. I bet he felt really bad about it.
Is it repairable at all?
Thats great Im glad you are transitioning to something new so well.
Thats great how did you repay her?
That would be a nice gesture
a surprise party that is awesome  did you have fun ?
im really happy for you 
Well thats part of being in the workforce work when everyone is looking hang out when they are not. Most people arent paid enough to care
Sounds a bit harsh but business is business
I could imagine. Its a big day you both waited so long for.
Im sure once it was over you realized that you would be okay with that.
Old memories are the best. Do you plan to go back again soon?
That sounds good hope you have a great time
Thats so impressive! You must be proud. 
I would be too. Thats amazing. Good for her! 
Awesome You saved yourself a ton of money by doing that!
Yeah I could not imagine life without the internet
im sure that you will find another soon
im sorry i read that wrong. i am very happy for you!
Yuck! I dont think Id be able to hold back my own puke if that happened to me.
I know what you mean.  Theres some crazy stuff out there about it too!
The Berenstein bears one i think is crazy
What was it that happened to you?
They are hungry little beast.
Where are you getting lunch?
That sounds fun! Are you going with anyone?
im sorry that is awful
eventually you will feel better again
I bet that will go in the record books. How old is she? 
Thats amazing. You must be proud. Good for her! 
Whats it all about?
Sounds like she just needs some time to settle in and catch her breath.
Congratulations! thats awesome.  Does he know what hes going for?
Wow so he must be really smart then.  Make sure he doesnt do too much partying like I did.
That is so awesome you must  be so proud!
Thats so sweet. How did that make you feel?
Yes! We will be planning a second birthday soon! I cant wait!
Who are you talking about?
Oh awesome yes childbirth is an amazing feeling
thats awesome i bet you were very thankful
thats what family is for
Thats awesome! I bet youre really proud of her.
I really hope that you continue to encourage her! She may have a future as an artist.
What was that secret? 
All the best for your exams!
You need to take care of the elderly I am sure she has cared for you your whole life
Have you talked to her about this ?
Then use her yard as a garbage can. Thats what she does to yours.
I am sure it does. What kind of truck is it? 
sounds super cool! 
Hey! Yes I do actually especially when its nice out.
I carry it in my nalgene wide mouth water bottle. What about you?
Is she far away from you now?
Oh can you go across there and visit her?
Oh yeah what was that? 
That is super sweet of them! So nice. 
That was not very nice of him. Did your parents react well?
What a mean thing to do.
Yeah Im taking care of her for the last few months. 
yeah i should
Could you help her out once in awhile?
Well that is really considerate!
Haha you could have played it off as cute and clumsy and maybe they would have been into it
Yea thats a good idea.  Be like hopefully I dont spill this one on me too
What do you have coming up? Ill keep you in mind.
Just have confidence. It sounds like you already know the outcome. If she says no just dont make a big deal out it.
What was it that you did to feel so courageous?? 
That is well worth taking a chance on since the risk of rejection did not happen and the payoff was a good outcome. She said yes! 
ha ha ha thats a good one tho! Your parents tho omg. Thats funny but I am sure it wasnt in the moment. 
I know I would have been super upset in the moment. 
Was everything okay? Did it take long for the power to come back?
That is scary! I hope nothing came inside
Are you pretty bad with math?
Well maybe you will get a good overall grade and pass!
Is it a hurricane or something worse?
Oh no stay indoors for sure!
Thats awesome! What kind of car is it?
Yeah Im jealous. Youre so lucky!
I know it was terrible. Are you from vegas? 
ugh well i hope no one in your family was affected 
That is great I am so happy for you what industry are you in?
Thats all that matters and your happiness 
Oh my God thats terrible.
Well I will pray for you and I hope our advanced medicine and doctors can cure him.
Keep your head up and ask around if anyone has oppurtunites for you
It will get better its always darkest just before the dawn
That happens sometimes.  How did you end up doing in the end?
Dont sweat it.  Theres plenty of other competitions that you can try again at.
Yeah Its priceless moment. Being a mother I can understand your feelings.
Each birth is special irrelevant of first or second. I am happy for you though
What are you doing now?
That is awesome good for you!
Are you serious
Does he still have your car
YEs it does take advantage of the time you have now
Reach out to them and see how they are!
Thats awesome. I love getting money as a gift.  Then you get to spend it how you want
Paying off debt is where i am now.  its hard work but so worth it
thats awesome i cant wait to have kids!
Oh no did you see who did it?
Darn I hope your insurance covers it
Thats unfortunate. What made you so scared of it?
There were no lights in the basement?
Im proud of you! I attend both Sunday and Wednesday nights each week
God is always there for you and always will be. 
Are you going to keep her?
Is she a brown doggy?
Thats great! What kind of project is it?
Making moneys always good! Do you think itll be a success?
it is frustrating to watch i agre
that is unfortunate hopefully you can give them guidance
were they your children?
I would be too. I would have complained to staff.
What kind do you have at the moment
Nice I love German Shephards! They are cute when puppies and monsters when they grow up my kind of dog
Good for you as an added bonus you are saving more money!
Cigarettes are very expensive depending on where you live
At least you finally got one! Sometimes it helps not to focus too much on what everyone has has or has done.
I get it everyone wants their first kiss like yesterday! Its a big moment!
Oh no do you have a digital backup?
Its ok you can always make new memories it will not replace what you have lost but it is a start
Thats pretty messed up. Why did you do that?
Are you going to tell her?
That is awesome what will you spend it on?
Good for you make sure you get the 20 down.
There is no right place to be for everyone. Each person has their own individual path
I think that we are free to do as we want and we are in control of our fate.
Oh really what happened?
Oh wow you mustve been pretty tired to make a mistake like that.
i have never seen it
i will check it out then!
Aw I really sorry to hear that. Is is serious?
Im sorry At least you can rest assured knowing that your cat lived a long life.
That really sucks that that happened to you. Maybe start by putting small amounts of trust in people
Ha sometimes the only person you can trust is yourself.
Nice what kind of project was it
Thats aweseome. Im happy it turned out well. You must be pretty artistic
That is the best feeling! I love getting a good deal on a great product.
Sounds like it was a nice surprise 
I know how you feel! Im about to be 30 and i feel so old lol
thats really great! you are such an optimist i need to learn from you 
What were they being eliminated from?
Were the singers any good?
waht type of game is x game?
ok so was it fun?
Im glad you had a nice trip. Was it your first.
I would have thought it would be the other way around.
Oh no! Did she miss school?
Well good thing she got there! Kids always tend to want to go to bed at the last minute and end up not sleeping enough or sleeping past their alarms!
Oh man Fight Club is a great movie! I just recently saw it myself and was really surprised too.
I agree that movie is definitely ahead of its time!
Thats cool.  Where at
Thats aweseome Ive always wanted to go to Cali...from the Midwest moved to TX to escape the desolate tundra haha
Do you like Mexican style foods?
Oh did you tell your boyfriend about it?
What kind are you looking for? I dont know about you but I hate car shopping!
I understand that. Gas is so expensive!
Oh where are you going? Is it a long trip?
Make a list and start packing for it a couple days in advance! 
oh no Im sorry to hear that. What happened?
Thats horrible. I am sorry for your loss. 
Did you help him to learn the swim techniques?
Thats pretty awesome...were you happy to see one or were you nervous
Oh man he must have been huge...did you get any pictures
Oh wow thats amazing! I workout as well.
I actually injured my back a while back as well. I havent gone to the doctor yet though!
Oh no Im sorry for your loss. Cats are such nice companions.
Yes time will help get over those feelings. Do you plan to get another one?
Oh man I know how you feel. How old was your bird?
That is horrible. Take some time and grieve. Im always here if you need someone to talk to.
That is awesome!  DO yo have to pay for Headstart?
Thats great.  My daughter is 3 so I hope I can get her into a program like that!
Thats cool. We saw it when it came out.
It was exciting.
What type of job do you have now?
Oh that is nice. Do you have a website for your business?
And what news would that be
best of luck friend
Oh wow! That would be so scary! What happened?
How far from shore were you?
Thats awesome congrats! Do you have a job lined up for when you finish?
Yes it will be nice to have a good pay cheque coming in.
Wow thats a pretty cool hobby. Just a small plane?
Yeah I always thought it would be fun to learn to do that. 
Haha Ive seen plenty do wheelies. Ive seen a few crash too sadly
That takes a lot of nerve so kudos to that guy. Id never do that because Id probably die lol
Thats great!  Dont be too nervous!  Your date is most likely just as nervous as you are!
Just try to have a fun time and let what happens happen!
Yeah theyre great. Super light and rigid.  They feel kind of springy when you ride them
Do you have clipless pedals on it?
Absolutely. It doesnt help that Im pretty introverted.
I hate when you help someone out and they take advantage of you. I could never do that to someone.
Why do you feel bad? It is a tough decision for sure but you should never have to feel bad about it.
I hear you on that but the way it is right now everything we do is destroying the environment and Im sure you do plenty already to help. Until electric vehicles are more affordable and reliable you cant blame yourself for the choice. Im sure your words have affected others and made them rethink their choices and all that helps and adds up.
Blessing are another reason to be grateful! 
How long were you married?
Thats really generous of her.  Shell grow up to have pretty good karma 
Yes.  I once helped out a friend in a car wreck.  A month later I got a flat tire changed for free
Oh man! Thats some Jerry Springer level drama. What happened? Did you tell him
Are they going to break up?
Oh man that must have been humiliating! Did people notice?
Oh man! Im sorry to hear that. Gotta be careful next time!
Congrats! How did you do it and where do you work?
My mom worked at a bank and its not as easy as youd think itd be thats for sure. Congratulations again!
Everything is harder until we do it. And am proud of you for donating blood. It is one of the good habit of this human race i would say.
yeah am B O is quite common and it can match for other blood group and Ove is the opposite
You met Johnny Dep? I have no idea what happened?
Wow thats pretty cool! Congrats! Thats a pretty exciting new thing in your life.
Do you think they just didnt want to pay for your retirement?
Are you a part of the union?
Wow thats cool...with hers or your credit card..?
Then shes a keeper for sure
Sounce like youre a bit of an introvert.
Yeah That gets old after a whle for me.    
Well thats awful. Did you ask him why he didnt pick you?
Yes I hope so too. its nice to get promotions at work.
You must be so happy! What kind of car?
Oh hell yeah! I bet youre so thankful to your parents. Enjoy your new car!
Oh thats cool.  Glad it worked out for her
Boy or girl?
Thats impressive but 45 mags are rare. are you sure it wasnt a 44 magnum?
Interesting.  It is a real bullet. 
Oh no! What happened?
Oh that is nasty! What did you do?
Congrats is your son very old or young?
Is he a sports player for the scholarships?
Holy crap! Did you see what it was?
Oh wow. Should have taken pictures of it and used the internet to help you figure out what it was! Id be curious.
Oh no did you get hurt very badly?
I hope both our ego and your nose heal up quickly!
Im sorry. That must be difficult. I am glad you have pictures to hold on to though.
Thats too bad you couldnt go but memories are great to have!
Oh nice! Hope you get it
Best of luck!
that is absolutely amazing! Im so proud of you! You should be very proud of yourself as well
Im a stay at home mom and honestly its the hardest job ive ever had but the most rewarding one  I told my husband i want to keep having kids so i wont have to work again lol
Was there a big name event going on? Ive seen the Blue Angles live 
oh no what happened whats the problem with the provider
Bad customer service. You should definitely switch
Sometimes that happens when you take a break from something for too long but with some practice you might be able to pick it back up again
if they are really your friends they wont care if you were bad
Absolutely! Ive always noticed that phenomena. If you act too desperate it actually puts them off. On the contrary acting a little disinterested gets THEM more interested.
I can agree with that. Women like a man who is dedicated to something. It shows good characer.
Thats cool.  Ill have to try those out sometime
Nice does it go well with any dip? Or is it better alone
Its always a great time when that happens.  My best friend and I moved away so I hadly ever see them now
It is it makes all those memories just flood back
Oh yes! Deja Vu has happened to me quite a bit! Its eerie and cool huh?
Its always intense running into exs. Im glad your guys conversation went well and you guys could catch up. 
He probably passed the infection to his mouth! Gross!
He needs to be quarantined whenever he gets some kind of sickness lol.
Oh awesome! Thats crazy because my 30th birthday is next week lol. What makes you excited? Because Im dreading mine.
Hahaha I guess thats true. For me its pretty bad. I dont know if youre familiar with the internet term but on my 30th birthday Im going to be a wizard lol.
Ive always wanted one of those! I hope you enjoy it.
Ive tried some of the cheaper virtual reality headsets but Im sure they cant compare at all!
That would make me so mad!  What did you do?
You should!  No one should have to clean up after someone elses animal.
Im glad you made changes for the positive in your life.  You cant go back into the past but you can keep moving forward
What kind of changes have you made and why did you decide to make them?
Why do you think youll get fired
Do you plan on discussing this with your boss? 
That would be so scary! Did it work on the first try?
I cant imagine. Are you planning on going parachuting again? 
Oh sweet I cant even  imagine the excitement you must have. I hope everything works out for you!
We need more musicians who are about the music and bringing enlightenment to people. We got way too much commercial garbage on the radio. I really hope your message resonates with people.
More than a couple of times.
Thats not bad at all.  
I would never go to that place again. Did you go to a different place?
thats horrible! Im sorry to hear that. if i was you i would write a bad review on this restaurants facebook page
i get you. i hate fighting but im not going to be disrespected either.
i totally understand that.
Hm I can relate to that haha
Im not always broke but I feel like what helps is leaving my credit  debit card at home and just carry cash for what I need
That must have been really annoying. Sucks to be a person whos on time dealing with people who dont care about being on time themselves.
Did you say anything after they arrived?
As long as it takes you from A to B and safe to drive thats all that matters I used to have 1995 camry and it looked old and beat up but it was the best car ive had
i feel like those type of cars are the most reliable! 
She spend all  youre retirement money? Thats pretty messed up.  Why did she do that?
Are you going to divorce her?
Are you going to the police?
Oh I hope you can find an alternative
Sounds like youll be alright after all
At least its better than having nothing to use
Im sorry. How long had you been together?
I hope you feel better soon.
oh no is she on computer too much?
you got a fair point. You would need to soften her with something else other wise childrens will keep aggravate you 
Ooh awesome! I bet everyones excited! I hope the future holds many more wonderful things for you!
Yea some people really prove that hard work can pay off. I hope he enjoys the promotion!
Have you gone on dates before?
It could be that but some of my friends have said that with social media and online dating its harder and harder to truly connect with someone. There are a lot of people out there struggling.
I still think you made the right choice by going.
True.. but who knows... maybe youll make a new friend.
I am so sorry. That is heartbreaking.
Itll take some time to grieve. Just make sure you have close friends and family nearby to talk to.
Whoa did it stink? Was it roadkill?
Haha man I bet that was fun. Poor skunk didnt know what hit him.
what is making you have second thoughts?
there are other options in life but you must always follow your heart when making such important decisions.
As we say around here you aint lying! How long were you waiting?
We have all been there! How hard would it be to put a few extra pens out? They gotta be worth like what a couple pennies a pop?
Wow! Did you thank your mom or buy her any gifts on your trip?
Dang! Can I get a hug too? 
Wow I bet that was nostalgic. Howd it feel seeing your old self doing fun stuff?
Haha yea although some people I know havent changed at all. I just miss the energy I had from when I was younger.
Thats great. You must be excited.    Have you played all the smash bros games?
Thats pretty cool. Ive never played it before What genre is it?
That sounds fun I might have to check it out.  It sounds pretty nostalgic.
I wont have a switch but I think that may be worth checking out.
I understand where you are coming from. Can you blame her for window shopping though?
Honestly we all do it. Plus who cares if she checks out other guys if she is coming home with you!
Thats awesome. you must be excited.  Ive been to cancun but not cozumel.
Youre not worried about the bad booze or kidnappings?
I would hate to live by myself. I have been married 21 years and have 6 kids and 7 grandkids. I dont know what its like to be alone.
Yeah my kids are almost all grown. I dont know what I will do when they are all gone. I guess I will just enjoy the grandkids and my husband. It will be different.
Oh gosh! Thats terrible. I stayed in a house with a rat problem for a while it was not fun. Whatre you going to do about them?
Woooow haha. Time for a game plan! I hope you can get rid of them you may need to call up some friends or an exterminator.
Yes all the time! That sounds like a nice dream. Do you still have a close relationship with your family?
Oh no Im sorry to hear that. I hope you can repair and issues you have between you guys. Theres nothing more important than family.
Oh my gosh thats terrifying! What kind of snake was it? And what did you do?
Thats awesome! I am truly impressed with your handling of the situation.
I have 3 do you have any
I dont think I could work in a daycare. It would be overwhelming.
Some people are just better at working with kids.
I like kids but I wouldnt want to work with them all day.
That is the worst. 
lol. All men do for that matter
Wow what a surprise!
Oh why is that?
it is indeed learning things at young age is a boon. you got an exceptional daughter
haha!! you are i guess!!
oh no. did you try to retrace your steps to find it?
oh that stinks. did you have phone insurance at least?
im so sorry. hopefully there is something they can do for you
its worth it so you dont have to be without a phone.
So it wasnt a kitten?
There were some burds fighting under my car once and I thought it was cats.
That sounds like fun! Its great to spend time with our children. Did you have fun?
Oh yes they can do that when they get older. My daughter is a teenager now so I can relate!
I bet it was! I have two kids but theyre pretty young. Im looking forward to seeing them achieve the same thing.
My son is going to the fourth grade and has been doing great so far. I hope he can keep it up!
oh man that is the worst! all that hard work ruined
i love eggs and cheese and would have been heartbroken. good thing pizza was available
I have never heard of that
oh cool. I never been to any kind of motorcycle event
I bet.  What grades are they in?
Are you excited for them?
Thats really frustrating. What band was it a tshirt for?
Oh I bet I could guess what kind of music theyd play. Sorry about your shirt problem though.
i used to go fishing with my grandpa a lot as a kid brings back awesome memories
i feel the exact same way. i havent fished in years for that same reason
Thats a good feeling
How many kids do you want?
Oh dang! Did you file for classes late?
Im so sorry to hear it! Were you able to take anything?
Thats my favorite part of facebook!  Especially when I see old pics of my kids.
About this time of year theres a lot of first day of school pics.
And in between football games and soccer games and christmases  its a healthy reminder that time flies so quickly!
I know Google Photos has a little reminder thingy where it says something like Remember this day?
Oh that is awesome! Im sure you do! Waiting for that can really feel like forever when its only been a few minutes!
Its good that you are excited! Im sure you will be a great asset for them!
Haha!  I am only laughing because I know exactly what you are talking about!  That has happened to me a couple times!.  I had to use a hand towel once!
Ha!  I wasnt thinking at the time.  I was just grabbing whatever was around!
Did you go with anyone?
Thats good! Relationships arent for everyone all the time. You have to love yourself before you can love someone else right?
Yes and you will end up meeting someone when youre not looking and n ot expecting it. 
Thats no good
i know that feelingh
Thats good. Your interview must have went really well.
Well I hope you get it then.
thats good.its very important to instill good learning and study habbits. something i wish i had as kid
sounds like she is ready to succeed 
That is good to hear. I am glad you did not overspend and go into debt.
I hope you can find another job soon.
I love self gifts. what was it
Really?Is it a good show? Ive never heard of it. 
Im the same way! Although now that I know it is scary I probably wont watch it!
Thats pretty sweet
What kind of cake?
That sounds about right. How old is she?
At 13 everything is interesting to her. She may just want attention.
I just got in a few months ago best of luck my friend!
I am in the Information Systems field
Yes! My husband and I bought the old school Nintendo and played a couple of months back.
They are I really enjoyed playing them. We also played Donkey Kong.
Why is that making you sad?
That is true well there is a lot of time left
I love playing Mario!
I havent played that one I will have to try it out.
Thats nice of you. Is it a special occasion?
Use a recipe and stick to it. If he is a good boyfriend he will appreciate your effort.
Oh my word! I wouls have just died
Where did it go?
Thats sweet! Family is so important and relationships with siblings is a very significant one in our lives. I felt the same about my sister.
We werent only 2 12 years. It was just the two of us and we were very close she passed away several years ago.
I do I used to play growing up.
I will have to try it out!
What field is that for? I am sure that is a lot of stress
That makes sense well I wish you the best of luck!
Well you cant do everything.
Give yourself a break. Your financial health is important too.
That is smart money is tight these days
That can be tough to do but will pay off in the long run!
Everyone has bad bosses. Just keep working hard and they will have to recognize your greatness.
Then maybe you should think about trying to find a job somewhere else?
What did you get?
Seriously? Do you like super smash bros? It is coming out in december I love my switch to death man it is amazing
I have been there I hope everything works out for you!
Thank goodness that will make you stressed.
Oh that is nice! What happened at the party?
Oh thats nice! Enjoy summer while it lasts. What did you go to college for?
Yeah that was awesome! I feel like they have a less than stellar track record when it comes to fan service.
I get where you are coming from. Nintendo fans are not easy to please!
I love the fair! Did you have a good time?
That sounds like a great time!
What is your field ?
We need you. Hang in there.
What are they for?
Ah okay that is good then I hope they are effective for you!
Oh most jobs dont unfortunately
Thats very unusual. Most jobs dont. I would talk to the managers about it! Paid lunch would be great
Well maybe the time in bed will help you relax
That must be quite dissapointing
That sounds really exciting? what was it?
Congratulations.  Thats awesome.  I hope you give him the world
Im sorry to hear that growing up can be tough.
That is hard especially being so far away from family.
Thats wonderful. I have two daughters 10 and 13. I wish you the best.
Youll do fine. As long as you love him everything else will work out.
I havent heard about the direct yet. What about it do you like?
That sounds exciting! I cant wait to what they come up with next!
I know that feeling.  I do phone support too.
Yep but you can only help one person at a time.
Oh that would not have been fun! They do not like people!
Are you going to say anything to your surperiors.
Oh well they probably do not need any ice cream!
Haha they can eat ice cream when they are the parents!
Aw hes still a little guy.
Cherish the moment while you can!
Oh no I hate to heart that. I hope everything is okay.
Something big must have happened.
Oh no did something happen to have caused it?
Im sorry to hear about what happened. Are you staying with your wife?
That is bad. What are you planning to do instead?
That is good also. Hanging out with friends is the best thing to do.
Thats great! I must have been so cool to see that!
Thats really great!
No way that is the worst. Did you ask your roommate why he or she ate it?
I am sorry to hear that! 
Is that the first day ?
Thats nice. Mine started a couple of weeks ago.
Thats a good thing. It can sometimes be overwhelming though
I know what you mean. We are getting club schedules together for my teen
You are very fortunate. Have you decided on a name yet?
You will know when the time is right. I am adopted myself so I have a special place in my heart for new parents.
That sounds fun!
Did you get a lot of gifts too?
Children are angels!
Yes that happens everytime!
Those games are usually so fun.
I will do that.
Congrats how fast did it go by?
Ugh I was hoping that is not the case I would want my kid to be young forever
I had to work when I turned 21. That must have been awesome
I went to the casino after and won 250 dollars but I was by myself lol
Sorry to hear that i hope you get chances to visit!
I enjoy football but I mainly enjoy that when football happens fall comes.
What do you do for work?
I am so thankful that I am able to stay home with my child.
It really is!
I am glad it did not make you depressed!
I am sorry to hear that I have been there before.
I think so thats the giant shark movie right ?
Ive never been much for sea stuff for some reason.
no its just not my thing. I like sci fi and horror...just not sea stuff
I know exactly what you mean
I hate that too. Especially when you are paying and they are right behind you... like why?
Does he at least work hard for it ?
Hopefully he  has worked hard for it. Im sorry you have to deal with that
I can imagine. 
You have a lot of hard work ahead.
Thats awesome. What kind of car.
That is a nice car! 
I am so sorry to hear that. I am glad you found people to count on.
Me neither how do you feel about it?
me too best of luck!
Thats really sweet. Is there any member of your family you are particularly close with?
Siblings can be our closest confidants and in a lot of cases lifelong friends.
do you like being home alone much?
yeah i can relate to that alone time is sometimes very relaxing
I bet. That is a special moment
What did you name him?
Thats so cute. I have a son named Ethan
That sounds fun did she have a good time?
That is even better! School shopping can be so expensive.
Uh oh are you ready for the Terrible 2s?
He will be into everything. I know what you mean about looking back. Kids grow so fast.
Oh no I am so sorry! I hope you find him.
Im sure he will return!
I was told that recently. My ilfe revolves around my kids
I know exactly whaat youre saying
Well thats fun!  Did he do a good job?
Cool Im glad it was a success.  I hope it reminded you of good times!
did you like that? i find reusing dresses very combinient
that is really nice i still have my wedding dress
Thats so nice!
Hey children are a miricle. 
Thats nice. What sort of work do you do?
Great how about a loan ? Just kidding.
wow it sounds like a very exotic holiday
Ok but at least you got to do something you have always wanted right? visit gulf shores
I hate how itchy you get after being bitten.
The bites take forever to go away too!
Its a difficult fact of life
I think thats normal! Eventually you will adjust
Cant you just get another one?
Maybe you can just get another job.
Oh no you should probably deal with the consequences
Dont worry too much about it worrying can actually make you preform worse. You can always retake the test!
You got it!
Wow then you know how it feels. I hope you do great.
I bet you wont have anything to worry about. We will both excel.
Oh no! Ive never seen that movie but it sounds like it was very horrifying! Have you watched it as an adult?
Well at least you were able to conquer your fear!
Wow that is sleazy what did you do?
I do not know how did you discover that was the case?
that is sad i wish you and your family the best of wishes
that is normal when you lose someone but time heals everything
That is gross what kind of food?
That is nasty you have to kill that habit!
Thats great we all deserve to feel peace and happiness with how our lives are going.
Youre a kind person to wish that.
Oh no! I hope you didnt feel too humiliated.
That something which you should be proud of.
I hate interest too. It is always to pay cash.
If you were given the project its probably because someone thinks you can do it!
Its a very good feeling when someone has faith in you! Good luck with your project!
You should get the same sneakers then.
Just save up and eventually you will be able to get them.
Were you scared? Hope it wasnt a mean dog.
Good idea. Glad you got away safely.
Oh good luck! Are you nervous for the job interview?
Its so great to be prepared! Im sure the interviewers will be impressed!
Sounds like youre ready to ride out the storm. Are you afraid?
True. I bet it was a mad house at the supermarket today.
That is so nerve racking. Im sure you will do great.
Do you usually do good in math? It is my favorite subject and always came so easy for me.
Yeah that can be a tough time. Pretty soon hell be off to college!
Well I am sure he will meet a bunch of jolly good fellows while hes still in high school. You just got to keep on top of him with his grades and he will be fine.
Hey Im looking forward to it too! Cant wait to crush my coworkers.
I play on the PS4. Its the only way to play Madden.
what book you reading?
lol i feel you i too am lacking in that department
That is too bad. How did they get hurt?
Ouch. I hope he didnt lose any teeth.
Why did you think he was after you?
Although you might have really been scared your story sound kind of funny!
Oh lucky you! Whats his or her name? 
Thats so wonderful. My boyfriend has a cat named Smoke I call him Smok that I love sooo much. Good luck!
Yeah that feature is pretty nifty. Makes it so you dont have to keep hardcopy photo albums anymore! 
I feel you man. Seeing pictures of my baby son tears me right up.
Thats really nice of her!  Was there a special occasion or anything?
Dang kind of reminds me I should probably do something nice for my wife...
Thats unfortunate. What type of exam do you have?
How ironic. Unable to study finances because youre at work making your own.
Oh no whats up?
The anticipation must be crazy.
Nice! What kind of cake was it?
Those cakes are really good! I believe they are made of dried milk.
Was it planned?
Thats terrible. Did they give you a reason?
Wow what a lucky day for you!
Pizza is my absolute favorite I could eat it for the rest of my life.
aw looks isnt everything.
Wow. Ive gotta see this guy then.
How unprofessional of your professor to say that! What was your project over?
Silver lining she said she didnt want to fail you so at least you passed your project.
Atleast you gave something its the thought that counts right.
As long as she knows where your intentions are the amount doesnt matter we all wish we can do more but we do what we can dont be down.
Oh man I bet you didnt sleep for weeks!
No it wasnt. I bet you learned your lesson not to steal pretty quickly.
Thats so cool! What did you think about that?
Very interesting. Maybe I should look into that to connect to my great grandmother.
How did you cheat?
Hopefully you pass at least.
Oh dang. Did anyone come eventually?
Well at least you werent left there for all eternity.
Reminiscing on memories how old was you are yall still together?
So young lol well at least its a good memory and the good weather makes you happy and think about it. 
They usually are. Whos wedding did you go to?
Of course! Im sure he appreciated you being there!
I hate it when that happens. You should get a lock for the fridge.
Some people just have no consideration. You deserve to eat your leftover Chinese.
i bet your excited wish i was you
good for you send me a post card enjoy
Well thats nice of you. Did he give you anything in return?
Wow. I wonder how they even saw that the grass needed to be cut living in darkness.
Well at least heshe feels better now? Sorry about your shoes.
Wow. I didnt know shoes could cost that much!
Wow thats quite the career leap! What made you do it?
That makes sense to me. Money doesnt always equate to happiness. Hope you are doing better now!
Aw Im sorry. Losing a pet is very hard. I recently lost a cat. It hurts.
Thank you. Yes even though its been a month since we said goodbye I still look for him around the house. 
Oh wow! Are you afraid of heights at all?
Thats great! Maybe I should conquer my fear of heights that way too!
Wow thats incredible! Good for him.
I think so too he knows what its like to be down and out and to work hard for his own success.
Im sorry to hear about that. What are the risks if you were to go through with it?
That is definitely risky. Is the alternative of staying sick better?
Thats awesome! Math is pretty tough.
Glad all that studying worked out!
Aw I am sorry to hear that. Are things better now between the two of you?
Distance is sometimes the best healer. Glad to hear things are patched up.
Oh no  did you take him to the vet? what kind of dog is it?
Those are such smart dogs! I hope its nothing
That can be scary! Do you feel prepared?
Youll be okay! Use the age old public speaking advice picture everyone in their underwear! Good luck!
I hope it turns out well!
It must be such a relief. Im happy for ya.
Nice! How did it turn out?
I am sure she will like it as long as you followed the recipe.
Thats awesome! Good luck to ya.
Are you a math major?
Thats an interesting combination. Did you make it up off the top of your head?
I like how creative you got with it Ill need to try it sometime.
New jobs nerves is pretty normal. Get a good rest!
Oh man that nervous hu?
Dang that sucks. Do you have an insurance policy on it?
Nice. At least you wont lose any money.
Thats adorable! What was the word?
Oh my. That is quite a unique first word!
Yeah it can be tough. Especially if youre in a heated argument.
I know right?!? Sometimes its just best to be quiet even though you know you are right to help things get better.
I know how you feel! I dont have carpet in my living room for that reason Sometimes they have accidents. I hate poo accidents especially!
Oh yes best to have her not alone ever during this time.
Was it yours or the banks fault?
If it was the banks mistake even if you didnt have enough money theyre responsible for fixing it.
Thats perfection. I rescue animals as well.and have many more cats then that lol. It is very needed to help cats
Me too! Its very hard sometimes like running an orphanage but it is rewarding as well!
How old is it? Did you guys play on it a lot together?
Thats cool I dont know the first thing about building my own pc.
Did heshe say something you may disagree with?
That sounds unprofessional. I thought they were supposed to sound neutral.
I didnt know such a thing existed! What store?
Oh! Thats a nice program. Well getting any amount of groceries for free is nice but yes too bad it wasnt a supermarket sweep
Im sorry to hear that. Is something wrong?
LIttle things build up sometimes. I hope you feel better as well.
Was it Dominos pizza?
Because I love Dominos so thats the only pizza I think of!
Oh who was there?!
Oh sweet. Hows the new phone?
That would really annoy me! Did you end up taking any action against them? I know some companies will tow a vehicle that does that.
Man the nerve on some people. I would never take somebodys spot if they have a sign up for it!
What a glutton. Did he happen to have a mountain of crab legs?
Man I feel bad for his stomach. Its probably as worn out and bloated as my great granddad.
50?  That might be a world record or something.  How did you find out?
I guess he learned his lesson.  Only eat 25.  ha ha.
I agree I loved that show so much when I was little.
I agree whats your favorite?
Mental illness is very tough to deal with it by themselves.
Who are the caregivers? Hisher parents? Or Children?
Are you in trouble?
Well they can be but make sure you buy it next time. Ramen is super cheap 
That must have been very nostalgic
Kids grow up so fast. Gotta cherish every moment sometimes.
That is tough.  How is she doing?
That is terrible.  Has she cut off all contact with them?
That sucks. And you guys studied the same amount?
How do you feel?
Thats great! Hopefully the meeting goes well.
Pet alligator! Why do you have him as a pet is he a rescue?
Well Im not sure about that or how are you typing?! 
Oh yeah? What did your dog do?
Awwwww thats so cool. I remember when my dog was going through all that over a year ago. They learn so fast.
Nice! What is he working on?
Im sure he wont. Sounds like hes a hard worker.
Oh wow. I wonder what that kind of bite feels like. Did it hurt?
Right have to train them not to I suppose if at all possible.
That is good. When do you have the exam?
Dang. Why dont you just get your own?
Thats reasonable. Just make sure you get your own when you have the funds available.
That sounds like a lot of fun. What do you do now?
Oh so sorry to hear that. Well maybe you can round them up for something.
I completely agree!  I am all about keeping the earth clean recycling and low waste living.  They should get bigger fines!
Im right with you.  Oh cigarette butts gross me out not to mention second hand smoke which has been found to cause cancer too.
Oh god. Does that store have sanitizing wipes?
Some people just arent considerate of others like that.
Do you normally do makeovers?
Wow that would be so cool! I dont do makeup good on others. Did you do anything with her hair?
Thats wonderful. What was it?
Thats so cute!
Nice! Is she happy about it?
Thats too bad. Maybe she can come with you?
That sounds about right for the bus station unfortunately. How did everyone react when they saw it?
Wow. I hope you dont ever have to see anything like that again!
Haha I wouldnt worry about it. There is much worse things you can do. Unless youre doing something you shouldnt be doing online!
Yeah well maybe you can offer to pay for half of it instead?
Thats terrible! Did you say anything about it?
Yeah I would be too. Hopefully theyll invite you in the future.
Oh no is it a young dog or an older one?
Right puppies are like that. It took mine a year and a half before they werent having any more accidents like that.
Its really nice that you feel that way even though you wanted it. Think youll get it next time?
Well it certainly sounds like you deserve it. You sound like a good person.
Thats awesome. Debt really is an awful thing.
Glad all that hard work paid off for ya. I aspire to get there someday myself.
Oh wow thats great.  What unit are you in now and what made you want to change?
Thats awesome.  Are you a nurse?  I used to work in the NICU.  It was a wonderful job.  Good luck with your new position.
Wow! That is pretty amazing IMO..unless she isnt good with kids..My first almost killed me..and I am terrified to do it again..
Aw well as long as she is a good mom more power too her  Children are great fun.
Oh no. Whats going on?
Im sorry to hear that. Are you thinking about changing your diet and exercise routine?
Did you at least study?
Nice. How long did that take you to learn?
Thats really great. You should go join the circus.
Mustve been a good burp.
Mustve gave them a good chuckle. Dont worry. Theyll get over it.
Oh man. Was she mad?
Dang. Well I am sure you wont make that mistake in the future!
I bet.  I love fast food soooo much.  What did you have?
It really does.  I feel your pain on the no wheat policy.  I used to eat fast food all of the time and now I am a no wheat no oil vegan so No fast food.
Im not celiac but I just eat whole food plant based.  It has been hard for me because I also hate vegetables not good for a vegan but I drink a lot of fresh vegetable juices and whole food smoothies to get the nutrients in.  I feel so much better now though that I cant go back.  Check out the Happy Pear on youtube they have great vegan recipes.
I am very sorry to hear all of that it is a little more expensive but I found I feel so much better I can actually work more o make up the difference.  Check out Dr. Michael Greger too if you havent he is a great resource as well.
Oh no!! When did this happen?
Oh I feel you! I used to be a food addict as well when I was younger. It is a hard habit to break! Its amazing how far you have come though! So many dont realize that fresh real food make a difference and you feel so good when you get real nutrition!
Thats too bad! Do you know if you can buy a new one before the show?
Yea maybe you can find an alternative. I lost a few shirts over the years before too its no fun.
I wouldnt be able to keep a surprise like that!
Sounds like youre ready to go!
Wow thats quite the shift! Did you have any difficulties leaving things behind you?
Best of luck to you I hope everything works out great in the end!
Was the dog upset about something or was heshe just telling you whose boss?
She probably bad mouthed you while out there.
Thats too bad. Maybe she will find a new one soon.
Thats always a plus. I am sure that will make the search less stressful.
Thats why I dont have carpeting.
Thats really nice! Did you guys reconnect?
Its always great to reconnect to old friends.
Fear when you are a child can be so gripping.  What were you afraid of?
That is really terrifying.
That is really mean. Why does she do it?
I would too if my wife did that. Its alright man.
Thats unfortunate! What style food did your favorite restaurant serve?
Dim sum huh? I havent heard of that before. What exactly is that?
Where did you take her?
What did she eat on your date?
Im sorry to hear that. Are you saving more?
Yea. You should definitely hold off on buying a new car for now.
Oh my god!! she must have been raised in a barn!
Like a bathroom maybe!  some people really just dont understand manners.
Haha thats funny you mention that. I seen the same thing happen to a girl when I was at the grocery story one time.
Yeah it must be a pretty embarrassing moment. Although its an honest mistake.  
You have one as a pet?
Thats great losing a pet would have been awful.
Yeah I sometimes do that as well. But as long as the bills are getting paid I guess you cant complain.
True. But you cant help stupid people from getting high paying jobs. I am a prime example.
Is the first time that he ran away?
Then it is a little bit scary. Did you try to find him?
That sounds awesome! Have you guys been friends long?
Thats pretty cool. You guys must have a good relationship. 
I wish you luck anyway!
Thats disgusting! Why are cats so rude?
I hope that that was the last time you have to clean up any messes! Sending my prayers!
I would like to come there and see it how are you doing it?
I havent actually. Have you?
Ive heard good things about the Navy and also how tough it is.
Thats awesome! Good luck on your finals!
Dont forget to get some rest though.
Nice! What kind of food do they serve?
That sounds incredibly tasty. I think I will have to go there.
Thats so kind of you!
aw Im so happy for it. Do you miss it?
Wow thats pretty nice of her. I wish my girlfriend would cook for me!
Yes she certainly does! I guess she makes up for it in other ways!
They sound great! Happy birthday to you!
I think thats normal. What were you afraid of?
Mustve been really terrifying. What did your parents do?
That is so sad. What happened to her mom?
That is really said. I hope that she gets a new mom some day.
I am sure you did fine. Did you study hard?
It will be fine! Youll be staring at an A before you know it!
Oh my that does sound really relaxing. The weather was nice?
Thats great. Im glad you got to feel that feeling.
That is no fun! I have been feeling lonely lately too Where are your frineds?
That is lame! what was their excuse?
Oh no! Does she have any applications outstanding?
True. Sometimes you have to lower your standards to something more realistic.
Thats kinda sad. Is he studying or something?
Yeah pushing herself could end up to her having a horrible life.
I wouldve been angry.
Thats funny and also kind of a waste of pizza.
They sound very helpful and caring! Would you take their classes again?
Awesome! That makes me glad that there are still teachers and professors that truly care!
I hope it turns out well whatever it is.
She is a saint!
I dont know how anyone could turn an abused child away..its not easy but they need help.
Whoa thats terrible. Did the police catch the robber?
Yes I would be too. I hope you catch them and I hope he didnt loose too much stuff.
Thats a strong relationship  im happy to hear people like you still exist in this world
thats disgusting  then why even be in a relationship waisting someones time
Nice! Was it tasty?
I love having that feeling. Especially after eating a healthy snack!
Oh lord I bet! Do you start early and what is it?
Thats comical. Most of us dont reach 90.
That happened to someone else today too! That is a bummer but is she just a puppy?
That is good. You are better then me..I rescue but I would hate having that on something new.
Thats kinda creepy. What do you think happened to him?
Hmmmm...Maybe he just went on vacation?
Wow. Where ya going?
I dont think the polar bears are gonna let you near their coke man.
Thats really neat. What kind of dance was it?
Wow sounds pretty impressive!
How long ago was this?
where did they go
oh .. do they visit often? 
Your car door?
Was it parked at home? That sucks
was it tax free weekend?
ah.. that sounds like a smart move.
Wow really? Thats interesting. And yet he still teaches? 
I guess he really does do it for the passion of teaching then.
Thats good to hear. Whats going on?
Its good to reunite with them again hu?
Thats pretty awesome. Do you usually run marathons?
Glad your hard work paid off. Was this marathon for a good cause?
Thats a really good idea smart thinking! 
Well hopefully nothing bad will happen and you wont need to use it.
Oh no do you know what caused it?
Oh god. Im guessing they didnt take responsibility?
oh wow.. do you think they can handle it?
thats a good idea then if she can manage it 
Sorry to hear that! Losing pets is tough its essentially losing a family member.
I hope you find the peace that you deserve and know your pet loved you!
Wow! That is awesome!
Will he be in school this year?
That is nice. How old is she?
That is awesome.
Oh pity. Speak with them daily.
Im away from my family for the past 10 years.
Thats good to hear. Have they been there for you in the past?
Thats so kind of them. Im glad youre repaying their kindness.
were you able to make it up?
oh good luck!
What. Are they still viable?
Will you get a refund?
I hope you did a really great job.
Thats all you can do at this point 
That was so nice of her! What kind of food?
Wow thats impressive. A very exotic dish for sure!
Tennis? I am terrible at that game
Well if you were playing me you would definitely win
That sounds like fun. Do you not go out with them anymore?
Hey being single isnt that bad! Youll find your soulmate one day when the time is right.
i would feel the exact same way  how come it did not work ?
that is a little aggravating  i would be pissed too 
it is a great time of the year
Ooh cool what are you gonna do while theyre away? 
Nice sounds like a relaxing weekend.
Sorry to hear that. What were you upset about?
A C is not too bad. I know how you feel I hold myself to a very high standard as well. It could have been much worse though!
Oh no thats so dangerous. Are you okay?
Yes I would be too. That was so irresponsible of them!
Thats very nice of you. I hope you guys have a great time!
Im sure it will go well! What are you cooking?
Sorry to hear that. Sounds like sleep for you might not be in the cards tonight?
Im hoping for a miracle for you so that you can get a little bit of shut eye!
That is nice. Do you take them frequently?
That is a good surprised.
Oh no! I hate to hear that! Have you found another place yet?
Well I think youll be able to sell it for a good price.
its funny what one saves  i saved a mickey mouse that was given to me while i was in the hospital things like 20 years old lol
good times  you got to hold on to the memories 
Thats why they are being replaced by machines lol
I thought I had seen every episode of lock down. I havent seen that lol
Oh no! I hope shes ok. Have you taken her to the vet?
I hope she does too. Maybe spend extra time loving on her tonight she shell feel better.
I hope so too. Stay inside just in case.
I hate lightning. It makes me jump every time.
Wont you visit?4
Oh man that always leads to trouble for me lol
They probably changed their crust or something they always do that mess.
I know right. I was never truly explained the world of bills
me too  but i had a long day at work and right now im just relaxing in the cold air for a little bit longer 
that sounds like a great plan honestly 
Thats wonderful. It always feels good to pay off debt I think.
Yes you must be very proud for accomplishing that.
Whats goin on?
That should be fun. I have to work this weekend. I need to hang with friends before I go crazy
Bedtimes can be really hard for the kids and the adults too. LOL
Oh no I have to take her side now. Summers are made to break the rules.
The place didnt fall apart did it?
Well that has never happened to me. I never think about work when Im not there lol
yeah thats annoying  its happened to me before
i used rope from the warehouse once as a belt 
Thats how it works for most of us lol
If only they had told us sooner.
Did you usually visit them?
Thats cool! Are you gonna go all out with decorations and things?
Are you nervous? Im sure theyre gonna love you.
Then throw the whole dude away and get you a new one! You deserve the best!
That is a real bummer. I hope you got a security deposit. They wont be getting that back.
Make sure to leave feedback on their profile. Hopefully they cant get any more rentals.
I am sure nothing will happen to you.
I understand. Sometime I become also superstitious.
Did you flip out?
Thats true. Were the questions even important?
From you drinking it or someone taking it?
I think its time to hide your drinks from them. It works. That is what my Mom did when I was a kid.
Are you concerned about aomething?
Think positively. Stressing yourself out can definitely cause a problem
Thats always fun the kids always love it so much
Probably so but theyll remember it in the future and have fond memories.
Oh no! Are you okay? 
Its okay everyone makes mistakes sometimes. I hope the other driver is okay.
Oh no about what?
Oh no Ive been there done that too many times.
You wont believe how many times that has happened to me
that is really fun to do waht did you buy?
i really like going once a month to buy something i really want helps with my anxiety
Oh no! I can only imagine how that would have felt! How old was it?
Aww thats so sad! But its good to know she will be remembered
Yay! I am excited for you  Have you known her long?
HAHA I see I see  Thats good! I hope it goes well and you fall in love
dont we all 
Seems one would know where that kept such precious things
I never got into the pokemon craze
Well that will be fun for you guys!
Oh no I hate to hear that. Did he have a good reason?
I have been thinking about it too. ITs hard out here
I know right. Especially for women.
Awe I love weddings! Were they having a big wedding or a small one?
You will when the time is right and itll be beautiful.
I love it when I something takes you back to yesterday. Its just so nostalgic and that can be a great feeling.
So true. Whenever it happens I just close my eyes and embrace it.
that does sound terrible
I dont know if I should laugh or cry or both on the one lol
Im sorry I didnt mean to be rude. Hopefully his demise showed someone out there that drinking is bad and made them change their life.
Alright! is that a big money promotion for them?
Thats great! did yall go out and celebrate?
Did you cry?
Well it looks like you survived!
Do you mean that literally or are you just ready to move?
Dont give up. I know it can be discouraging when your trying so hard. But it will happen.
Im not sure if thats good or bad.
I am so afraid of coasters.
That is very unlikely. Thats what they say.
Would you believe I have never seen one episode of that show? How sad that its ending before I even got to watch it!
Well dont tell me what happens I might just go watch it all now lol
stuff like that makes me wonder if they had been talking to each other the whole time
i feel you  but you will find someone better and he downgraded lol
Ive never seen that but I love a good tear jerker!
Ill have to check it out this weekend. Anything about the holocaust makes me cry.
Thats a smart move! Good thinking!
Thats so nice of you to help them out! Im sure theyre really thankful.
Where are their parents?
Call the police. I would. 
Well. hope you score high.
Yeah It is!
Oh really? And why is that?
Wow any reason for that?
I hate that feeling. Are you still feeling that way now?
Well Im glad you found your friends thats a terrible way to feel. Ive been there before.
That was a crappy thing to do. Better get a handle on it now or it could become a big problem.
They probably deserve it but you know the old saying two wrongs dont make a right.
OH no. Is that a good thing?
My daughter will be 14 this year. You just made me feel old lol
Oh man honey buns are the best snack cake ever!
Im the same way. Ill eat them in the car on the way home sometimes lol
Wow nice! Congratulations that. You must have worked hard.
I hope it was all worth it for this moment. Good job!
Thats sad are you throwing them a going away party?
Well Im sure theyll like that and I bet theyre gonna miss you too.
Who chose the place?
Cool. I love italian. Real italian.
Thats because you worked hard and never gave up! Im proud of you!
One day youll be able to. Just keep your head up!
Someone was recording him from the shadows
I wish I could do one
They make me sad too. I wish I could heal all those sick kids.
It makes me feel better knowing that they get such great care at St Judes and the parents never get a bill though.
You must have been terrified. Did you see it happen?
That is so awful. Was he a the victim of a crime or was it some type of accident?
I would have been so scared. What did you do?
Did you ever find out who he was?
Oh ok I hope you are enjoying it. Why only one receiver?
Well that was a good choice then! It will save you some money too im sure
Its about time then. Maybe now you will be able to get the back payments too.
Its hard to depend on it. Dont figure it into your billing. That way if he doesnt pay it cant hurt you.
I could never do that.
You couldnt stay at work until the next day. My job requires security to walk females out when its late.
wow You didnt want to be around them that bad?
LOLOL thats actually hilarious  I guess thats why its ex now lol
uh. maybe its not something that important
OH. I get it. Thats good then
Those are so much fun. Family or school?
That will be great. Take lots of pictures you will want to remember all of those memories you are going to make.
Yep. That always happens
I only wear shorts!
I would try and just wear shorts!
On christmas morning I got everything I wanted.
All of them?
In your jeans you did?
Well thats cute
Join the club
I have never seen a movie before
I wish one day i could see it.
thats good  I think all children need that.  I did when I was a child!
Haha! that is no good you must have gotten no sleep.
Why didnt you drink water?
RC Cola lol. I havent had that is years
That is terrible have you told him how bad that will be?
Maybe you should get married!
Well that terrible
I always wear shorts everywhere.
Thats the way to go about it!
Did they get your shorts too?
Call the police
That was sweet. Did you eat together?
She sounds like a keeper
How do you feel about that? Are you ready?
Oh I see. Speeches always make me a bit nervous too... but once you start it gets less worrisome I think.
is there still a chance to get any??
oh my gosh  kids refuse to sleep i feel like i kind of do that as an adult too though
Well thats a positive spin
Food solves lots of things lol
I wish i had kids.
I think they would make my life worth living.
I dont like them either
Lol okay then!
I went to college for a few years.
I did not like college much
I thik thats good
Why do want to fight?
Yes! that can be once of the best times of the week.
yes! are you going to a fancy restaurant ??
Packing lunch saves money
Ipack my kids luch
that is not a good thing to wake up to hahah
yeah i can relate to your anger i have kids myself and have expiriencee similar situation but after you will remmeber and laugh together
Yes! I always regret when I impulse quit a job.
Yes! was he a bad boss?
I know that feeling. Stressing doesnt make it any easier though
 I hate snakes!
I stay far away!
I feel as if dogs think humans are the most comfortable bed!
Yes! cuddling is I feel an instinctual joy!
Ugh gross! I have to say I have seen worse in food before!
Yes Im constantly thinking about whats in my food!
Blind dates can be so nerve wrecking! How did it turn out?
Youll improve what you need to Im sure. At least the experience was worthwhile.
I know right! they keep going up in my area its crazy!
That would be amazing! You could skip alot of traffic
I keep all my photos online.
I can not even imagine how that would be.
Good for him. What sport do they play and was it any of that state level competitions?
Seems promising. What position does he play?
WOW I would be quite upset  Atleast let me know before you do that!
wow Thats unbelievable.  Did you let her know it upset you?
oh man thats actually hilarious I hope he was a baby...?
yeah thats pretty scary and gross! 
Yes! where did you go? do you feel relaxed?
Yes! I bet it was great probably really nice weather. 
Pay you for what?
You can sue!
Every summer for me is too hot to go outside.
I would have left right now!
how am i supposed to know?
I also go to sleep during movies.
We can sleep when all of the movies come on together!
How was your drive? were you driving fast??
Wow he was high on alcohol! I hope he didnt hurt anybody.
are you scared of them or why do you run from them?
i enjoy a little rain every once in a while but i dont like thunderstorms either 
Oh did you check what could be that?
Do you believe in ghost? 
Whats wrong?! is he not obeying your rules?
That is not good  He need to learn he has to respect you.
That is great. What game was it?
Did you get a trophy?
Oh my god Are you doing okay? What hapened?
Oh my god.  I hate when people are so careless.
That would have to stop immediately or that shovel might be used for something else.
If he wont stop you may need to take a picture of him doing it and then contact the authorities.
Yes Life moves so fast its truly hard to believe some times.
I couldnt agree more  Sometimes It feels like I was a little kid just yesterday.
I know what you mean I dont even bother at this point.
Exactly the same for me. Dont let it bother you too much.
Awe that is sweet was it a special occasion?
That is good! just a reminder that you have a father that loves you.
Yes! That is the worst I feel like my time is being wasted.
I say just keep putting yourself out there cant give up.
What was the big day then?
Oh cool I hope it goes well!
thats pretty cool
wow thats crazy
I would say that is one of life simple joys not a care in the world.
I try to do that as often as I possibly can.
that is not cool what where you guys planning to do
if he had other things to do it is ok but i hate when people  cancel just beacuse they are sleeping haha
I have no friend at all.
Maybe try a bar with food!
What did you do with the money?
What was it? Was it clothing?
Yes! life is a blessing and we need to make the most of every day.
God is good to people.  He is always there for you.
I would have thrown up!
I would have left the entire house!
Did you take any medicine?
They want you to take their medicines?
Maybe try and watch tv or play games.
Maybe go outside and try and eat dirt.
I guess because they are healthy and dont taste that bad.
Really? Must be some bad peas.
Maybe they found a lover to share life with.
That changes everyones life.
Its a good feeling when you are successful after you have worked so hard. 
The way you felt should be motivation to keep up the good work.
oh really i bet i would be too
that is the most beautiful thing ive ever heard
that is a great plan!
I would cry if anyone i know died.
That actually sounds super sad.
That must of been scary.
Where are you staying right now?
I am also looking for a better job.
I mow lawns for a living and it is so hot.
Im sorry to hear that. What will you do now?
Like in Community! Youll have a great time and Im sure everything will work out well.
I prefer New York style pizza.
That is not cool of them did they have a good reason?
well anyways it is really bad on their part that they did that
Did you get them to recook it?
i agree.they are not taking my guns!
oh yea? whats that.
oh thats nice wish i was doing something similar
Oh I hate it when that happens!
I tend to get road rage and lay on my horn at times like those.
Yeah? Why was that?
Good. I loved school too.
I wish i was one of those people.
If i could make more money for less work i would any day.
Oh no! How fast were you going?
Harsh. How much is the fine?
That is great news. How did the interview go?
Who is the interview with?
oh wow that is horrible im sorry for your loss
wow thats young
Are you in college or high school?
What was your last job then?
Sounds like an interesting job. I hope you get that job that youre looking for.
Was it with close friends?
And nothing bad happened?
Thats a good plan. Did the snow and ice come?
Like the Boy Scouts  Always Be Prepared.
There is not enough money to get me to do that. My sister likes those kind of shows and I watch with her sometimes.
OMG! Were you grossed out?
Oh thats terrible. Was he busy with something else?
Ah I see. Must have slipped his mind while he was hard at work.
Do you know who did it?
have you thought  about saving money?
Yeah it is hard for some people to save money for me it is kind of hard not to spend what i have
I honestly hope they do not.
Im more of a football fan!
That must of been embarrassing.
wow that is crazy? did he?
good thing it ended well
Wow! I dont know much about baseball but I know Babe Ruth. New York Yankees wasnt he? The house that Ruth built.
Im sure hell love that. It must be quite valuable.
Wow that is really tall.
Are you done growing?
I am not sure what that is but I wish you luck with it.
That is actually nice i like rock music.
Amazing! Were you close when you were young?
Im glad you got back in touch then. 
I see. How was the show?
It sounds like an important film. I love watching documentaries.
What kind of pen are you talking about?
What do you write with it? Do you write a letter or a book or a shopping list?
I am not American so I am only vaguely aware of them.  They are an American new channel is that right?
What a lovely aunt. You must be her favorite nephew or niece
Maybe she tried to bring some warm strings in relationship with you
Oh no. It happened to me recently. But I take the4 view that things like that happen for a good reason and youll end up in a better position down the line.
I am in exactly the same boat. Im still searching for a new job. Its tough. But stay positive  it might not happen!
Thats so funny! I mean that must have been embarasing!
Such a shame. Were you very young?
I love pizza. Did you make it by yourself or with friends?
Were you the only one who are it?
Who is he that you are speaking about?
Do you want your friend to change?
Im in the UK  when is Labor day? 
Wow! Thatll be amazing!
That is a good thing. How long have you been with them?
That is a long time. Why not get married?
Will you not be sad to leave him?
Thats a good way to be.
wow. i would also fee sad
Oh thats exciting! When are they coming?
Thats excellent! I bet you two will have an amazing time!
What are you making for the dinner?
Will you make any dessert?
Really? Lots of people seem to disagree with that
Good  Im sure he will be good for the business side of things.
Was it delivered by Fed Ex UPS or by the US Postal?
I have never heard of them. What was in the parcel?
Oh no! Why not?
Can it not be rearranged?
Who is your favorite team?
Oh me too. Social cues seem to get lost so easily on people these days.
My pleasure. It needs to be said. 
i love the becah im there every weekend
i live like 10 min away
Really? that is crazy
I cant imagine that
5 eh? Good  thats my favourite number!
Why did you get angry?
That isnt good. Did you speak to a manager?
Sorry  I mashed the keyboard. When is the UFC on?
any special plans?
ive always wanted to go on a cruise
How old was sammy?
I am sure you had good times. Will you get another dog?
wow they must be really tasty for you to have done that
You will be fine buddy. Type therapy for stoping cookie addiction on youtube I am sure you will find something helpful there
Great! Why are you so happy today?
Brilliant! SO the summer starts now for you?
Wow! I hope so. Are you going to ask them today?
Good plan. Why are you so confident?
Why were you not allowed to go?
Did you return the item?
How long will that take to happen?
do you have a special plan?
im sure he will love it!!!1
Were you expecting the parcel?
What was inside the parcel?
Really? Why? Out of happiness?
Good point. But maybe just maybe itll be brilliant.
Thats a great attitude to have.
It sounds like you are very content. Thats great!
Yeah  what kind of work do you do?
Good  it makes a big difference if you can enjoy your work.
OH no! Im sorry to hear that. Are you alright?
Have you got plenty of people around to support you?
why was that? what hppened
ohhh..sounds super awkward
Well done! Did you buy all the parts separately?
Did you find it difficult?
Yeah  Ive done it a few times and its much easier than most people think. Still impressive though
Make sure you dress nicely and bring a positive attitude.  
Yeah no problem.  Make sure to do a mock interview with a friend or family member to practice what you will say.
Is this your first job?
Whats wrong with the job you have now since you have been there for 21 years?  Must not be too bad.
what were you expecting
hahah...thats too funny
Oh no. Disgusting! 
Thats a funny image. 
What kind of cookies?
Were they as delicious as they sound?
Were they chocolate covered cookies or chocolate flavored?
Man Im starting to get a little hungry.
Wow. Were you hungry or just feeling like a treat?
They must have been delicious cookies!
thats really cool!what did she compete in?
wow! 17 catagories!! thatis a lot!
When is it?
How old is he then  3?
Oh my that doesnt sound good. Whats happening?
You should not tolerate that discrimination. I think you should complain to HR.
Well done it must have been quite an experience
Maybe the baby is feeling you  and knows that you two are related
Hm delicious. Do you feel proud of yourself?! 
Good work. Make some for me too!
Oh my gosh! Really? Thats terrible.
What did the manager say?
how did it come out?
what did you put on it?
Scary. Did you investigate?
Phew! Thats a relief!
Hm that sounds suspicious. Where do you think it went?
Do you feel afraid that there might be a ghost in the house?
Nice! Well done. What is the occasion?
Does she know you are going to be better groomed though? Maybe she liked that shagginess!
That must be so annoying. You should ask for a pay raise.
I see time to switch companies! 
Oh no. Were you alright?
I know. Maybe get a cab next time!
I guess thats because hes in a higher position of seniority? 
That is aggravating. You should tell him that you need to get a higher pay for your work!
Amazing. Was there any scares?
Thats cool. You live in teh future now.
Thats a nice thought. Your wife I take it?
I wish I could fidn someone like that
thats great whats in the package?
Oh I guess you got a new boyfie. Chocolates are most often used to show love
They are really cool looking animals!
Are they friendly or aloof?
Really? Noone? Why not?
I understand that. Did you send out invites?
Oh sorry to hear that. How come?
I am sure heshe understood you were just nervous. You should make it up to them. 
i would have also. we always want to give our kids the best
yes unfortunately it happens
how did that happen
ah well that would be a good reason then
Nice do you feel nervous about it?
So you must have prepared well for it. I hope you get the job!
Amazing. Is that even legal though?
Thats cool. Were you scared?
Yeah  do you think it went well then?
Good. I hope you do. When will you find out?
oh thats a good friend
Why his pay was so big?
Then clarify this with any senior 
what happend after that?
wow. for some candy? harsh 
You must be feeling kinda lonely. Have you tried joining any meetup groups?
Good idea. Check to see if there any groups on facebook of your interest.
oh wow thats kind of gross
I dont know if I could even eat a squid if it was fully cooked
thats a great father!
youre the favorite 
Oh my do you know where the dent came from?
Sorry to hear that. I hate when people do that and not even leave a note owning up.
I cant answer that! You seem lonely.
I hope not. Try to have an enjoyable life regardless
Yeah?  whats the job?
Really? Thats interesting. Have you done it before or is this a completely new type of career?
i must have missed that one
ah yea i can only imagine
how did that go? did you have fun?
did he start anything?
Why did you sell them?
Scary! Did you figure out what it was?
Wow Im glad it wasnt something scary lol
Do you have a new job?
Wow. Big step.
Haha Ive done that. She was probably holding in a fart too.
Everyone farts man. Its ok.
Thats crap! Do you know what caused it?
Scumbag. Will it be expensive to fix?
im sure it wasnt as bad as you imagined it in your head unless other people watching the movie told you to hush
I know how you feel. You dont have to let go of them because the value you place on them can be carried forward for generations and that will make them priceless
That is good so you must have prepared well for it.
I hope it goes well for you. Hard work tends to pay off!
I didnt know they still toured. I saw Korn years ago.
expecting something special?
that is always a great day!!!
I would have been too. How did it happen?
That has happened to me before. So aggravating! 
whattttttt....... why did he do that
im sorry to hear that ... hopefully he gets help to deal with issues
Really? In what way?
Nice. I suppose you get what you pay for.
dont think about it what is done is done just anticipate that they will call you back the universe have its way of helping if we believe 
Yes thats the spirit 
It is always nice to have someone by your side when you need it
Really? why the delay?
So sorry about that
I would have totally screamed! Were you alone? What did you do?
I bet it did. Im glad you were able to figure out what it was and hopefully you got some sleep afterwards.
Who was there?
So you just went back to sleep
Thats a good one
That sounds like a plan! Who said that might I ask?
Words of wisdom from him. Will you follow his advice?
Do you think you might get it?
Than I think you have little to worry about.
How did it go than?
Of course it was but next time youll handle it better.
Ha! Do you feel guilty nor or what?!
Exactly! but its okay to cheat a little every now and then!
Oh no! what happened after?
Wow Im sorry you went through that. Not your fault it happens
Because nobody taught them how to live right.
Government? No way it is interested in quite the opposite my friend.
That is really good of you. Hopefully he doesnt decide to stay at your house forever!
Nice I wish I had a friend like that!
did you just start the job?
i would also feel lonely
man that would have scared me too was it an actual intruder?
that is too funny but I have done things like that before as well
Did your younger brother let it out or something like that?
Yes this things happen but as long as you find your dog after its alright.
Ouch I am sorry to hear that. I hope you are ok?
Well I think you should get a new one 
You can ask your best friends if they have a spare before spending money on a new one though
thats great! its good to be supportive of your partner
she sounds like a great person
oh wow are you paying for her classes?
I have 2 daughters myself and hope that they get scholarships
Sorry to hear that. Unfortunately lottery winning is a very small probability. 
sometimes you need to go against the grain.
ah yea .. well thats a good reason
Wow. I have always wanted one myself?  What model?
Oh goodness what was it?
Oh that is so annoying.
Well just stop here and all should be ok.
Try to promise yourself youll never do that it should help.
Oh no what happened to your dog?
Im so sorry to hear that I hope you find it.
wht did you do
yea i can see that
did an unexpected expense come up?
oh that is unfortunatae
I am so deeply sorry! how are you holding up?
Hang in there....and remember its okay to express your feelings
Thats great good for you for taking charge of the situation 
I think its so important to not let things like that bother us Im really pleased for you. 
Good job! You must feel so proud of yourself! 
You should go out for dinner and celebrate!
I agree are you sure youre buying the right groceries? 
Why is that? May I ask.
I know how you feel you dont have to sell it buddy
Special package coming today?
wow thats awesome! I am the same way. As soon as I hit complete order i am counting down the time
I bet.  How long will he be gone?
Maybe you could invite some of your friends over to ease your mind a bit.
Oh that sounds so scary!
Oh thank goodness it wasnt serious.
im glad the pupper was returned
i hate seeing dogs alone in the streets
oh no did you catch them?
what is Friday?!?!
Awww man!  You are lucky!  That sounds amazing!
Did you go into your basement?
Did your house get any damage?
Im sorry is it because their guitarist died?
At least they are making an album thats cool.
Im sorry to hear that... dont blame yourself
Hopefully he opens his eyes soon and realizes what he is doing
I think its time to call the animal protection unit
I believe you will be fine
What job did you apply for?
Do you work for the government now?
yea i can understand that
Thats good. It means you will be on vacation and having fun
oh ok. its good to catch up on old times with foreign friends
I am not married so I am not sure.
Where do you go to meet women?
No way! Id be so upset.... how did she react?
Ouch! Sorry to hear that! Are you mad at him?
I bet he does! But it was just an accident so hopefully you can forgive him. 
That is so cool how does that make you feel?
Yeah those cars are really pricey.
Oh poor dog! I hope he is okay!
I am glad to hear that. I hate seeing animals suffer.
That isnt good. Have you spoken to him about it?
You should talk to him. I am sure he will pick up if you do.
I can understand that it is scary.
Oh that must have been traumatic.
i would have been pissed too!
i hope so too!
oh wow.. that stinks
hopefully you had insurance
That is very nice of your friend.
Oh no Im sorry to hear that
Same here... it really sucks
Oh no is your dog okay?
I hope your dog is found safe.
did he catch you
well at least you were unharmed!
I bet that must have taken you back to the good old days?
Any particular memory stand out that you care to share?
Glad to hear it. Did you get to relax at home?
Oh that must have been nice. It always cheers me up when my kids visit from college.
oh no!! did she find out about it?
that is such sad news
That is so sad. Did you comfort him?
That is so caring of you! Good on you for being a good Samaritan! 
Ah! That must be so frustrating. You should speak to him about this.
I would be too. I want my paper on time!
I hope that never happens again.
wonder how it tastes 
Why were you scared?
Yeah the woods can be scary at night.
That is so cool. You are so lucky to have been able to experience that.
I hope you enjoyed every minute of that. It sounds like a once in a life time experience.
Nothing like moms cooking!
Thats when you know you had a good meal LOL
That must so inconvenient! Are you having trouble falling asleep because of it?
Oh thats a blessing. As long as the baby is asleep all is good! 
Why were you scared to go home alone?
That must be really annoying and scary.
those were the days!
this is true.
im sorry to hear that.
Really? That is cool
Why did you?
those are some good coworkers!
Its nice to work with people who care
Im sorry I hope you find it.
I think you will be fine.
congratulations you will be spending time with your loved one again
I hope you can propose marriage to her when you meet with her
You must be quite confident in your abilities! 
Good to hear. But dont get too overconfident! 
Oh my did they let everyone else leave early except you?
I would be upset if that happened to me. I hope they let you off early next time.
oh thats good.. dang kid!
I hope you have a good time.
wow thats horrible.. did you confront them
Tell me about the fun things
Oh really? Howd you find out?
Well at least you found out easily.
I love cats they are the best.
Yes cats can be difficult to take care of.
I can understand 
I though you went earlier to impress a girl
Wow! Thats amazing! Id love it if my parents got me gifts like that!!
I could imagine. Maybe I should drop some more hints.
That is good its very important to have an instructor like that to calm your nerves. 
He must have been very passionate about teaching his students.
Oh man where customers upset with you?
Sucks how customers blame employees like its their fault
I hate when that happens but that is good they were quick to replace it. 
Hopefully it wasnt something time important 
Oh did he pass?
thats great congratulations
did you look all over for them?
thats good...they are usually ALWAYS in the last place you look.
Oh my goodness that sounds absolutely terrifying. Do you think they wouldve hurt you if they found you?
Youd probably be having even more nightmares. Im glad youre safe though.
Thats a unique experience to go through. Does she have a nice location picked out for it?
Cool! That sounds really special and personal. Im sure they both will really enjoy that!
That is very nice of your sister!
Yeah maybe you should get her a gift of some sort.
Ive never actually watched that show myself. But Ive heard so many good things about it!
I tend to like shorter shows that dont have these super long ongoing plots. So I do have a bit of interest but Im not sure if its really for e.
Im sorry to hear that... it sucks being in a team where no one wants to do anything
I would confront them about it to avoid it happening again
Thats really exciting! Do you have any special plans for this weekend?
Well that does sound like a restful and relaxing weekend. I love traveling on my off time!
do you have roomates?
mine does the exact same thing! i hate it
Aww that had to be a little disappointing?
Yeah that can be life changing money! Maybe next time!
Old houses are the best.
As a kid? Thats the best!
Did you go often with your family?
Oh what is it?
That must be so exciting!
oh no what did she say?
I would have laughed lol
You must be so proud. That really is a great accomplishment that he has made. Is he going to college?
That is so awesome. Does he have a major picked out?
was it an expensive one?
awww...still thats upsetting
Oh no! thats so scary
haha silly cat!
Yeah you can really get in major trouble for doing that.
I would just not do it again.
Im sorry to hear that. Do you know why your neighbor does that to you?
I think you should just continue talking over your neighbor. Maybe that will get your neighbor to stop.
Who does she talk to on the phone regularly?
So why does that make you discontented?
I can imagine that would be a painful waiting period. Why do you belive she is unfaithful?
I can see the why you would feel that way. I would be worried too.
The good news is the chances of actually getting HIV is relatively low. You should not have to worry about it.
I can imagine it would. You dont need that stress in your life.
Oh no did it not turn out the way you planned?
Thats awesome! Hard work always pays off!
Dont be so negative about it. Maybe youll really like the person.
So then just let the person know you cant make it. Theres no reason to waste that persons time.
Thats very good of you. I would be proud of myself If I can do such a thing especially if there is a huge chunk of money in it
I hope he  or she rewarded you though
Thats great! What kind of car did you get?
Wow that is a sweet ride!
Oh no what are going to do?
I hope they can fix your glasses.
i hate when they forget the cheese
i would have been too.. i love my cheese burgers
That is nice to gave a friend that can help you in time of need.
That is not good but my mistake happened.
Sounds pretty incompetent to me.  Have you found a new one yet?
It seems hard finding a good doctor these days.
Congrats! Its great to pass your test. Though staying up all night to study may not be the best studying technique.
Thats good. I try to study well in advance. But I find it hard to actually motivate myself.
haha thats funny! 
Im glad you survived lol
That must be quite nostalgic.
I miss the old times.
is it a newer model?
Im sorry to hear that. Its really horrible when a friend backs out at the last second.
Theres always scalpers outside of concert venues. That could probably work.
Wow what a forward woman.
Yeah Im sure you were.
lol...thats harsh! are you?
hahah...that is natural
Thats great you have that kind of confidence.
That is very responsible of you.
first of all my condolences for your friend and i know how hard this is for you both
ya it feels so weak to be in that place  but you should only give the strength required for your friend to overcome this situation
you can do it  i pray that you both overcome this situation with peace. 
Thats awful! Maybe you can pay them back?
Oh wow thats tough. Hopefully they dont know it was you at least.
That is bad. I hope you will find something interesting to do.
I understand. Probably watching a new movie could be good idea.
Oh yea? why is that?
I wish there is a way we can make people care more about the environment
Oh no im sorry to hear that
It happens... but you never know their situation and sometimes people make bad financial decisions
That sounds so disgusting!
I would have done that too.
Why she want to divorce? Did she tell you?
That is terrible. How did you find out?
Yikes did you miss a payment?
It shouldnt have maybe you need to call customer service and question them as to why.
I am sure you are beautiful too!
I wish you had a higher selfesteem.
Wow! I can imagine how joyous that feeling must have been!
Congrats! That would be really stressful. Im happy it all worked out for you.
Oh no that isnt good. Im sorry
Did he just freeze up on the test or was it different then the stuff you studied?
i hope all goes well. was something the matter that made you decide to have the tests done?
always good to check if in doubt
Oh no I am so sorry! I bet that must have been scary too
wow they should care more that youre safe!
I love pizza. What style pizza does the place make?
Yeah that sounds very exciting.
Uhoh I hope you didnt get in trouble?
Well you can use that feeling to make sure you dont do it again!
That is terrible. What did you do?
Well that is a good way to look at it.
Thats great trust is the backbone of all lasting relationships.
Of course were not meant to lock ourselves away alone for our entire lives.
That is bad. Did you go to a doctor?
Then nothing to worry about.
I do too. It always brings back so many good memories.
Yes it is. Sometimes I wish you could just go back to that time.
I am sorry to hear that. Thieves are really crappy people.
I hope they catch the person and you get your laptop back.
Oh wow! Are you okay?
That is insane.  Thank God there was someone there to intervene.
Oh why is that? Do you play?
Ah yeah my husband is the same way. He is very excited.
Good for him! Thats a very valuable skill to have good on you for teaching him so early.
Does he seem to enjoy being in the water or does he resist you a bit?
Oh I know that feeling actually... Did you ever make up with your friend?
Thats good to hear. Its all water under the bridge now as they say.
That sounds like fun what kind of movie will you see?
Nice I love those. I have seen a preview for a shark attack movie that is coming out. I think called Meg I hope to see that sometime
I love eating there the food is always amazing.
I am glad you had such a good meal.
I hope it wasnt a close friend that lied.
That is sad.  Liars and thieves are just the worst.
I dont blame you.  A friend like that isnt a friend at all.  Im sorry that has happened to you.
Thats embarrassing but also funny. How did your date react?
That is awesome that she didnt make a big scene of it!
I understand. It could be little bit scary at first but it is fun.
Aww   What did you end up doing instead?
You couldve always come on here and chat with other cool people like you D
Oh no are they going to be okay?
Oh that will be so fun!
Oh my I hope she is ok?
I would be too!  Was she at fault?
Wow. It is very unsual to see that.
Why? Do you want to do like him?
That is so sweet of your child.
He must be very smart!
Thats annoying! Did you end up eating it anyway?
Sorry that you had a bad experience!
Wow whats the special occasion?
Yeah that is going to be a lot of work and hard to transport to your job.
Aww was it your birthday or something?
OOO Kid Rock thats one of my friends favorites!
I bet its always nice to get a chance to work with someone you really like.  Where do you work?
That does suck.  I work at Taco Bell making burritos.
You must be very proud of your new set of teeth
Congrats you can smile freely now 
What preferences do you mean? You shouldnt have to say your truth to anyone.
Theres nothing wrong with that and its a shame people even question you about that.
Congratulations! When is the wedding?
Im happy for you I hope everything continues to work out!
Oh no! That is so sad for you.  How embarrassing. 
how sad.  I am so sorry you had to deal with that.
Oh no! Did you manage to avoid a stain?
Dont feel ashamed. Youll be able to laugh about it soon enough!
How did it went?
That is terrible. What are going to do?
Oh god that sounds terrible! Are you okay is everyone in your house okay? Did anyone get hurt?
Im glad to hear that no one in your house got hurt. Gang crime needs to be stopped!
Im sorry that happened. Do you still have contact with him?
Cliche as it is time heals all wounds and whatnot. I hope you can find somebody just as great as him or learn to be content on your own!
That is horrible! Do you think it is really true or she was trying to just make you angry? 
You can always try to get a DNA test.
Are you worried and nervous?
I hope they do and everything is ok
That is terrible.
Who fault it was?
Sorry to hear that. Is the feeling mutual?
That is awful! Hopefully things work out for the better for you!
Oh my lord I would have been terrified. Are you okay?
I am glad to hear you are okay.
I feel you! Summer is great and all but I miss my classmates and the work Im studying.
I hope you have a successful semester!
How did you do ?
Congratulations I hope you get a raise.
Oh. I hope you get it! 
Thats a pretty substantial raise! 
Wow!  I would have been spooked about that too.  What did you do?
How fun! How did you all celebrate?
Thats really nice of you. Catfish sure sounds good to me right now!
Yeah I remember mine as well. They were always a great time.
That sounds like so much fun too bad those times had to ever end.
WOW!  Congrats!  Was it hard contest?
You must be very smart!
Nice! what kind of car is it
Youre pretty lucky to have a boss like that haha
Oh goodness that is terrible.
Yeah delivery services have really fallen off.
OMG!  How nasty!
Did he at least offer to share with you?
Im sorry that happened. Maybe she was tired from working all day.
Oh I understand. Have you talked to her about how you feel about it?
I have never had greek cuisine
There arent many restaurants where I live. Only fast food.
That is great she will fit right in!
What an excellent way to start school!
What are union memners points?
Oh. Maybe they should lower the fees or up the rewards
Sounds fun! What movie are you going to watch?
Oh. Well thats lovely.. I suppose. Lol. Maybe you should amend the movie night rules with a different theme every time so they are more constrained to what they have to choose from! Haha!
Nervous? Thats interesting. Has anything changed recently? What are your thoughts on why its happening?
I see. Im sorry youre having trouble with that. Have you thought about therapy? Maybe your health insurance will cover a free consultation or something. Or perhaps you just need a simple routine change with some exercise and more time outside. I hope you find the answer whatever it is.
That was rough how long ago was this ?
Im sorry you had to endure this.
Thats pretty nice. Im in college and Ive had three different roommates so far having to move three different times. Starting to get old. You truly lucked out!
I hope you guys are able to keep in touch. With that kind of experience it sounds like it could be a good friend for life. As we get older we let those kinds of people slip through our fingers. Try to maintain it as best you can.
That is too bad. What are you going to do? Was this your first time gambling?
That is too bad that you had to learn a lesson that way. I am sorry.
Its nice that you tried to comfort him.  Im worried about my parents also.  Its hard to be worried about something like that in your family knowing that you have no control over whether or not it will happen.  Its sad.
Agreed  its very stressful.  I live half a country away from my parents and Im worried I wont be able to help when either of them need it.  
I feel for you. My girlfriend is in the same position. Luckily we dont have kids to complicate things but her job wears her out and it doesnt seem like she can physically or mentally keep up with it. Kids just make it so that you feel you have to do it until you die no matter what.
At least it sounds like youre giving it a lot of thought. You sound resilient. Most people would just quit or get fired or not even realize the negative impact its putting on their children. You seem very selfaware so Im sure you will be able to figure out the best decision for everyone involved. Good luck!
That stinks. Im sorry about that
Omg I was about to say that is so mean and rude and I would be so embarrassed but I know it was a honest mistake I dislike the auto correct. 
lol I hope your friend understood and they can still meet up or communicate and if things work out its a funny to tell in the future. 
What happens on Saturday?
That sounds really cool. Have fun!
I think its about time you lay down some rules!
Is this a roommate situation or are we talking about kids? 
Oh my yeah I would have been pretty irritated! 
Yes it stinks when things just dont work out but keep your head up Im sure you will find someone you like that will be a big help to you!
Nice!  Six months is a long time to be carless.  Im sure you have a new sense of freedom to do what you want and need to do while hes at work now.
Thats funny  true.  Hopefully the good part outweighs that though.  
Well that still makes you a great friend! 
Sounds like you all should stay away from bars lol. But if it keeps you acting good at home then so be it. Your friend sounds like he needs a crack too
Thats cool.  What type of supplements
That sounds pretty healthy.  Have you always been this health conscious
Have you had trouble lately?
I hope things go well for you too.
Oh really? I hate winter though! I dont want that to arrive 
I prefer it over the winter if I have to make a choice
Its nice that you have a meaningful item from her.  Its a pretty bittersweet feeling thinking about someone you loved who is gone.  
Thats nice  its nice that you have memories like that.  I only have a couple of items from my grandparents and I treasure them. 
That would take such toll one me. Just make sure they have enough to keep them occupied maybe.
Might have to bring them to the park and tire them out. School should starting up soon.
Thats awesome! Its always pleasant to have a good day.
Little surprises like that really bring a new meaning to life!
Oh I hate it when that happens  Have you looked on places like mercari or ebay?
Yes! I get makeup I need more than half off on those places
I find this context hard to believe.
Oh geez! Really that is interesting but why would they want too!
Are you a cop yourself
Dang whereabouts do you live man? Im in South Texas sometimes cops are like that here too
Well that is kind of you. They must really be going through something.
That would be a lot to deal with. I hope things stay good for awhile.
Oh god! I would be SO TICKED! Do they have cameras?
That is AWFUL! My mom had that happen too An old guy hit her atthe gas station and sped off! Seriously not fair!!
Oh man that sounds horrible. I would probably faint.
It must have hurt so much. 
Thats amazing  I am sorry for your loss But atleast you have a constant reminder of him.
Thats so sweet.  He is probably looking down happy you are wearing it!
Oh no! Did you ever end finishing it up in time?
Thats good I just finished studying for a final And I barely finished in time!
Oh no thats terrible! Are you going to apply again?
I understand. Maybe apply at a different bank this time.
Woow. That is terrifying. Are you alright? Do you live in some rural areas?
Thankfully. Hearing your story i am terrified now to even walk in my back yard anymore
Yes that always saddens me too. I see them now and then.
Yeah there should be but often there is not really a good option for them.
Good for you.  Being honest is important.
Sometimes thats the best way to learn
The note is for what?
well expect my note toothough it would be a soft copy
What country? If you dont mind sharing...Im in South Texas and loving it 
Im sure youll meet some cool people if you find a good Pho restaurant!
Wow she must really fancy you. You should ask her how she found you.
What a random surprise. Just make sure its not some creepy stalker. 
Oh that is so gross! I hate bugs too!
I hope none of them found a way home with you.
Wow so close to graduation!  What does he want to do after he graduates?
Oh no!  I hope youre able to.  I know its hard for kids to look at the longer bigger picture of life sometimes and just what hes going through now.  I took my GED early at 16 and graduated so maybe he wants to do that and start something else sooner.
budget for what?
You mean you have a budget for life?
Maybe she has too much on her plate?
Mistakes happen! I am sure people arent too upset. I have numb hands so I drop things all the time
That is true! But its part of life stuff happens. Not the worst!
Feeling a bit scared about the weekend.
I have a hard time with my anxiety sometimes and I will be alone a lot this weekend. I dont like free time I like to stay busy so I dont think much.
I dont trust a lot of people. I do like being alone sometimes but if not then I just want to be with someone I trust They are not always available.
Thats annoying. So does it still work and its just hard to use or does it just do nothing in general? Deals are always tricky like that as sometimes theyre too good to be true.
Yeah especially since customer service is usually where companies skimp and dont try to hire or train employees very well. Well I hope it has a good resolution in the end and something works out in your favor. Im a clean freak so Id hate to not be able to clean properly when I wanted or needed to.
That is just sad of a Dad to be that way. Kids need a lot of unconditional love..but parents arent always perfect and sometimes dont know how to love their kids like they should !
Still doesnt make it okay. I hope he gets some therapy and learns to be a better dad
Oh gross!  They should have street cleaners taking care of that.  Poor animal.  
I bet.  I have never seen one up close so that turns my stomach too.  I cant stand seeing injured hurt or dead animals. Hope youre feeling better now.
I bet you are proud!
Good I wish him all the best!
I agree. I used to be a deadbeat but now my life is dope.  Are you talking about a friend or family member
Yes you can lead a horse to water...but you know the rest
Definitely not a sucker! If she helped you a lot and you wouldnt be here without her then YES! Why did she block you? Were you bad to her? Sounds familiar to what has happened between me and a few...I was there for them but had enough and I have had to cuit them out too
That is hard..I have been abused and burned...and sometimes you just cant go back..Its like the story of a the girl with the feather pillow..once you say something..you cant ever get it back and its so hard to repair. Its hard to ever trust someone once they have broken it..I am there myself and dont know if I could ever trust or live with that person again. Life is hard but I am VERY glad you have learned and will treat others better
Thats always a weird situation. Youre excited about the offer and youre worried that if you turn it down that you might not be able to find anything else or as good. But you also dont want to be tied down to a bad place. What were some of the red flags if you dont mind me asking?
Thats a really tough position to put yourself in. You would know better than most. Im a cautious person.. if I felt like there was even a 50 chance of being able to find something close to decent Id turn them down. But if you think its a desert out there and you cant find something to come close it may be worth gritting your teeth and being there for a few years before you try to move on. I hope it works out!
That is tough. I would just make sure everything is nice and clean around the house so she can just unwind. Maybe make a nice dinner and do the dishes after.
I see. I would maybe only bring it up if she wants to discuss. It a hard position to be in.
Anywhere else? lol You do not have a lot of thai places in town?
Everything to me lol!  Sweet and sour chicken is the BEST
That sounds like a fine day to me. Do you have many birds?
Hah I know how you feel I love to feed birds and watch them outside my house as well.
Oh no! I am so sorry Turtles need a lot of care to thrive
Actually they are that is why so many die in captivity..They need proper lights and diet etc..I guess if you know how to take care of animals then no but so many just dont care when they have a pet who relies on them
What happened to the first one?
Im sure it will be fine.  Did you buy a good brand?
Yeah occasionally stuff breaks during shipping.
So sorry you never really can tell with these things can you?
I wish you good luck.
Me too. I cant take this heat anymore. It is so muggy outside. Its so annoying.
Same here. The humidity is just the absolute worse. 
is there anything like free cash?
i had that nothing good come easily
Oh nice.  What type of presentation
You think it will be a big success?
Thats awesome!  Any new changes lately?
That sounds fun! Im glad youre more comfortable now.
Can you have it repaired?
Yes Im sure youll be very nice to her.
I am so sorry. I know that must be a difficult time.
I hope you can find the positive in the situation and move forward. Focus on yourself.
That should be fun. Where does the cruise go to?
The Bahamas is beautiful. I am sure you will love it.
They really do make you stronger dont they. It may not seem like it right away though.
That is a great way to make the best out of the worst. Good for you.
Good luck! Hope you do well
Im sure youll get a good grade if you prepared well
wow thats grate. Are you also a musician?
complete family with so much talent
That makes you a queen.
Whats that ?
Wow! That would be an awesome surprise to come home to!
I would love to have that happen for me! You are lucky!
Oh you did? What kind of job?
Are you a stylist? 
Thats great! How can you tell you are on the right path?
Congrats! Thats awesome
that is good i hope nothing went wrong
you should be proud of them. Nothing like family
I hope it works out for you then.
Well stick in there and youll go far.
Wow that would be a huge accomplishment if you did it!
Excellent hopefully you will share some of your wealth with me.
Thats great.  She sounds like a passionate and independent woman.
I wish her and you the most abundant blessings and wealth and success.
That was nice of him. What was it?
That is great! Were you able to help pick it out?
what kind of weather is that?
yah safety first. 
what kind of fun did you remember having there
wow quite a long time
He should be fine if he has prepared. I hope he does well.
That great. Im sure you are real proud of him.
Oh well maybe youll get your blessings in a different way you didnt expect
Its cool I got fired from my old job 5 months ago...only to upgrade to a selfemployed lifestyle making 2000 a week and hot chicks coming in and out of my apartment every night lol
its sad but true people dont want to see others doing well! got to be ready to protect what is yours! 
just keep working learning and trying new things cant go wrong like that i think!
Well I hope you have fun and I hope she does well.
I bet that was frightening and nerve racking.
At least you made it through allright.
Did you play there a lot as a child?
Well I hope you can recover from that as time passes.
Im sorry to hear that. How long has she been sick?
Absolutely! I would do anything for my kids too.
because she wanted to give you a surprise present
hahahahah i like the suspense she is good at giving surprises 
Horror movies give me so much anxiety. I cant watch them late at night.
Maybe watch a comedy tonight. That might help out a little.
That is amazing.  Those moments are wonderful and priceless!  How old is she now?
I love when they are young and it so fun to see what they learn and discover each day.  When they say enjoy every moment they are so right!
It is the start of their learning journey be excited!
Definitely I wish them the best
Oh no have you made adjustments to ensure that wont happen again?
I bet kids need a lot of eyes on them but its a catch22 because you do not want to be too over protective
Oh no is she ok?
Im so sorry. Do you have a good support system?
How much is that?
Oh wow that will help you out immensely.
The quality of driving is going down and down.
Yeah I agree. weve have to drive carefully.
Did you want to go to New York?
Maybe you will win something else!
Oh no!  Was it a big one or not that big of a deal?
Oh good.  Well at least its a big deal to you because that means youre taking things seriously and concerned about your work.  
Oh no did people make you feel bad for the accident?
That sucks if everyone pitched in to help it probably wouldve been cleaned up in record time.
Yes all it takes is cutting back on some things you maybe dont need. I know it can be  hard to do though!

You still have her right there with you!  Its wonderful to know that youre keeping her food and memories so alive!
Yea that is kind of a weird situation. I am sure she would want you to have a good time though.
I wouldnt let it ruin a good time. Just dont mention it anymore maybe. Im sure you feel a little guilty.
What was the opportunity?
Did you put money on the reno?
Haha that wasnt very wise.
Thats great! Are you excited about school too?
Ohh wow! Well good luck and I hope you have a great time with your friends and school
Wow that is horrible what did you guys come down with?
Wow I hope you guys get better if you already havent.  Thats really a bummer to miss out on a family vacation!

Awesome!  I know isnt that crazy how much repairs can cost?  Its ridiculous.  Well happy travels!
Oh yeah? Whats happening on Saturday?
Congratulations! I hope you have something fun planned to celebrate.
The sounds very interesting I am sure you could find others like it as well
Did you do it on pourpuse? and if so did you feel bad after?
but it was an accident on your part so dont feel so bad about it
Was it yours?
Eww. Im sorry about that. That would have ruined my lunch quickly
They must be a very good insurance company to be able to keep your business for that lnog!
Well thats always a plus. Having a good relationship with the company or someone at the company can go a long way.
That is amazing.  Most of those guys have been training for years for that level of eating.  What kind of pies were they?
He really should.  Some of those folks make really good money just to eat a lot.  Pretty sweet gig! hahaha.
Oh no! Sorry to hear that. Can you get it fixed?
Wow thats expensive! I hope you can find a reasonable used car.
Thats cool Im not too familiar with it myself.  Is it pretty interesting so far?
Its always nice to get lost in a good book.  One of my favorite hobbies.
Oh no!  That is always terrible when technology stops working well.  What did you do to fix it?
Thats awesome!  You are talented! Maybe itll go for another year so you can save.
Congratulations! If it helps at all my wife and I have two young boys and both of her deliveries with very smooth! She said it wasnt as bad as she expected.
I think those types of situations are rather rare! The medical field has come a very long way. Im sure youll be fine and itll all be worth it in the end.
im glad you were not harmed
im sorry im sure it wasnt your fault
Thats great! I love to design websites
Thats neat! I learned in college so Ive had time to delve into it quite a bit and it is very fun. You choose great!

Disneyland is awesome I went there twice as a kid!  What did you have to eat?

can i join you?
Wow! Well I hope you enjoy yourself and pray before you go on the plane
Im sorry to hear that. How did she die?
Oh wow! That stinks. How are you holding up?
Im so sorry to hear that! My sister went through something similar last year and I can tell you that it will help a lot to spend time with her as often as you can.
Stay strong! Hopefully in the future she can have a healthy baby and be able to move on from this tragedy.
Aw thats never fun.  My husband used to travel all the time for work and it was so lonely.  Im glad she wont be gone too long.  I took advantage of the times he was gone to clean and organize and fix things to surprise him when he returned.
Wow youre on top of things! Being apart does make the heart grow fonder.  Make or carry out her a romantic dinner when she gets back. Go out with a friend while shes gone!
Did you do everything right?
Well that stinks. That happens though. Sometimes you do something right and it doesnt show the same result as its supposed to 
Why didnt you sleep well?
I am sorry. You should get some sleep now then
Oh no whyd you have to cancel?
Maybe you can plan for another time?
Holy cow! Thats amazing! Congrats!
Thats really amazing. How generous.
I HATE when that happens. In my case it was a dog I caught him on camera! Maybe you should invest in a security cam?
I hear if you sprinkle red pepper all over your trash area it can help ward off some animals.
Oh no!  That wouldve made me so mad.  I let my kids use my computer too but always say no drinks by it and wash your hands.  Kids always seem to forget that. 
It is a hard balance because they need to learn and it should make you mad but people do make mistakes.  So hard to know how to act really but things are too expensive to not treat them well.  I hope youre able to find an easier way to fix it.
Did you not go?
That stinks. You should go this weekend?
Oh no! Im really bad about that too. Did you ask someone or try to play it off?
Nice. Thats a good way to do it.

I think thats a good idea. Look at it as an opportunity to make new friends.
Thats good are you going out later?
Thats awesome hope you both have fun.
That is good did they cheat  on you?
Ouch that always hurts.  Ive been through that and know that sting.  Hope you find a better partner who cares for you!
I look forward to the day where I can say the same! That must feel liberating!

I wouldnt change it for the world
Do you have a lot of debt?  Im sure you will figure it out and get back on your feet.

welli wish you sucess
you need my friendits just like a success spell
Who did?  What happened? Are you OK?
Wow!  Thats horrible!  Dont feel bad though.  She is obviously just a gold digger.  You most likely just dodged a bullet!
Did something specific happen?
I think that can affect even the best of us I wouldnt let it get you down.
Thats really sweet of you to help her out.
haha yea thats a good way to look at it.  I never thought of it like that
Are you scared you may want to in the future and it would be too late?
It is never too late!  You can always adopt!
my cousin and my aunt are both teachers and they love it
haha. its alot of work but its rewarding
oh no. what was it?
that can be so traumatizing. im so sorry.
Its always so exciting to take a trip or vacation.  but its even more exciting to see family
Haha yea thats how I feel about my In laws.  Im glad they are a 4 hour plane ride away
what sounds like a wonderful time?
That does sound like a lot of fun.  I miss hanging out with all of my firends
why are you so mad?
Yes my friend experienced the same thing recently. It is a terrible thing especially when they make you pay to repair it.
Oh wow yeah that is quite impressive! He should become a lawyer if he isnt one already!
Yeah I have heard some people have that! Sometimes after just reading a bunch of information just once can remember every single word!
Haha!  I know exactly what you are talking about!  I love that show and yes it is quite gross!  You must have felt quite disgusted!
Ooo!  Yuck!  I hope you dont get nightmares from it!
oh no. what happened?
oh goodness. where you able to make it out of there without getting sick or dirty?
That can be a lot of work.  We are trying to go through that now too so i know how you are feeling
My thoughts and prayers are with you guys.  I hope you succeed.  Make sure you keep practicing
that is awful why did he do that
did you tell him the truth?
I can imagine that was very scary! I dont know if I would be that brave!
I guess it was a lifetime opportunity too. Im sure it was an amazing experience!
Why do you feel that way
That does sound hard
Uhoh. be careful there are some bad drivers out there.  Especially with people playing on their phones while driving
Ive actually called the police during a situation like that.  I was worried someone was going to get killed
Do you guys not get together as much? 
I know that feeling I have a brother I dont see as much as I used to.
Dogs are the best
That was very nice of you
i love driving past old places from my childhood too! they always seem much smaller than i remember
its great that you were able to go visit
That doesnt sound very safe.  I hope you dont lose power
well stay inside and stay dry
That sucks. I know how you feel.  Do you have a day job?
That sucks. Ive also been through that. Among other benefit cuts.
thats pretty neat.  I think that might be worth a lot of money
well that might make it more valuable to you then.  Does it still work?
Well... did you?
Ah too bad youre married.    Pros and cons
Ugh. Those are the worst.
I wish people could be more considerate on the road. Its so annoying.
Do you like your new city?
How do your friends feel about the situation?
What is the CPA exam?
I bet he must be extremely relieved and happy to have that exam behind him. Those exams can be extremely nerve wracking. Did he have longs periods of study time?
Oh no that is scary!  Did his owner get control of him quickly?
Goodness it was a good thing you were right there and able to usher them inside so quickly.  I cant imagine the results had you not been able to get to them quick enough!
the unknown gives me so much stress
it get so bad i get severe anxiety
Im sorry to hear that Is he going to the doctor for help?
Oh wow it sounds like he is doing great I hope he feels better soon!
I completely understand 
I feel for you and hope you have a way to manage it 
I bet! I would be so jealous too! Maybe your neighbor will let you come over and swim?
Thats a great way to look at it take advantage of their investment for now and then later you can have your own pool!
Wow! That is cool do you spend a lot of time with him?
I hope you many more years of happy marriage!
Did everything turn out alright?
Hopefully they can work it out
Its nice to get a good sweat
Thats no fun!  How long did they have you waiting?
Dont be too angry.  They might just have been swamped with prescriptions to fill.
It will be worth it though
I am sure you will be safe
Yeah I dont think anyone likes going. How did it go?
I am glad you got the help you needed and I hope you get better soon.
Ouch are you alright?
I bet.  Did your work cover your medical bills?
oh yippeee! what kind of puppy?
i bet. dogs are amazing. we have a big ole mutt who is 75 lbs of lap dog love
Oh wow that would be nice
It gives you something to work for
Yeah thats sad I hope it found its owner somehow.
Yeah you cant always help everybody and everything though.
Try not to be.  Focus on yourself and your goals.  Use their judgmental looks to push you workout to the max!
I hope it helps!
Bosses are sometimes unaware it seems
I would hate working there
i have a pet rabbit. that makes me sad
sometimes on my way to work i find deer skunk cats misc other dead animals and it makes me so sad
Well that is what makes life fun
Wow thats super lucky! So you have no idea where it came from?
Thats a true blessing. I am very happy for you!
That is so funny but I know exactly how you feel.  Sometimes vacations can get too long.  Did you leave town?
That sounds like a heck of a trip!
That is good to hear.  Have you been ill for a while.  I hope not.
Thats really to bad.  I hope the medicine works well and you are back to normal very soon!
i used to sit in 2 hours of traffic daily. no longer is that my problem

I believe that was me
Ha well I still feel bad about it I promise

You sound like you are going to do well then
I am glad it was easy for you
Aw yeah Ive been missing my Mom lately as well.
Hopefully your mom hasnt passed away and you just havent visited her in a while.
That is so crazy.  I love how Facebook reconnects people from so long ago.  Do you have any plans to meet up some time?
What has he been up to in the mean time?
That must be frustrating but it really sounds like your trying to look at it in a positive light and that always makes things a little easier!
Uh oh. Was it bad?
Well at least it wasnt too bad...even if it was a little embarrassing.
Its nice to find good deals
That sounds so nice Im jealous.
I definitely need to. Hope you can also continue to enjoy relaxing time.
How did you do
Aww its nice to relive those old memories sometimes.
Pictures are nice to have to be able to look back on life.
Kids can be annoying
Screaming is never good
Why did you lie about it?
I am a saints fan so I am excited too ha
I read it today he is a different kind of guy for sure
That is a great attitude to have.  I know it is hard to go through periods of struggle.  Do you have hope that things will get better soon?
That is phenomenal!  In hard times it is easy to distace ourselves from God but I believe it is important to press in and cast our cares on Him.
Oh really? Actually I think that is a good thing. Hows is going?
I think thats a good decision by your and your wife. And I think your wifes grandmother is going to recover well.
They will be good again
I am a saints fan though ha
What game was that?
Which teams played?
Well I hope they play well for you 
It happens sometimes...I get fired up watching the Lakers play lol.
Is it all expenses paid?
Well congrats on winning that?
My son really liked Pokemon too! He liked playing the card game and watching the show.
Yes and I know there are still some fans around now too. Of course they are more popular ones.
What kind of work is it
That does not sound fun at all
I know what you mean hope it gets better!
I get that here is to hoping it shows up soon!
Thats unfortunate. I have missed them before too and I hate when that happens.
Oh wow! How lucky! Perfect timing.
I bet that was a huge relief.
Dont be jealous instead brush on your studying and start going to the gym.
Yeah I do agree. Sometimes it seems like people are just plain blessed.
I get that but things are still better for those around you so it feels bad still
I dont follow football much.  Were they not the favored to win?
Oh wow.  Were you hoping the other team would win?
Oh really? Kayaking is awesome! What a fun and adventurous person you must be. 
Hiking and kayaking? Wow! Better pack some trail mix.
I am sure it will get better
You just need to make a plan for yourself
oh well that sucks! It can be very aggravating to spend time working on something and then have it destroyed!
Yes not only a waste of your time but the money. No doubt very frustrating and Im sure you wanted to teach the dog a lesson 
Thats great that you have such trust in him. 
That is a true friend thats worth having for a lifetime if possible. I am happy for you.
I bet they will miss you not being there
You will have time again
I bet that is nervewracking! I hope you get it.
ah it happens lol
Feeling nostalgic can be great. Where are you from?
I can see why you miss it as I actually live in New Orleans currently.
Being positive is all you can do
Being busy always helps things
Oh nice. Im happy that you got some rest. What do you do for work?
Sounds pretty interesting. I hope everything goes well for you.
Oh yeah? Did you get any good tips from him?
Thats inspirational at least. Im sure we can all do better at saving.
Oh that sounds pretty nice
Well I guess if youre a pretty regular gymgoer you shouldnt feel bad about missing a day every once in a while.
Hey no problem. Just gotta lift heavier next time haha
I think that is normal are you still friends
Oh well you will find someone else
That is a nice way to wake up. Was it a good day?
That is really good. I am happy to hear that.

Well I hope you feel better and get some rest. Maybe next weekend will be better for you.
Oh wow that is impressive indeed
I assume he got you there ok?
Sounds like youve got a good brother.
Income is very important always
Luck has nothing to do with usually
Sometimes if the storm is severe enough its best to just pull over.
I guess nowadays with how everything is going it just feels like rush rush rush. Gotta sink or swim
Thats always fun to look at pictures.
Thats good to have.
I am sorry that is always sad
Oh wow it had a good life I am sure
Oh my lord I am glad you are okay
That is understandable.  Did you end up going?
Are you going out again?
I have felt that for sure in the past
It just gave me a positive feeling really
What made you feel that way?
I guess just make sure not to push it there is a fine line between confidence and pride.
That is really nice.  What did you all do?
I love craft beer.  How many of you were ther?
That is so gross and rude
I guess that is a no
Thats nothing to be depressed about. 
Start hanging out with friends and enjoy life.
Did you check the last place you had it?
Oh thats lame. He should have checked for you.
I am sure you deserved some candy
You shouldnt its nice to have some candy every once and awhile
I know what you mean.  My dad carries a gun in his car so I wont let him drive my kids anywhere.  What did you do?
Thats great good for him! Its always makes you feel good when your hard work is appreciated.
Well its nice that you are happy for him as well. Im sure he can find many uses for the extra money.
Are you going to see her again? 
Oh thats terrible. Did you get it resolved?
Maybe the banks fault? Oh well at least it came in! Better late than never.
Are you excited about it
I hope it goes well
That kind of stuff is always scary.  Do you have the results yet?
I am so glad to hear it!  Are you feeling better though?
Do they have any idea what is going on?
I do too.  My wife has been very sick for the last 13 years and she just switched to a diet called Nutritarian and after three months is almost back to her old self.
Oh no! Is everything okay? What happened?
Wow that firsttime fire extinguisher purchase and replacement of the fire alarm batteries was definitely a blessing.
Its always nice to have that perspective
That is very true
What was wrong?
Oh did they find out why?
Well thats good. Sounds like you guys will be having some fun watching the game. Much better than TV!
Well I hope you guys have a good time
Oh how long were you dating?
Well they made up for it last year
Oh yeah I forgot about that ha
Why were you so surprised?
Do you have any other favorite teams?
Oh thats terrible. Its been so hot lately. I bet you struggled.
Well I hope you can get it fixed soon! Still more hot days to come yet.
Any fun plans?
How did they do that?
Oh is that the newest? I havent played on one since super nintendo!
What is it like playing it is it virtual reality?
Thats never fun. Hope you can make time with them next week.
Good friends are worth trying repeatedly for.
A prodigy huh?  What instrument does he play?
That is awesome!  Does he have any recitals coming up?
My brother just bought a new watch and I want it so bad.
I cant afford it but maybe hell give it to me for Christmas.
I hope you get it! What type of job did you apply for
What traits do you have that make you think youre qualified for the job
Its nice to be prepared
I will have to start doing that
Its nice to have friends like that
Its nice to have people there for you always
I hate that. Especially at nighttime. It can be pretty scary.
Might have to sleep with the lights on next time it happens. Haha
Never a good thing did she have a good reason or ask to reschedule?
Thats not fun but maybe it was for the best.
That must have been nice.  What did they make you?
Very nice.  Did you enjoy it?
Oh no is it able to be saved
Oh lord! I am glad you have something that is a healthy hobby
Thats cool! Its always good to have a hobby
Do you have an example?
That is never fun I always return the favor
I dont like gory movies but scary ones I do. I used to be the same way as you though.
I wont either haha just not my thing! 
Ah maybe it will look up for you. She could still call?
Well even if she doesnt you could always be straightforward with her and just ask her if shes not into you then let you know so you can move on.
Just thinking positive thoughts
Its good to have faith
Ok if thats what you decide to do I believe you have had time to think it through 
Ok the most important thing is that you have a source that pays for the bills
Connecting with the people that mattered the most makes me super excited
Oh I bet that is going to be fun
I hope you have fun then
Very nice. The weather should be perfect.
Drink a few beers and have a hotdog for me. Should be fun.
Hey well at least they didnt do too bad last year

I am sorry you have a bad back

I always hate seeing any kind of animal on the side of the road
The worst is seeing something that looks like one of your pets too. Always fear for a break out at home

Those games do seem fun
Are you gonna get a bonus for it?
Good best of luck with that you deserve it!

Oh wow Im sorry to hear that! I hope things start looking better for you. Can you file for disability or social security? 
I completely understand.  I get pretty aggravated myself driving home from work everynight.
It takes me almost an hour to get home through traffic.
Oh no was the cop understanding

Why did you need to wait?
Oh you couldnt download it anyways?
I feel like you should to if you know you work hard go for it.
Maybe go to HR I had to do that for my raise and they spoke to my supervisor and he agreed.
Sounds like you deserve it then
I understand I feel the same way sometimes. Its hard because sometimes you cant help or know they have problems that made them homeless like drinking.
Yes sometimes they wont accept when I offer them food. They just want money to buy beer. It is very sad!
Why were you feeling that way
That is very scary
Ohh whats that for? a party?

I hate when they do that
That is probably best

It is amazing. For how long have you been playing this game?
I played a lot of video games when I was kid. I liked that so much.

I am excited for you its unbelievably beautiful!
dang.. how long has he been doing that?

whats going on
my daughter started today. she was so excited 
Thats always disappointing. You have a certain taste in mind but its not quite right
You should let them know it has not gone unnoticed! 
Oh no!  Did she give you a reason why?
Thats hard but at least you know now and can perhaps move on.
You got a good sister!
Will you make it up to her?
I sorry to hear that I hope you get it back.
Im sure it wont happen again.
That should be delicious.
I understand. I have sometimes the same feeling.
I know right now hes a Laker.
I hate the Warriors!

Time to grab a blanket. You mean that its inaccurate?
Sounds like you are stuck between a rock and a hard place! I hope you get it sorted out swiftly!
Woah.  I would be too.  What do you think happened?
How can people do that!  Its awful.  I think you can use those suction things to get dents out pretty well.  Sorry that happened to you.
were you happy to see him early ?
Whats in it?
Sounds like some good stuff
Thats awesome!  Did you request it and just werent expecting it or did you just get a random day off?
I love when that happens!  Good its about time you got it.  I hope you enjoy whatever youre doing with the time off!

time to slash some tires
I need to do the same

I need to try and do that.

How many kids do you have
I dont have any either so I feel your pain.

Enjoy it while its still here.
Was it the company with the Gecko?

Awww.. I love cats.. Sorry.. I was yelling at my boyfriend..
Awww.. I hope you find him.. he is playing video games and being super lazy
He sucks he doesnt work or do chores at home.. PS4 247
He thinks I am his mother I think he wants to be mothered
Oh I feel the exact opposite! lol. What are you looking forward too?
OHH! That would be wonderful! Sleeping in is the best when you can do it!
that was a good move
its almost party time!
Thats cool. did you make plans?
I feel for parents whose kids dont start until september lol
Ive done that before.. it gets super dark on the highways and you dont realize it till you dont have any lights shining.
I had a similar problem where my car overheated in the middle of nowhere.. so you never know.. anything can happen
Was it something good or bad?
No way... Bigfoot himself?
Its okay... I believe you. The truth is out there.
I would be too!
Who knows maybe youll win
eat a snack
thats a good plan
i hope you have fun!
Why? What happened? I hope it was nothing really bad.
Oh no! Did you ever find your dog?
That is wonderful of you! She is going through a hard time financially?
That would be great! So many towns also have some great food banks too! We should always help eachother out
Why is it hard for you?
Well thats really great of you to be the bigger person in such a situation.
im so sorry to hear that
is she still alive?
wow where are you going!?
I can imagine how excited you are!  Are you visiting anyone or just going to go see the sights?
thats the time we live in now.... 
i think its going to continue to get worse before it gets better
I wish my sister felt that way about mine! lol. What kind of pets does she have?
They are very curious creatures. Very people friendly. What is their name?
oh thats an exciting time. is she excited?
were all forgetful sometimes.  I bet there were plenty of people who didnt have paperwork
I know the feeling. Why did you move
That sucks. I hope we never sell my grandmas home. Too many memories
dang thats messed up.. 
yea thats a lot of places now.. 
were you walking home?
oh yeah thats always sketchy
Holy Cannoli! Are you going to go check it out?
I hope everything is OK. You should probably go hide in the closet!
what are you going to get
that sounds like a good plan
Did you enjoy the quiet time?
Nice what did you have? I am so hungry right now.
Mmm I love lasagna. Wish I could have come too.
Im right there with you. Those were much simpler times
Yeah I dont know how our parents did it
I wish I could go and chillax anywhere
gonna move to a new place?
I am sure you will.. You seem to have studied hard last semester.
I failed a huge test last week.. for my English 612 certification
Wow. My hearty congratulations to you!
Yeah It is a proud moment.
oh no. im sure it was an accident. is he young?
i would have been upset for both reasons. especially after just having it cleaned
Always gotta have a spare
thats wonderful .. hope they continue to progress
yea thats understandable
What will you be doing this weekend
Dont club any seals 
Wow that sounds very dangerous. Were you afraid?
I totally feel. Gotta hate those jerks that are always cutting people off!
lol. Well I hope you had a car? Also I hope you got better friends
yea? whats the matter?
yea that part sucks
I hope you do. IS there a big pay raise
I dont know if thats good or not lol
did they catch you?
at least they didnt get you then!
That is the worst I hate that.
Thats no good why didnt you bring a friend with you?
Im sorry that happened. You deserve better friends than them anyway.
Oh boy sounds like a terrible time! Did you drink water?
Thats great that you got it repaired. Else your house wouldve been a sauna.
my dad used to play hand ball.it was very fun and interesting watching them play when i was a kid
yeah.it needs more exposure
Oh man that is the worst feeling. Did you have to wash the dishes?
Well at least you didnt have to walk out without paying. Good decision.
That sounds lonely. Why did you go alone?
That is really messed up. Was it at least a good movie?
That really sucks. Did you get in trouble?
Awwww thats terrible. I hope you find him!
Are you going to be able to get that money?
Are you having desperate times?
I think you need to go and talk to someone your pastor may be the best place to start.
I hear you! I am in that boat too! It can be very hard to be alone a lot
Those are NOT friends
What savages! Did you tell the drive through guy?
Im not sure but Im not liking where society is heading these days.
did you rub his nose in it
teach him a lesson!
I would be mad too. Did you find the culprit?
That really sucks. Are you going to get it fixed?
I hate when that happens... so many channels nothing to watch
Where are you going
That sounds fun
Oh thats so cool!
Thats a smart kid!
That sucks. Did you catch the culprit?
I would be too! Did you buy a new one?
grab your gun and take names.
sounds like you were pretty well prepared.  howd it go?
Awesome.  Great job.  What kind of job is it?
happy early birthday!
ARe you going to have a party?
Thats no good. Did he ever repay you?
What a jerk. I would take it to Judge Judy.
That seems like a nice memory
ITs nice remembering the good times
Awwww thats sad. Why is it your last day?
Well I suppose itll be a different experience. I am sure youll meet a bunch of new cool people.
Ive never been there did you enjoy it?
I think I need to go there everyone seems to love it.
I feel sorry for your friend.
That is such a terrible story.
That really sucks. Sounds like a regular ole Fidel Castro.
True. Kids always get up to no good at night!
MAybe she is sick
Do you honk your horn at them?
That is true. It is always better to be safe than sorry.
what movie did you see?
was it good? ive been wanting to check it out
That sounds horrible... Im sorry that happened to you
Ew no way! Lol
Nice! What are you planning on doing?
Sounds like the ultimate plan to me. I think I will do the same.
What was the instance? Something bad or good?
Whoa that is not cool. I would be so ticked off.
Did he turn around there and go and pick that on up?
You should inform the local police they will definately pick that person up!
Did you punish your dog?
Thats good.  Your dog will learn.
Nice! What color is it?
Yeah they arent too hard to put together. Theyre really fun too!
Oh no!  Is it a puppy or perhaps sick?
Perhaps she had an upset tummy or something.  Sometimes with dogs its hard to tell.
That sounds like fun! Where are you taking them? The junkyard?
Aw thats sounds like so much fun! You sound like awesome parents 
I love Madden I cant wait to play it!
I am so jealous!
whoa is the other woman more attractive?
how long have you been married?
MY crocodile always does that 
Get a prosthetic. I cant spell
What a tragedy! Did anyone say anything about it?
I am sure you did but at least you dont look crazy every day like I do.
HAHA that sounds just like my husband!
Well sometimes men tend to get lost in their video game world
Thats awesome! You must be a hard worker to be so confident!
Oh well in that case Im sure youll get it! He must have confidence in you too.
I am sure you will do well!
Just stay positive and everything will work out.
How do you think you did on it?
I am sure you did fine on it. And besides if you did poorly there is always the good ole local McDonalds.
I can understand that  I think all of us at one point or another did something we were ashamed of.  
I know that feeling kinda sick to your stomach cant get it out of your head kinda thing.  We all have to have a method to overcome it and move on.
Aw thats nice. Did they get along?
Oh god that is horrifying! I wouldve wanted to hide under a rock too!
I know what you mean I long for the day when mine grow up and go away to college.
They can be rambunctious mine drive me up the wall sometimes.
i know that feeling
Im sorry. It will happen til someone else soon enough
Oh man! Which one was it?
I saw that movie too! One of the scariest I have ever seen.
Are you prepared for it?
Absolutely thats the spirit!
Aw why is that? Is it acting up?
Why is that? The military isnt so bad. The pay is really nice if you stick around for a bit.
How do you think you are going to do?
I am confident you will do well!
Well thats great! Has she practiced enough to get her actual license?
Oh yes definitely. Its OTHER drivers you have to watch out for. People halfway pay attention to what theyre doing on the road!
That was very nice of you!  I wish more people would react the way that you did.
And thats all we really can do honestly if more people did that this world would be a better place all around.
I love pecan pie. My grandma used to make it
They can make their own pies
Yeah I know how that is. My kids eat me out of house and home.
Well kids do need to eat. They grow up so quickly.
That sounds revolting! What did you do?
Poor frog. May it rest in peace. I will pray for it tonight.
Are you going to get a new one?
Do you live near the Rockies?
That is good of you to support her.
You have a great family!
That is just gross!  Did you say anything to him like Dude what are you doing?
Well if youve ever seen Friends Rachel makes a trifle with whipped cream bananas jam and ground beef and peas!!
Is there some good news?
That is such a heartwarming story!
Do you feel as prepared as you can be for it?
Well that is a great attitude I bet you will do amazing!!
Oh no! Thats terrible
How did it even rollaway if its that huge?
Oh yeah? Thats pretty nice that you would help her out like that.
Wow that would make me mad too. What a devious scamp!
That is really sad and devastating. 
I am glad to hear he is doing better. 
thats great i hope you get it !
Money is always good and you will be near your son hopefully he does not find it embarrassing  u know how kids are    
Damn you are the MVP. I have only eaten two in a day. I am jealous.
Well maybe they should think about emigrating south. I heard the charter schools there are subpar.
Well kids eventually grow and become independent. Maybe you can try and go fishing with them or something? Or a family picnic?
That would work too! Or maybe a good meal?
Thats really not good. Did you feel bad about it?
Maybe you should see a counselor. Or just get out of the relationship.
So what did you do? Did you confront him?
I cant find words to describe my laughter right now. You are the best
What did you do for you?
That is such a bold move to make.  Congratulations!
Do you enjoy cooking for others or for the event you are taking it to?
I bet it will be great  Ive always loved a good tuna casserole!
Thats fantastic! Was anyone around to witness the glory?
You deserve a purple heart for the bravery you showed today.
Thats awesome congratulations!
You must be so proud of her
That would scare the heck out of me! How did you find out what it was?
What a crazy night! I bet you didnt get much sleep.
Is your dog still a puppy?
Im sure she will grow out of it.
Oh wow. What for?
I would hope so. That was a very generous gesture on your part.
Thats so nice! Did they have a good day?
Thats good. Its nice when everything turns out great in the end.
wow. in the middle of the week. you mustve really been surprised
Oh wow! Congratulations! How much did you pay for the ticket?
Oh wow! I bet youll have that 99 in no time so you can buy another! Good job!
Friggin Becky! Why would she do such a thing!
Yeah! Get even and slap that jerk in the face with the shoes she bought!
Oh thats terrible. Is he okay?
Thats bad but really good that he is fine! I am very glad for both you and him.
Eww!  I hope you were able to miss it and not drive over it
Yeah I certainly do not envy the person that has to clean those things up!  
congratulations. what are you having?
i have two girls and a boy
Wow that is so nice!
Why? What was the problem?
I had the same problem.
Thats a responsible decision on your part. Are you nervous about it?
Thats good. I am sure he will turn out happy and healthy!
That really sucks. Did you find it?
Thats really good! Was all your money in there?
Okay. are you preparing now?
Dont worry. You can do well. Hope you score well.
Oh wow. Did everything turn out okay?
Well I am so glad it turned out okay! Especially since your daughter is healthy and kicking. Congrats 
Wow how exciting!!  Its been a long time since Ive had a birthday party  are you going anywhere special?
OOOO I love gifts!!!  I know its never about the gift but ok it is SO nice to get presents!!
While I understand the motives behind your deception I must caution that it may catch up with you one day. How did you do it?
Thats OK. Everyone makes mistakes just study hard and dont do it again in the future.
was it on a scratch off?
thats awesome! i need some of that luck
Oh cool for what console?
Yes but for Xbox one.
Oh no I hope she wasnt your ride homw
Thats happened to me before... not fun
Oh cool! Where are you guys going?
That sounds like fun! Beach days are the best days!
Do you think you will tell the professorteacher about it?
Oh geez. Did you get any tears in your eye?
Awww thats so sweet. I remember when my little girl was taking tap dance classes. So precious!
You have a pet armadillo?
I hope it gets potty trained.
Nice! Have you gone cruising in it yet?
I would be too. Thats a nice car!
Congratulations! Have you decided on a name yet?
That sounds wonderful. Im happy for you and your new daughter!
Aww Im sorry for your loss. How is your family holding up?
Yeah it sounds like she did take advantage. Thats a cruel thing to do.
I love pickles and I always order extra!  We must be twins!
6?? How is that EXTRA?  12  that would be extra  crazy!!!
It seems like a nice way to relax
I will try that when the weather is cooler
That really sucks. Maybe you should force feed him some melatonin?
Oh well hopefully that works. Wouldnt want you up all night!
Nice what was the occasion?
That is a great thing. I wish I had a girlfriend like that.
Thats really terrible. Are you going to get a new one?
Thats a good idea. Or I would adopt one. I adopted two from PetsMart and it only cost me 15 bucks!
Im sorry does that happen often?
I hope they treat you better in the future.
Oh no! What did you do? Are you going to dispute it?
Well thats a relief! Wouldnt want the IRS to seize your house!
Ive never used one.  How did it work out for you?
I can understand that!  Its crazy how scary things can be out there now and the news does not help at all!  But Im glad you are safe!!
I love horses! Has she been riding a long time?
Oh no! Im glad she was okay!
did you get to try some good food?
Oh which series is it?
Good. I hope you enjoy the game and play well.
Oh no! Im sure it didnt do it on purpose
Nice! If it pays more then why wouldnt you take it?
Gotta put up with some discomfort to make dat bank.
monsters under the bed?
I used to believe they were in my closet too
Oh yeah? When are you heading over?
Yeah I guess it is kinda jerkish of them. I would give the ole copparoos a call so you can get some sleep.
That is such a bizarre story.
I hope it gets resolved.
wow who sent it to you?
thats really nice are yall friends?
oh i know the feeling. its good they are down to earth though
That has always bothered me as well.  I mean how much effort does it take to just wave as a thank you?
People do not seem to have much of it these days unfortunately.  I promise if you ever let me out Ill wave.
That sounds so cool! Did you find any good ones?
Thats so nice. Any in particular that you liked?
Woo good luck!
Its good you studied!
I love fried twinkies you will too!
I am so excited for you!
did you do it bare foot ? that is nasty i dont own pets at all but i can imagine your situation 
its really stinky i have smelled it before 
Oh no! I bet it was a huge poop! What did you do with it?
Well thats what he gets for pooping on the rug! He knew better!
That sounds like a very fond memory that brings back a lot of nostalgia. Where would he take you?
That sound so relaxing. I wish I had parents to do that with.
lol how did the guests react?
thats embarrassing! gotta love pets
Madden is a fun game My husband plays it a lot instead of paying attention to me.
See you know whats up! I need you to hang out with my husband so itll rub off on him!
Dang! Did the guy get hurt?
Almost makes me want to become the next Steve Irwin. Id be better than him because there aint no way that I would let a stupid stingray end my life!
You have a lemur as a pet?
I am sorry about your situation.
What does she do thats so bad?
Yeah she sounds terrible.
I dont blame you.  I dont like giving out money like that  you just never know what they may do with it.
Well like I said you couldnt be sure that she would use it in a good way.  She could have bought alcohol etc.. with it.  What I usually do is if they are asking for money for food I will go and buy them a meal or go get them some groceries that arent perishable.
Did you have fun at least?
Oh Im sorry to hear that
Thats great! Is it a boy or a girl?
Thats so nice! What are you going to name her?
Well I think youre gonna do a great job on it
You got this homie! I bet youre gonna get an A!
Awww poor dog! Did you give it a treat to make it up?
Well I am sure he can tell youre sorry by your actions. Doggies are smart like that!
Oh cool whats in it?
Ah man I built my own computer about a year ago...it had like 10 important expensive parts and I had to wait for them all!
That is an awesome phone!
If you have a tracking number you should be okay.
Well youre a good man. Not many of yall out there these days.

Oh Im so sorry to hear that
Were you close?

Well I hope it doesnt happen again. And I hope you find out who did it and give them an earful!
Congratulations!  I am so happy for you!
That will be quite an adventure!
Thats a dang shame. Have you said anything to him about it?
That would boil my blood. You just gotta smack him upside the head!
shame on him. How did you find out?
Did he receive a failing grade?
Thats too bad. Why do you think she is doing that?
Those dastardly kids! I hope she grows out of it eventually.
Ive been there before!  Do you ever remember the stuff that you do?
Oh no!  I hope it wasnt too embarrasing!

I bet youll have a great time
Do you think you will get it?
Thats wonderful! Im sure you are an excellent candidate!
Thats great that you have so much confidence.  What classes do you have?
Those easy semesters help when you know youve got some harder ones on the horizon.  Good Luck!
how did your daughter take it
I bet they are! Youre a lucky man!
It is. Mine are all grown now and its like they grow up right before your eyes in a blink.
awesome! what kind?
whoa that is an awesome ride! what color?
Does she compensate you or anything like that?
Will she not repay the favor at all?
Did he get it?
Well at least it wasnt all for nothing
You should hire someone to do that.
Do you think they will return it if they borrow it?
I wouldnt let them borrow it. Who has time for all that?
Oh my heavens how long ago was that?
Its cool that you experienced that. I love going to the movies!
Oh no Im so sorry. I love cats
At least the cat lived a good life by your side
work is such a drag. the time we lose from it we never get back
people are just like that. our childhood is gone and we have to fend for ourselves now
I hear thats an amazing show but Ive never seen it before
They sound really scary I hope I never see one!
it will. i hope i am long gone
maybe i will be a zombie!
awww. boy or girl
Well a happy healthy baby is the best kind
I know what you mean I love it so much. Whos your favorite character?
Im teamjonsnow til the bitter end!
My parents had difficulties conceiving as well. What happened in the end?
Thats so good to hear! I am actually adopted myself and I love my family so much.
Why ddi it need to rain today?
Was the weather nice instead?
What is your favorite show?
Maybe you should watch some Netflix.
Has he done something to make you want to break up with him?
Well if you know hes not the one its better to do it now than years from now.
what is that?
I have never seen that show but I have heard of it.
I do not watch a lot of TV.
ive been there lol
thats too far away
Raising children is hard to say the least. What did she lie about most recently?
Well thats a relief. It actually sounds fairly amusing!
Oh no!  Did you call your bank and file a fraud charge?
At least you stopped it at 100.  Ive heard of others that have lost thousands until the bank could recover it for them.
That is such a noble gesture!
They will promote you someday dont give up.
It can be scary out there alone.
Thats too bad. I hope things turn around for you soon.
well as long as youre happy
Who is conducting the tests?
How long does the test take?
You and me both
tell me about it
Does it bring back memories?
That is so sweet.
wow. thats amazing
I am shocked either way.
i know right
now that summer break is over every week will be like that for me
Oh really? Whats bothering you about it?
Ah that is different. I cant remember a time in school that I didnt have a backpack on me.
Wow! What did you eat and how much did you spend?
I am sure it was excellent and not raw!
i had one parent like that
What did they do for you to hate them?
Have you ever tried to use UPS?
I am sure you feel better now that you did it.
Yes and now you can cook without germs.
That feeling is not alien to me. Had been through it in the past. It is truly frustrating looking for new favorite restaurant
I hope you would be able to find a new one as a replacement for your favorite dining place
Oh Im sorry to hear that.
what are you guys going to do?
Thats interesting. What kind of weird things?
What a wacko! I hope she grew out of it.
I love meeting new people.
Have you ever talked to a doctor about it?
are you gonna stay there for ever
that seems like a long time
I love taco bell what did you get?
I always get a bean burrito.
That sounds so exciting!
I wish you the best of luck!
I have a daughter but she isnt married yet. 
Thats nice but I wonder if it was expensive.  My daughter is one of these millennials that opt for a livein partner. 
I had a blast in high school. I wish I could go back.
Too bad we couldnt use a time machine.
I really hate that too. It just hurts.
Same here. Its better in the long run if you dont I believe.
That is great. Did you buy him a present for graduation?
What did your brother study?
Why did you do that?
I hope you had fun at least.
Was your friend drunk?
Have you spoke to him since?
sounds like fun
Hey call of duty bets starts tomorrow for xbox
I am also single. I love it.
Were you ever married in the past?
Well trying to compare yourself to the former president is a bit of a jump
Thats fair. Maybe some acting classes would help you loosen up.
That must of been horrible.
I do not drink alcohol at all.
what did they do?
Ive vream works wonders
That is a very bold move.
Thats a real shame! You going to do anything about it?
I would feel the same way. I hope it gets taken care of.
I love Nintendo. What game did you play?
I love Super Mario.
Me neither. I get very tense at those times. Were you in one recently?
Oh no thats horrible. I bet that was a scary experience.
wow what makes them happy?
aha let them have fun
How many did the dog have?
Are you going to keep all of them?
Oh congrats! When is the due date?
That is coming up soon!
Well you know how kids are. Probably just forgot and was embarrassed 
Well be gentle but firm. Too much and you will scare her more then likely. 
Trust me she probably already knows she made the mistake. Just teach her not to do it again.
What happened on the date
A pro game?
oh thats nothing
Did you keep it or try to find the owner?
Did you spend it yet?
No you will never be alone.
What kind of card game was it? I am not even good enough to cheat most of the time.
Ah yes I have but it has been a while. 
What is making you feel bummed out?
Can you do anything fun inside?
Do you know who it was?
I hope you do!
Confidence is the golden key to success.
Hey socks are fair game  cant be mad about socks.
Yeah  guess thats true  But im always running out of socks.
Did you at least get it back?
Did you have to fight anyone for it?
that sucks why did you do it?
that is such a bomber i can relate to thinking you are right but then turning out top be wrong
Where are you going on your road trip?
I love Denver I go every summer.
He stole your car!! did you call the cops?
Good Did he actually come back with it though.
What was he doing in there?
How old is your brother?
Yes! love is an amazingly powerful thing.
That is amazing I truly hope that happens.  you deserve it.
Oh Did you check whats it?
Yeah Its better to ignore.
Yes! more money more fun right!
Oh really?!?!? why is that?
There really is nothing sweeter than childhood memories. Have you ever been back to that park?
I am so sorry to hear that. I hope he gets better!
Youre a monstor!
I cant lie I have done worse before.
Is your puppy still around?
That sucks did you ever find him?
Yes he will! your support is probably very important to him.
Amazing He will pull through with the right amount of support.
What trick did you teach him?
That is good do you plan to teach him more tricks?
do you feel confortable in the new contry? maybe you should download an app to meat people
i can understand my work does not allow me to do much as well
Yes! did you help her study?!
Thats amazing you are probably the best teacher she could have asked for.
Did you do it?
Was the water cold or hot?
Taylor swift is actually amazing she is my guilty pleasure.
Yes! I think she is coming to my city soon!
What were the pictures of?
Haha Id say so. What was your excuse to her?
Thats a good strategy always when dealing with wives I think.
Yes! what was it!??!
Bluetooth speakers are actually one of my favorite inventions.
Why?? what happened to her!?
That is so terrible! was this recent? if you dont mind me asking
Did you go see a doctor?
How long will it take to get rid of the fungus?
Thats fantastic. How did you do?
Congratulations! Sounds like your hard work really paid off!
Really? did something trigger this?!?
Do you get sick very often!?
When are you going to look?
Hopefully you did well. How many classes did you have?
Did you Dad stick around?
But did you ebd up getting a good grade?
I mean sometimes you have to do what you have to do.
Why not?!! is he mean to you?
That is terrible Yard work is mild torture.
Why is that? Do you not like the train?
Have you ever tried to distract yourself while on the train?
Did the dog look like he was having fun?
Did you take a video of it?
Thats amazing who bought it for you?
Thats amazing getting a new car can change your life!
that sucks is she really your friend then?
but still if she is only using you i dont think she is some one you need to be around just saying
The evidence of what?
Did you get in trouble with anyone?
Me to! cowbays all day baby.
Why not!?! americas team!
It is good to have a open relationship with your parents.
Do you have the same relationship with your Dad?
Yes you will! I believe in you!
Hahaha! me too! i cant even trust an alarm.
Youve got me on the edge of my seat. What did you do?
Im so sorry to hear that! I hope you two can work it out.
Thats great. Where are you going?
Good for you buddy!
Thats the spirit! you can do It I know you can
How does that make you feel?!
Have you ever thought hes chirping because he doesnt want to be caged up? Maybe she wants to be out with you. 
Thats amazing! are you ready for your journey
No I dont I really want to one day I think i would be good at it.
Oh thats horrible. Were you okay?
Yes thats the most important part. You were lucky!
Awe thats so sweet! how long have you worked there?
Thats amazing! I would feel so loved if someone did that for me I never get attention like that.
Oh how exciting. Ive never been on a cruise
Ive never been to Mexico. Have fun

You thought? what was really happeneing
LOL I honestly would have been screaming 
sorry about that horror movies can be scary
You can have someone watch with you next time
What kind of classes have you taken?
Thats great that you are learning a martial art and blowing off steam at the same time!
Did she taught him to use the bathroom?
Did it made a mess?
Thank goodness! I hope he was not hurt too bad?
Yes I can only imagine! Thank goodness he wasnt and that he will be ok!
What happened? Was it the dog?
I knew it. Nasty. lol. Its happened to me too
yah truly hard work pays
Wowgood for you. It seems greater things are lined up for you.
That shows someone is looking up for some of your interest. Maybe next could be a promotion.How knows??
Oh Im sorry. That must suck. Any second choice?
Im sure youll get in
I did but not officially and it was a trail running marathon16 miles how about you?
You are the only one who know answer to that.
hahaha..that is too funny. did anyone else hear?
wow! it happens. i have heard it before
Oh that sounds amazing was it a good thing?
What a nice girlfriend you have did you liked them?
I am sorry to hear that what were they doing with the money?
I bet you were very angry with them over this.
Were you in a rock band than?
I bet it was fun how is your hearing now?
They love you dont they?
I see. So you miss them. Call them?
What good news! You must be very proud of her.
Thats great that you can celebrate her success so wholeheartedly! You are a good sibling.
That sounds scary. I couldnt sleep with that.
Perhaps its deer? Thats what its been in my experience.
OMG. Did anyone else notice?
lol. Well perhaps you got away with it this time
why is that? they are not real! 
that is the point! haha
That can be pretty lonely I bet. Are you going to have another roommate then?
I see. Maybe having some private time will be a benefit if you look on the brighter side of it.
Do you play?
If you have a favorite team I hope they have a good season! 
Dont you worry your tomorrow might be great. Just take it each day at a time.
They say problems shared is halved solved. I wish you the very best. Remember never give up in life.
i hope you get the job!
Oh I hate wasps. Did you get it out?
Id get some spray or a flyswatter and prepare for battle.
Amazing! Congratulations. Was it fun?
I love parties
oh my! does she know it is broken?
it wasnt intentional ....still a horrible feeling
Oh my I am sorry to hear that. are you angry at her?
I agree you have done the right thing. I hope you find someone alot better than her.
Well thats intriguing. What was in it? 
What an unexpected treat! I bet it really made your day!
You and me both! Nothing wrong with making some more bread!
Congratulations! What position are you interviewing for?
Not just working for yourself but helping others too. Good on you!
Thats nice of you. It means he can get back on his feet.
Its good to have a fixed address too for mail etc. Well done  Im proud of you.
was it a real disaster or just seem like one?
hahah.. sounds bad
Nice are you looking forward to it?
Its always a good idea to enjoy the outdoors. So have fun!
So sad.Make a call to her and speak.
Its good idea. Take care both of you!
im sorry to hear that. what was the job?
i love those type of jobs
Did anyone notice?
Maybe its Karma  you deserved free soda
Oh that will be fun Im sure! What is your favorite part of camping?
That is wonderful! Yall should build a fire and roast some marshmallows! My family would always do that while singing songs. 
You must have really impressed the company you work for. Got any plans for the money?
Either of those choices sounds good. Enjoy the fruits of your labor!
oh man!! tell me about it. that is the thing i hate the most also!
i dont blame you.i also feel like telling them something. but i hold my tongue
What did he make?
Thats great! Did he enjoy doing it?
oh god what are you going to do now?
good luck with that! 
Im jealous! That must have put you in a good mood. Its cloudy and rainy over this way. 
I stay optimistic. You seem motivated or excited for some reason.
A true American right of passage. How does the memory make you feel?
Cheers from across the pond! It truly is a magical place.
What did he give you
Sounds fun I love sushi.
im glad you enjoyed it  what did you have?
that sounds really good
Oh wow. Did you have butterflied in your stomach! 
I bet you were excited to find out!
Probably just some bored teens. Still what a mess to clean up!
Sounds like you are going to have a stake out. Good luck!
Its stressful  how did you get on?
when does it start?
you must be really excited
Nice. Is there a special occasion?
Good. A haircut always makes me feel more confident
Sounds like a great day to relax then! What will you do?
Nice you should just snuggle in and binge your favorite tv shows.
Im so sorry! I bet you were terrified! What happend?
Yeah I hope everything turned out ok. Thats worrisome to me. 
How are you feeling about the interview?
What is the job?
Thats inconsiderate. Have you spoken to her about it yet?
Maybe you need to do the same to get even with her
How come? What made you so angry.
Ugh I dislike parents who are so irresponsible with their kids in public
Im sure youll be fine. Sell yourself.
Im sure that will help. I have confidence in you.
what was on it
oh that sounds nice
Why? Is it a dangerous area?
Yeah  that can be frightening
Oh man! Are you gonna be ok? I hope your not devastated about this. 
Wow. You need to go see the doctor to help you get some rest. I bet your exhausted. 
what do you plan to do about it?
Me too. What are your plans?
Cool. I might do that too
Why? What do you have on?
Lol  peace and quiet?
how did it get in?
oh thats crazy
Are you frusterated with the old one or just hopeful for a new begining?
I bet you are very worried or anxious. Do you need any help with anything?
i can see that!
Nice did you feel caring since you did so well?
You should take care of the pet more often in the future.
Are you? Have you applied to a lot of place?
Good I hope you land one soon!
you must have enjoyed yourself
am happy you did
Good  its always best to be prepared. Are you confident?
I hope so!
Nice you must be really anticipating it. Which soccer league will you watch?
Sounds good today Ill be watching my favorite team play. I am also anticipating the match.
Yes they take on Leicester City
Oh my do you feel content with all that sugar in your body?
Its okay you should treat yourself every now and then!
Its hard. But you will see him soon and nowadays tehre are lots of ways to communicate
Soon youll remember all the mess he made or food he ate and be a little bit glad 
i bet you were frustrated with them. Did you confront them?
I agree. Im sorry for that. I hope they didnt get you too sad. Maybe they thought it wsa theirs for some reason
I agree. Go talk to them and express your frusteration and anger with them. Maybe he will get it. 
Oh no! Did it attack you?
You can always call an exterminator. They should be able to take care of it.
Excellent!I love parties
I hope so  good luck
whats the appointment for
ah i hope it goes well!
Oh no! Do you know who did it?
Wow I would be upset too if I were you.
Thats exciting! Do you have a favorite team?
Cool. That sounds exciting. I hope they do well this year!
Really??!!? Can you lend me some money?
Neither am I. Well done! Remember your friends like me
put it on offerup
I would be too. What was the hold up for?
I see you should try yoga to relieve the stress. 
That mustve been nice. Ive never been.
Im sure it is. Maybe Ill visit too
Realy?! What did you do?
Good job! you must be so proud of yourself.
Hey if youre passionate about it then go for it!
Wow thats terrifying maybe next time u should invest in mouse traps 
Understandable thats very unfortunate hopefully they will disappear from your home 
Congrats! That would be pretty exciting. Do you have any plans for it?
That sounds like a good plan. How big is your garden?
Nice! How do you pick your numbers?
Thats cool. Good luck with your ticket!
what movie was it
oh yea that was creepy
Oh no. Was it an important meeting?
Im sure its not as bad as you think
Sorry to hear that. It must make you feel very lonely 
I suppose there has to be a balance of both. To enjoy solitude and the company of others.
Interesting. What was in it?
Cool! Did you eat all of it yet?
Nice. I wish someone would send me a package like that!
Cool! Id love to be patient like that
Well done to her. I  hope she enjoys the reward
time fof a beat down?
Nice what pet was it?
Sounds very exquisite. You must have cared for it well.
That would be very scary! Were you able to find some clothes?
Thats probably the best solution to the problem.
Did you manage to make it on time?
Good job! It must have been stressful.
Have you prepared well for it?
Nice be sure to shave and be confident!
Yeah   get that sometimes too
I see do you think you will get the job?
Good you must have prepared well for it.
Really? Was it a ghost?
Its lovely. Why did you take care?
Oh its good that you take care of them.
well that stinks for you but good for him
im glad to hear that!!! hard work pays off!!
im very proud of you and the hard work you put in
I dont think you should. Those are often scams.
Usually if you feel that way it is. Try to research alternate cures that actually will work better.
Wow did it scare you?!
So am I I would have freaked out if I saw it my bedroom.
I dont mind that  does it freak you out
But you survived.
Yeah  the prices vary a lot
Im not sure. I think it depends on the dates you want
No Ive never been there either.
I just Googled it. It does seem beautiful online. Maybe that could be next years trip!
as you should 
sounds like a pain! Do you know who did it?
Hm I hope its not too costly to fixed!
That sucks! Im sure it hurt your feelings.
Oh wow. I cant believe your friend did that to you. 
Im sure it can be. Maybe talk to him about it.
Did it wake you up? I would have been so scared.
Ha! Just next time make sure you close all the windows before going to bed!
Oh no. Was it a important speech?
As King Solomon in the bible would say This will pass
Oh sad. What did happen?
He shouldnt do this. Is that your dog fine now?
Thats really disgusting. Im sorry to hear that.
Well hopefully youll be able to get the puppy trained pretty soon.
that is awesome! goes to show that hard work DOES pay off!! congrats!
that type of news makes me really happy
Good luck! I hope you find something good!
How have you been searching?
Im sue shell get over it. Your wife wouldnt.
Congratulations! What is he going to do now?
That must be lonely. Do you try to make friends?
I am sorry to hear that. Luckily you can always call them.
Yeah. Its tough sometimes. But maybe taught her a valuable lesson?
what type of job you looking for ?
Really? Thats awful. Hopefully they understand taht you werent really yourself.
Dont be too hard on yourself. Everyone makes mistakes.
Sorry to hear that. Were they busy or did they forget?
You should not rely on her next  time. She seems unreliable! 
Wow you must have been so surprised! Your parents are so nice.
Well its a nice shock! I wish someone would give me a surprise for once!
Im very sorry to hear that. Im hear for you if you need someone.
I can understand the feeling. But being single is great that you dont have to constantly worry about someone else.
hahaha...ive been there and i have done that...what kind of cookies?
ohhh...fancy i dont blame you then. i would have eaten them all too
Congratulations! You must be very happy. Have you met him yet?
Does he have a name?
That sounds exciting! Will you be meeting your old friends there?
Really? That would be pretty fun. Ive never heard about my high school having a reunion.
Oh no thats horrible. Did he even ask?
Thats awful. Im sorry that happened to you. Maybe karma will come around on your boss.
What was in the parcel?
That sounds delicious! I wish someone would send me a package like that.
Wow  Ive nver been but would love to go.
Definitely. And it never rains in Southern CAlifornia.
I see I feel like that sometimes too when my kids leave for college. 
did he do anything?
probably did the wrong thing.. up to no good.
Excellent. Hows it been going?
Great  Im glad
Do you play soccer or watch it on television?
Really? What sort of package are you expecting?
i would have been fine with that grade too. are you doing well in the class?
i can relate to that. all that matters is you passed
Thats very exciting. Have you decided to get one for sure?
Yes its good to be prepared. Im sure when you do get one he will become a part of the family.
Oh wow! How were they?
Guess you wont be hungry for while
Oh no  how embarrassing. What did you do?
oh no.. is she ok ?
i hope all goes well
Thats great! Dod you have any plans for the weekend?
Oh thats horrible. You can always watch a movie or something indoors.
hard work pays off 
Cool! Thats great news. Do you have any fun plans?
Sounds like fun! Id love to be able to do that. But I get to work all weekend.
that is the worst. i am sorry to hear that.
those medical bills do add up. i wish we didnt have to pay so much to keep ourselves healthy
That is good to have new challenges.
It will be fine. Switching jobs can be scary at first sometimes
Well its not in your hands anymore so its best to stay calm and not worry about it now.
As it should but a bad grade is not the end of the world.
Oh wow! Im really sorry to hear that. That must have been shocking. Have you broken up now?
Oh I can understand the feeling. You should take some time for yourself before you try to do much else.
That is so nice.
Oh thats really disgusting! Did you still eat there?
Good. They dont deserve your business. You should report it to the department of health too.
Oh I would be mad at them too! Do you know who it was?
Oh that sucks. You might be able to get the scurity camera footage.
She shouldnt have done that without asking you. But maybe there is an opportunity here for you...
Maybe you can experiment with other women with your wife? Could be fun
Were they good memories or bad memories?
Thats a very strong reaction. Still it must have been really pleasant for you.
Oh do they scare you a lot?
Oh me too actually. They are too scary for me too
Oh good luck on it! Are you studying?
Then Im sure youll do fine. Just try your hardest!
Did you catch them doing it?
I would be upset if that happened to me too.
hopefully it turns out well
You must have thanked him for it. He is a smart brother!
Good on you. Your brother should consider being a teacher! 
Yeah it can be tough to throw things out that remind us of special people. I still have some toys my grandma gave me when I was a baby.
Yes I do. It can be one of the few remaining physical reminders of the person.
Oh that would be really frustrating. Have you tried to do anything about it?
Im not sure if you could train bees. You can get one of those protective suits I guess.
That is terrible. Did you tried calling him?
That is very bad person. You should forget about him.
You must be feeling so anxious yet so excited right now!
You need to keep a cool head though try doing some sports to relax your mind.
Wow! Thats an amazing accomplishment! You must be so proud of him!
Thats really great for him. Maybe he should try out for the olympics?
That is great! How did it turn out?
Im sure it wont be long until your hard work is rewarded
Sounds amazing! Are you going any place in particular?
Beaches are fun! I dont even know the last time Ive been to a beach.
that could not always be a good thing
it is nice when it happens
Yes that is incredibly annoying! Im a quiet person by nature so that can drive me carzy quite fast!
Yes I feel like yelling at them  But thats just something that I would never actually be able to do!
You must be so surprised! Technology has really advanced in the last few years.
Yep my son just got me an iPhone 8 and I was surprised at how alien it was to me.
Oh no that must have been embarrassing... but it happens.
Wow you might have gotten a little bit of trauma from it. But Im sure it will fade from memory eventually.
That is terrible. Probably he wanted money to buy drugs.
It could be a good explanation but he shouldnt have cursed.
What!? Did they steal anything?
Thats no good. Those windows are not cheep either. Hopefully it wont cost too much. 
Its exciting that you will be able to reconnect with an old friend. I understand that youre nervous though!
Im sure once you see each other and get to chatting it will be like no time has passed! Have fun!
That must have been very scary! Did you investigate it?
lol yeah our minds can play tricks on us when were nervous. Im glad it was nothing serious though.
Get yourself some good food and watch a movie! Sometimes its good to take some time for yourself
I get you Ive been in your situation before
That sounds like so much fun! I think you should. I love roller coasters!
Ive been on so many. Theyre definitley worthwhile! At least in my opinion!
I bet your chances are high. Party at a friends or family?
cool well i hope you get what you want 
Im so sorry about that. That must have really been horrible for her... and you
Wow that often. That must really be stressful.
Parties are so much fun! Are you celebrating anything special or is the party just a get together?
Sounds like a good time! Have fun at the party!
Oh good luck! I hope youre able to win.
I can imagine. Going through the process is very stressful. Do you have an attorney representing you at least?
That is a nice surprise! Did you get charged more later?
I wouldnt either. Lucky day for you!
That really sucks. You can always look into new housing options.
Well do you have enough room to bring in a roomate?
Oh no! and you cant go with her?
Oh ok well shell be back before you know it!
Oh really? That must have been very exciting to get!
That sounds really entertaining. Ive seen those fun coffee mugs with shapes at the bottom.
That sounds exciting! I hope you did well.
Im hoping for you! I always got stressed out waiting for grades too. Despite knowing that I did well.
Oh no thats annoying indeed.
Im sure they wanted to be there though. Hopefully they are thinking of you.
Oh no! Thats a terrible way to start your day. Did you still go to work?
Well at least you managed to make it through the day. I probably would have just gone home.
that sounds like so much fun!!! staying the night over the weekend? 
Sounds even better than bc I need a bed to sleep! lol 
That is always a bit embarrassing.  Did you blush? 
That is pretty funny to be honest.
Oh wow! That must have been a really scary experience. What happened to the spider?
Its a good thing that he was there to take care of it. I just saw a tarantula exhibits at the zoo. Even through the windows that made me nervous.
Oh no! Are you able to retake it?
Oh Im really sorry to hear that. Was it a big lie?
Thats a pretty serious issue. You should punish him somehow.
Like something out of a movie! my god. Did you nail it? 
I am sure you did! 
am sorry about that you could have reminded them perharps
yah next time remind them earlier so you dont feel disturbed
Wow thats funny! 
Thats nice. You guys can bond over it
Excellent! Convey my congrats to her. 
Motivate her to participate in more competition like this.
Im so sorry for your loss. Did you have it long?
You didnt keep it in a cage? Maybe you can get another and keep it more secure. 
oh no are you planning to get another one ?
what kind of breed was it
i agree with that.every day is a new start
yes we all do. i really fell you on that
i love listening to oldies. music now isnt as good as it used to be! memories right 
yes they are luckily we will always have them! 
LOL! Oh no were you able to change right away?
At least it was water and not coffee or juice
Ah that must have been nostalgic. Did you grow up with your cousin?
I see. Its really good you got to catch up though!
Oh really what was the ad about ?
That would be so fun i have always wanted to go but havent had the time !
Thats good to hear. Did you sell the old one to help pay on the new one?
Well at least you got a new car that doesnt break down.
Wow! Thats a great achievement. You must really be proud.
Thats great. Sounds like she has a bright future ahead of her.
That could be an unsettling situation.
I hope you had one. That is scary. Are you ok?
Do you live in a house or an apartment?
yeah that was good to helping others. it was a go9d manner i loved it.
yeah it was quite appriciated
Do you have a topic to discuss?
I can understand that. Its usually either parents are happy they are out of the house or sad that theyre gone. Im sorry you feel lonely. 
I can understand that. Kids have a big presence and their energy creates a void. Hopefully you can find things to take your mind off of it. 
Yes it is. My youngest has been away all this week for his first summer camp. Its been both awesome and lonely. 
Oh wow! what did you do?
Thank goodness for that! 
So then what did you do?
Yeah thats pretty crappy for sure!
Oh no! Hopefully there isnt a mess to clean up when you get back.
Maybe next time you will remember! Haha.
Oh no! When I misplace things I try to retrace my steps. Have you tried that?
Uh oh...I have a cat who likes to steal things too lol Try checking underneath the furniture.
That must be fun for them.  Our neighbor hood only has older people so my kids stay around the house.
See and i would have though the opposite but I suppose if they are gone all the time it might get overdone.
Yeah I can see that being an issue.  I guess your not as lucky as I was first initially thinking.  Im like you a home body.
That is crazy! He must have got a loan.
He probably wont be able to! Time will tell.
You mean tortures?
it was good habit i like it
that was really bad
Did you try to help them?
There is nothing you can do then.
Is that a prince album?
Well give it back  Stealing is not right
What happened? Did you uncle drove over the speed limit?
That is horrible. He could have even crashed the car by being drunk. How could you let him drive
Oh that is quite strange I hope nothing has happened to them.
Yea I would find that rude as well if he cares about the relationship he should apologize or make it up.
What airplane? Did you know someone on it?
That is really sad. Where was it at?
What kind of car did you buy?
Did you get an insurance check?
Oh no! Thats a tough change but I suppose youll have to try to join clubs and make new ones!
Its harder as an adult but you can make some by joining some adult clubs that focus on sports or recreation. Or if you have a neighborhood club joining that!
When will you show your boss the design?
That is a smart move by you.
Thats really impressive! What do you like about it?
That does sound really exciting. 
Thats just the best i have to plan one of these this fall with my wife
I understand  it feels good but when you are away you keep thinking about home and the kids lol
Thats strange. Did you?
Did he walk away afterwards?
Yeah I understand
Oh god..well I hope she left you and youve learned that no one likes a betrayer
Thats disturbing kiddo..you lied and betrayed then you left. You have much to learn about life and how to treat others
Oh cool what was the research about? 
Thats interesting Im not sure I even knew there were different types of caffeine. Is one type worse than the others? 
How long have you been with your boyfriend?
Thats a long time so sorry to hear about your troubles.
Wow so close to being out on her own are you a bit nervous? 
Very sad but think of how proud she is going to make you in the good she will be just fine.
That is so true. I feel the same way. Its just nice to know that you work hard for your money.
i have been slacking but thats only because i moved i have to start back up
they are offering a free pass at my gym might take it up
It must be nice to have a house
I am sure it does
I bet. That always happens to me. At least its gone now for you
You are excited about this or??
I am sorry to hear that. I hope things get better for you
I completely understand! They scare me and I become like a little girl! The rat snakes are great though...I would never hurt them..but I dont want them near me or in eye vision! lol
LOL! omg..I use that word I didnt think anyone else did! That is the perfect word for it. I saw a tarantula in the pet store the other day and my skin jumped off of me
wow so happy you got it all done must feel nice right
that does sound like a lot of stuff going on at once
Oh I bet. Was it your first grandchild?
What a great day that must have been for you.
What will you do on vacation?
Will you stay in a condo on the beach?
That sounds so relaxing! Youll probably sleep great.
That is awesome what was the play about did kids perform? 
I heard of Hamlet thats the one about the prince right I would enjoy to see that being played out in the future glad you enjoyed it. 
Yes the cable company is infuriating. Do they eventually help you though?
Thats awful.  That definitely is the worst.  Maybe its time to change companies.
I am sorry about that. What kind of keys?
Oh wow! That stinks. At least you got new keys
Nostalgic feelings can be nice! I hope you didnt feel sad
Thats great! Have you moved out of state?
That would annoy me so much. Can you take it up with management?
What a tough situation. Just make sure and document everything.
What a great accomplishment! I can understand why youd be happy about that.
You should be really proud of that.
What happen did he make it?
Damn that sucks 😒
Oh wow why would she think you stole the money?
Would she have any reason not to trust you?  I would assume you have not done anything like this before.
Oh god that is horrible! Look in too Bitter apricot and also Chlorella if she does radiation..both have research done on them to help a LOT with cancer.
I can imagine! I have been through it with others. It is terrifying!
Could you purchase one from a local store?
I see online is such a convenience but if things get delayed or dont work it becomes an issue.
A race with running or with cars?
As long as you trained hard and did your best that is what counts!
Oh no!  Have you had any luck?
That must be so scary.  Im really glad you have some good options to try.
Well hopefully you are a guy? I know how you feel it feels great to lose weight!
How much weight did you lose? I have lost over 100lb before. Does feel awesome
oh i thought you were eating out
Did your boss understand at least?
Thats true. I would be mad about that as well
Im sorry to hear that. Have you had your cat a long time?
I bet it has. They become a part of the family and it can be hard to let go
Did you invite him?
Wow! I bet you had a good time though at your party
will it start you think
i pay 34 but they are pros
I feel you there! I have two broken ones in my driveway! What kind of car did you get?
A new car is a new car  Just make sure to get it tune ups and oil changes etc on time
I am so sorry about that. How are you holding up?
I bet thats rough. I would be the same way if my dog died.
Whoops guess you were embarassed.
Have you been back since ?
maybe she is getting older mines a little grumpy as well but i accept it
thats not too bad maybe she needs more attention from you 
Try your local pawn shop for a cheap one you dont want a messy looking yard.
That is crazy maybe you should check offer up and that is crazy I dislike when people steal what is yours especially something you really need. 
Thats great to hear! I am happy for you
That was very nice of them you must have worked hard to get that.
Well sometimes just following orders really well is enough to impress your superiors.
So annoying. Where were their parents?
What a pain in the you know what. I wish the parents could be punished too. Haha
Keep your head up and keep applying to other companies something will come around for you.
It is but you have got to keep grinding.
where are you vacationing
OMG my dream vacation
What were your favorite movies he did?
That is a favorite of mine too! He was so good in it.
Oh..take it back to them..I have had so many take mine and its not cool
Thats sickening. Dont steal stuff or you deserve anytime you get stolen from
Are you kicking them out for a valid reason?
Just make it short and sweet.
I would be the same way. Did the snake attack you?
Well thats ok. Did you kill it?
not my favorite time of the year
when i was a kid the adults use to scare me so since then i have not been a fan but i will take my kids tricker treating
That is horrible
It was just a tire he couldve let it go.
I dont kow anything about that. what happened?
Thats terrible. I had no idea
I see. I used to play this game along with Battlefield in the past when in college. Now I only FIFA only others do not interest me much
Good old days of playing these games all nights with my roommates. Now adult life is so different and boring
Wow how that happened?
That is terrible. What did you do then?
Have you seen doctor
Make sure you get them done
The lovely leaves fall from the trees.
Yeah it really is
where are you heading
just keep your money close to you and your passport closer
Its getting real old to see the teams who have the most money keep winning.
Something has to change. Its very annoying.
Theyve just let me down one two many times.
Its really a long story but I wont be going back.
Okay but Im pretty sure we arent done yet.
Oh really? Its pretty hot where I live. 
Oh wow! That is surprising
where are you heading to
i wish i was you
Same here. Sundays are so much better with NFL.
And this heat can go away too.
Well at least you passed. Youre both on equal ground now.
Thats great itll pay off for her over time.
It is frustrating to work with such people. They should be fired instead of keeping them there
See. They will only hinder the overall performance. You should talk to your manager
I am sorry to hear that. Their is always next time.
I know. I always get that feeling when I dont win the lottery.
Really already!? wow.. what year for you? 
Everything new is always scary. I am sure you are going to do great! Good luck! 
Oh no did you file a police report?
That is good glad it will get taken care of
You have an amazing friend!
Well thats awesome! I bet you will have a great time
Im not too sure about it really but the candys good! What is it you like about it?
Awww thats precious! Perhaps if I had kids it would be different. They must get so excited about dressing up and going out!
Thats excellent news how rewarding! 
Im happy for you! 
Was that an issue for some reason?
Oh okay. Well then it was a nice surprise.
That can definitely get aggravating! It always seems to happen at the worst time.
I understand maybe you can set up certain times or something
i bet you are excited
havent seen her for a while ?
Amazing! How old is he? 
Adorable so happy for you! 
We get really busy in the Fall with a lot of extracurricular stuff.
I see well hang in there. In about 5 minutes theyll be older.
I love the cool breezes of fall
We spend more time outside in fall than summer. summer is way too hot
I dont even know what that is lol
Sounds neat. Do you usually cook korean dishes?
Oh man. Are they still ok?
That sucks. Must hurt throwing all that away.
now is the time the real growing up starts
Oh I would have screamed and ran. I hate snakes so much!
I dont care what kind it is. I will stay far away from them.
So am I! Do you have plans?
That sounds good. I hope you get reenergized.
Maybe she will be .
Okay then run for the hills. 
Wow! Thats quite the milestone! Any plans to retire?
May as well keep going if youre healthy.
Sounds like youre burned out. Where ya going?
The beach is awesome when the weather is good. Hope you have fun!
I know how that feels. Did everything turn up ok?
Could be worse right? Glad everything ended up being ok.
what was she hiding ?
that was probably us when we were little lol  my little nieces are the same way and they are such bad actors too
will you have enough time?
i hope so. It feels good when your day goes smoothly
Thats terrible can you reprint them
Same here. I can sometimes remember where I was the first time Ive seen some to.
Some have aged really well though.
seems to be the norm these days allover the country
i get here nearly everday orl
I miss that too! I am always telling everyone to get off their phones and be present. 
It is and it wont change not even in my house 
it could come in useful but how often though? is it worth it ?
you never know until you try or you can also do those online courses
I hear ya. I hate it when people check their phones when Im trying to talk to them.
I know what you mean.
I bet that was a great time.
That is so cool to have those memories.
thats exciting! I hope everything will go good. just be you and im sure they will love you
i love your confidence!
Yea he did some foul things to those people.
I am glad someone stepped up and spoke out about.
is he a nice person the manager ?
Well thats good. Did she borrow money from you?
Perhaps shes turned over a new leaf. Its very good of you to lend her money even if she is your sister.
Its surprising how people suddenly wake up and realize that perhaps they havent been acting as perhaps they should have.
Good! Plan and spend the money as you wish!
Nice! wish you get more bonus in upcoming months.
Well I hope she gets in soon and you guys have a good time together!
Well that sounds fun! Hope she has a good flight!
I hate other drivers.  It seems like they are getting worse every day.  Did you honk at them or anything?
I would be too.  Im happy you didnt get into an accident or even worse killed!
Oh man. Must be feeling pretty guilty by now.
Just try and be better prepared next time so you dont get tempted again.
Thats really good. Where are you flying to?
Nice! Texas is really nice this time of year.
Thats great news.  Did you have to study or is this an area you are already familiar with?
Awesome good luck on your test! I hope it all goes well!
I love cooking. What did you prepare?
That is trivia. When i am hyped i cook lasagna. I know that is hard to cook but i mastered it all on my own
that is good did you like your watch?
Does it have some cool features?
What is the painting of? It sounds lovely!
Which city was it?
Im sorry someone passed away.  Did you find a good photo to represent that person?
Thats very sweet of her.  Im sure it was nice although sad looking back at those memories.
Congratulations! Does it come with a raise?
Woah thats incredible! You deserved it 
Thats a long time to be away. Are you going by yourself?
The opportunity probably wont come along to many times in a lifetime. You should take advantage of it and enjoy yourself as much as you can.
you dont have friends at work?
no partner at home either? work stuff can be really dtressful
Good for you. Are you really close to this friend? I wish I had more close friends
I am also single and there is no one to take me out just to soothe my inner emotional turmoil
That sucks. did he admit to doing it?
Yeah thats true. I dont let people borrow my car anymore. Too big of an investment
Congratulations on that. Hope you have landed the job? Did you?
What company have you applied to? Is it a big player in the industry it operates?
Will there be a next time ?
Im sorry to hear it went this way for you.
Thats a good idea. Theres a lot of preparation that goes into a good trip.
So true. I hate it when that happens.
No but we are going on a cruise to Cozumel next Spring Break and I think that would be so much fun. Have you ever been?
That sounds amazing! I bet it was so much fun!
What is your budget?
You could buy a trailer?
Congrats! You must have taught her well 
Yum sounds amazing!
Oh boy how did it go?
Congrats thats a real accomplishment!
Thats awesome glad to hear what are you most happy with?
A solid and happy family life is the key to a happy life!
Yes I hear you on that one.
Going swimming on Sunday Relaxing and maybe grocery shopping on Saturday.
OMG I know! Its impossible to sleep  Im sorry that happened to you.
Those scoundrels! How can they get away with that?
Thats a nice surprise! When was the last time you saw him?
Aw thats awesome I hope you two have a good time together!
Thats great! Keep it up. Weight loss is tough
Haha yup dieting is hard. All I want to do is eat delicious stuff all the time
Woah thats nuts! Have you called to complain?
Thats ridiculous! Can you switch?
Thats awesome Im with you I always wished I continued to learn to play the guitar.  Its always a nice skill to have.
Hey its never too late to start up again.  You can always do it as a hobby!
Haha right on. Its nice when they become a little more selfaware and develop parts of the brain that help them realize its not all about them and that its good to be selfless.
Thats the sign of a good parent. Youre reaping what you sowed in a good way. Hopefully it carries on when hes an adult and he becomes another good human being that we have few of
Oh no! Can you do some gig economy work online to try to make enough?
Woah thats awful those things are such a rip off!
Did they help you?
Im glad things worked out for you.
Oh yeah? Why is that?
Thats awesome! What instruments do they play?
Oh that sounds tasty have you eaten it yet?
I know the feeling its too good to stop.
Thats nice. I was never too good at spelling
thats even better. He will be correcting you soon lol
I lost a cat before. Its a lot to deal with.
It get better with time. 
oh wow thats quite a while
oh dang ive never really been in that situation before
wow that is embarassing for them! maybe they had a crazy night and had no time to shower?
oh gosh that is awful! sounds like depression!
That sounds great!  You must have felt really happy!
It sounds like you were quite content and joyful with you time you had with your daughter.
you dont like this dog?
Oh yes i completely understand that. Just get some snacks and watch a lot of movies 
Ouch! Are you okay?
Im so sorry!
Awww whats wrong? Maybe going to the lake will cheer you up?
That is a bummer! Well you can go next time!
You sound like me a few weeks ago with my relatives since they have a bunch of kids under the age of 10. Sorry to hear youre going through the same stress. 
Yeah even if theyre not being annoying or bad... just so many people at once and all that activity.. too much. Love to see them come and love it even more to watch them go.
I had some one tip me a 25 chip at the casino after seeing a pic of my daughter in my locket. I cried lol
Serving tables is hard. some days you can work your hardest and make absolutely nothing. I had to quit after so many years
Do tell! What upgrades have you given it?
Oh thats nice.  What color did you change it to?
Thats a great color
I havent done that in ages. How did you do?
Just gonna have to work harder for next time. 
That sucks if it had been in the coffee shop maybe it could have been replaced.
They have these new portable cup holders that attach to almost anything. Maybe that can help in the future.
I cant wait til I make it that far
I am only a sophmore
Are you happy or sad about moving?
Well I hope you have a good experience in your new city and raise an amazing family!
Oh man!  That is horrible!  What can you do about it?
If you cant it may throw you off by a whole semester!  I would be really mad if I were you!
Nice!  Always good to be prepared makes things a lot less stressful if there is one.
Florida gets hit a lot! Smart move being ready but I hope you stay safe regardless!
What are you doing to improve your self?
So youre improving your self by getting married?
oh my god so sad. how did that happen. Feel so sorry for you
sorry for your loss
Good job its always good to hit the gym and to stay in shape.  I just started again as well.
Just keep at it and Ill do the same! We will be shredded in no time!
Thats a good effective walk!
Yeah i get that. I dont go outside for long periods of time.
Thats too bad. dont give up though
There will be something you like
You must be so proud of her.
That is great to hear. Sounds like she has good head on her shoulder.
Congrats! What will your new position be?
Im jealous of you. Ive had a roommate the past few years since Im in college. First one I had battle depression and mental illness and even checked himself into a behavioral center because he was feeling suicidal. This recent roommate seems normal enough though.
Im glad to hear it. At least you know youre good at being social in some ways. Maybe you can make friends outside of roommates and then be able to be social outside of your apartment and be able to come home and have the peace and quiet.
Hopefully it is just a sprain. Might not need to receive medical attention.
Ouch man. Just keep it on ice for the evening and reassess in the morning.
Im sorry to hear that. Have you called IT?
Maybe its time for a new printer?
That sounds fun. What are you most excited about?
Ive never been dove hunting. It sounds interesting.
Uh oh whose vase did you break?
Ah man thats a bummer hopefully she isnt too mad and will forgive you!
What job did he get?
Thats amazing did he get a job at google?
Fun friends and good food. Who is your team?
Ah thats awesome its always a joy to see a new born baby experiencing its first view of the world!
How old are your kiddos now?
That must be nice. You can focus more on enjoying yourself while away.
That is awesome. They must really like you.
Congratulations! That is great definitely will help your gpa.  Plan on doing the same this semester?
Thats the way to do it you will be thankful you did in the long run!
Aw are they not anymore?
LOL! I hear that 
Thats incredibly sweet. Thats like the best birthday gift too since it probably tasted really good but then showed your time and effort all in one. I heard once to make them taste like a professional made it you just add like extra eggs and sugar and butter or something
Damn.. hope when I have kids that theyre like you. That all sounds great. Youll probably make all of his friends jealous
Oh my gosh thats disgusting!!! I hate when there are flying things buzzing around Soo annoying
Seriously. I wonder where those babies would have been laid? You probably saved someones lunch from being a birthing suite.
Did you get a nice prize for it?
Thats amazing how many people entered?
Huge win do you plan on entering again next year?
Maybe if theres a hot dog one I can enter it too.
Congradulations you must be very proud of her! What is her degree in?
I think thats great to hear. Does she already have an art gallery started?
I would love to but we cant share images on here 
I enjoy watching art. Maybe Ill hapen across some of it!
What kind of lunches do you like to pack for them?
Fingerfoods are always good kid lunches. And I hate having to go to the dang grocery store!
Lol! That is hilarious. I hope you got it on video
omg. I love your mom lol
Thats never a fun thing to do
Do you know what kind it was?
What job did you interview for?
Thats amazing you must be so excited right now
Whoa. What happened?
Oh that is devastating. I hope insurance covers.
I believe there are things in life that are irreplaceable and priceless! There is no amount of money that can give you the true value of your grandfathers watch. I think you should pass it down to your grandchildren.
I consider this a family heirloom and your children would be happy to share this story for years to come.
Wow!  That is amazing!  I guess a little tough instruction and training has paid off!  No need to worry then.
Thats fantastic.  It sounds like she has tapped into her inner musical talent!
What is going to happen?
Oh boy have a great time!
Ew what did you do?
Aw thats disappointing!
Wow Thats unfortunate. Sorry to hear. were you close?
I hope you are finding ways to cope with your loss. That cant be easy to deal with. 
I hope that helps you and that you find peace. 
Im guessing she didnt ask to use them?  Has she taken them in the past?
That would be very frustrating. Hopefully she will learn to replace things as she gets older!
You worked hard what are you studying in school?
I believe you can do it what do you hope to get a job doing after?
Amazing. I bet that was awesome. Do you play yourself?
I bet you were having a great time.
Yea that is really far. Give it some time and I am sure you will meet some new people.
It takes time to adapt to a new city. Get involved in some groups to meet like minded people.
Oh good luck on it! What are you applying for?
Thats a great attitude to have going in. They really pick up on confidence at interviews.
Aw that is really cute of your cat to do.
Its good to have a pet in your life makes you happy.
Why not? I LOVE chicken!
Oh no! Maybe the restaurant you ate from wasnt clean?
Its sad. How many rescues do you have?
Well I appreciate you. 
i want to rescue but I have to wait until I move. No pets allowed here
Oh no!  How old was he?
What type of dog was he?
Thats gross. Did you make the sandwich yourself or buy it from a restaurant?
Nasty. That makes me want to not eat there anymore but I guess it happens sometimes.
I hope you got a refund.
That is just the worst who made fun of you?
Thats so disappointing. People should really not be judging others when they dont know how much effort was put in to the outfit.
Hi are you still here?
It did what were we talking about again?
I can understand that. I lost my dog a few years ago. Whats worse is I wasnt around when it happenedI was out of the state. I hope you at least got to say goodbye.
Man.. Im so sorry. I remember when I was really young I was in the car with my mom and she hit our neighbors cat driving home. They just ran right out into the street. She drove home and cried for a while.
Who knows. They could have been like my mom and maybe they were different and were too ashamed to say anything. Might not have noticed either. Or they were just bad people. Hopefully you can focus on your pet and how much you loved them instead of those things you cant get answers to.
... then what?
Well thats good!  What did you all do?
We do something similar at our Thanksgivings.  Did you make a homecooked meal?
What sorts of pie did yo umake?
We havent really done pies in a while but my grandma makes a chocolate roll and my mom makes some awesome pumpkin bars.  Do you roast your turkey?  We use a turkey fryer for ours.
That sounds pretty awesome.  What did you guys grill?  Was she over for a special occasion at all?
I agree.  I had a cousin living with me for a while until he got on his feet.  I really preferred that over a stranger.  It sounds like you both had an awesome night!
i bet. I miss my friends
Thats good to hear. How old is she?
Hey you can go out and not pay a babysitter. 
Thats good. Were you nervous at first?
Well thats nice that you all get along. you ar actually pretty lucky
Hmm.. whats that mean? Do you feel like you did something wrong?
Ah I see. Yeah thats an easy habit to have. I would be that way too if I wasnt too cheap to spend money. I just try to do a lot of crocpot stuff since I stink at cooking and am poor
OH no! Did you study?
LOL! English is a tough subject.
That is a very big problem to me! However if you signed a new lease with him it seems as if you can deal with it right?
Well it seems that you have to deal with him for at least another year. With that in mind I hope you have more than one bathroom. I suggest you let him keep his poop in one without cleaning it up until it starts to bother him!
Dang that sounds too good to be true. If youre 100 sure that its not a scam and then 100 sure again that its definitely not a scam please really really check in every way possible then Im happy for you!
Whaaat! That was cool of them. If it were me itd be torture trying to figure out what to do. Put it into stocks? Savings? Pay off debt? Go on a vacation? I hate making decisions cause I feel like I messed up no matter what I choose. But maybe you deserve a vacation eh
Congrats. you are lucky
Thats fun do you think you will enjoy it?
Uh oh well at least you wont be a lone when you watch a scary movie.
Ohhh wow.  I hope you were successful!
What did you get in the mail?
That is awful did you miss some payments?
Whats the reason?
Im sorry to hear that how is he feeling now?
Nice!!! When are you planning on going?
Thats so close. Have you gone jet skiing on that lake before?
I know that feeling! I have 2 dogs and 1 cat. Love them to death.
Yeah! and they are so excited to see you and welcome you home!
Why has it taken so long?
Sorry.. when I first read what you said I read it as Grandparents.. I dont know why.  My brain is tired from work.
Oh no how did you end up in that situation.
Haha thats awesome at least you two made it out of it safely.
I would have been so excited lol.  What did it look like?!
Was anyone with you?  Did anyone believe you?
Thats awesome though.  I didnt graduate until I was 40 something
That really is quite an accomplishment.. the type that makes you cry at graduation ceremonies!
Thats very sweet. I was just dogsitting my neighbors dogs last week. They were a little annoying at first but I had to watch and stay with them the whole week and I really grew to like them. They felt like my little sisters I had to take care of and play with
Right yeah you just get used to their presence. I hated that theyd bark so much at thunderstorms but other than that their little quirks were growing on me. In fact I miss them right now
Have you been drinking more water lately? or its just happening for no reason?
That would be a good idea its better to get tested and treated early if it is anything serious!
Oh my!  You must have been pretty embarrassed.  Did someone bring you gas?
Im sure its happened to him before and understands.
Awesome! How was that? do you think she will enjoy high school?
I know that feeling Im waiting for the college to start myself!
Aww thats so sad. Im sure she would have wanted yall to keep having fun times together.
Yes its good to keep bonding. I understand not being able to do it at first though
Oh man mine too! Its so annoying.
Sure does. I think they get a little jealous and just want our attention. Theyre also very curious about the world which is a good thing!
Is there not an upgraded version?
Oh. I know what you mean. I am like that with shoes. I always change my phone
I would have though that your crystal ball would have forewarned you? 
Did you keep your receipt?  Maybe you can exchange it or get your money back?    lol
I feel your pain totally.  I take an online class and I am a teacher at a new school this year
Fun times!  Makes you think back to being in HS.  I am working in a HS this time.
Nice! I hate looking for apartments. Im in college and have looked for apartments for the past three years. It gets really old after a while since Im on a budget and its hard to find something cheap but not a rats nest. Glad you found what you wanted.
I live right next to my campus too! The downside is its a building made in the 50s and looks terrible on the inside. But I can bear it since Im saving money. Most college kids have their parents money and just choose a fancier place because they dont care about money. 
I hate that!  Knowing a spider or any sort of bug is in your room and then knowing you have to go to sleep.  I would have done the same thing.
Haha while he builds back up his spider web.
LMAO.  LOLOL.  I pay 600 a month.  You?
see it can get worse!  lol... I am paying cash for my classes now but I only take 1 at a time.
Thats sad well HAPPY BIRTHDAY! 
I sort of feel the same way the older I get the less I care about my birthday.
Ah so are you feeling pretty lonely? Thats interesting that he took the dog with him on a business trip but who am I to judge! Could be viewed as kind of cool that hes that close with the dog.
Yeah he should have left the dog with you so not only would you have some company but some protection too. But I dont know all of the situation so I guess I shouldnt say for sure! Hopefully its not for too long so you guys can get back to being a trio
Aw you shouldnt feel bad!  At some point youll have more cash and do the treating.  Theres a lot of give and take in relationships.
I totally get it.  I bet you think about it way more than she does though I dont know if that makes you feel any better lol
What restaurant is it?
What kind of food do they make? Sorry to hear that! Thats awful.
Maybe they could get funding from the municipality.
Marked what wrong?
Did you speak with him?
Oh. Well he will probably fix it when he gets better
Wow congratulations! That is a really cool endeavor!
Sometimes it is worth taking a risk like that to have a high reward.
Im sorry to hear that. Hopefully after this project you can get some time off to spend with your family.
Im sure your family will understand. And look at the bright side youll cherish your next visit even more.
That is always a good thing.  Is it free or a toll road?  Where I live most of em cost money.
Thats awesome.  Saves time and money.
Nice! School is starting next week for me also hopefully we both have a good school year!
Is this your first year working this job? If so hope it goes well!
She is most certainly going to enjoy that!
No special occasion then?
Yay! is it her first year or just excited to get some free time?
Oh wow shes must be smart! But yeah that must be stressful.
Interesting. What is your presentation about?
Thats so cool! Is it like a best friend for someone who may be lonely?
Oh that sucks I would honk harder at him
Yeah some cities have a lot of people and some really bad drivers. Theyre rude and disrepectful to all other people even pedestrians.
I hope you goodluck in the future
One day when you are successful I hope you pass your good luck forward!
Oh thats terrible! If you dont mind me asking Who and why?
Maybe he is trying to do what he thinks is best. Im sure its out of love not just being mean.
So he was ok with it? or?
OMG I am so jealous I love fishing.  Where are you going?
Fun times!  I did a little beach fishing not long ago at New Smyrna.  I hope you catch some cool fish!
Have fun for me!
Oh bless her heart. I hope you are nice to her.
Thats really nice of you for being nice to her. I bet she is happy that you are her coworker.
Oh well thats terrible! Hopefully your husband was okay and nobody else was hurt. But its awful that anyone was.
Yes there are many times the emotional pain from tragic events are worse than physical. It doesnt make it easier that it was a person you knew Im sure. 
Congrats!  What class?
You deserve to be happy about that that is not an easy class!
Thats going to be a pain to fix yourself!
That was really shady of them to do that wonder why they did?
thats awesome  i have not purchased cds in ages lol
i bet that brought back a lot of wonderful memories  from the good old days
When doe sit come out in theatres?
Oh I got you what system is it going out on?
Oh no I hope you was paying attention to what was around you.
That is really scary when you are alone.
Oh my gosh what a place to break down!  I was born in ND and I know the dark you are talking about.  Were you stuck for long?
Oh yeah of course.  I heard they are rampant up in those parts.  Did they keep you long?
I hope they returned you with all your bits and parts.  It would be alarming to find they borrowers from you later!
Oh man truer words were never spoken! How are you gonna spend your free time this weekend?
Thats my thought process like every week. I think I might be getting old because sometimes I like sleeping more than being awake.
Oh no! All that work for nothing
Did it at least taste good? lol
That is good that he had an air compressor. Low tires seem to be the story of my life. I seem to always have to be airing up a tire.
They are very handy to have. We got a box that airs up tires and has jumper cables also.
They work really great. Well worth the extra dollars.
Awesome.  Is she going to university after?
Thats great to hear.  Shell be flying out of the nest before you know it.
Thats awesome! Not too many are able to do that!
Awesome. Im glad that she has things going for her and congratulations to you!
What type of food do you miss most?
It sounds like you might be from down south. I would miss it there too.
What?! Are you sick or your family member?
Oh no Im so sorry to hear that it must have been hard on you
How exciting!  Who did you order from that gave you such good service?
I would order again also thats a good company.
Thats great! I went a few months ago and really enjoyed it
I hope you have lots of fun!
wow thats great your are so lucky to see it
How exciting!  Is that your going to be your first time visiting?
I hope you have a good time there.  Be careful in the interior its hot as heck there.
Aw was she stressed out?
Aw thats no fun. I bet the constant construction didnt help at all
Oh wow!  My dog passed away recently too so I can relate to your pain.  I am so sorry for your loss
Most definetly she was my constant companion.  It will hopefully get easier for us each day
Why do you feel that way?  Has he enacted any policies that directly affect you or anyone you know?  For the record  Im not too fond of him either just curious more than anything.
I agree that he has said some things to suggest that.  However I do think he has done some good and wouldnt necessarily be the worst president we have ever had.
That is very thoughtful.  Happy Birthday! What did you get from your partner?
Wow!  Now thats one cool gift if I may say so myself.
Wow was it?
Thats awesome. Have you been going to school for a while or is this for first semester.
Awesome. Its great. Helps keep down the student loans.
Yes Mechanical engineering.
Math and science is my strong suite.
What did you have in there?
I love veggies do you know who did it?
Thats mean of them they better give it back to you.
Id still scorn them for their actions.
Whats your favorite holiday?
I love that pie!!! Its delicious! My favorite holiday is Christmas. 
Thats good! I think a lot of older people are pessimistic about the future but I grew up on technology and am excited to see what new stuff comes out.
I think we need more people like you in society.
Thats smart. You dont want to forget anything. Are you planning a trip soon?
What a relief right? Where are you going?
I did too. Graduated High School in 85
Well thats different then.
Pit stops can be fun.  How did you do on the scratch off?
No way! Congrats!!! Ive never come close to that much on a scratch off.  I bet your heart was racing.
Hahaha that sounds like fun
Thats great! I like to go dancing too
What type of work do you do?
You must be getting a big pay raise you ole banker.
I hate when that happens.  Did they end up apologizing at all or did they play it off like nothing happened?
I would be too.  Its not fun when a couple people ruin a night that should be a great time!
Thats no good how did you break it?
no good are you going to get another one?
Id buy it off you after its fixed I love tag heuer.
I wouldnt maybe I could get some recommendations for a nice one?
Which chemistry class are you taking?
Yikes. organic chemistry was the last chemistry class I took.     Yuck reaction mechanisms... sn1 sn2 etc.
yeah I wasnt a huge fan of the class.
Depends on what way youre talking about Maybe physics 1 or maybe calc II.  Thats where things really started to come together for how things work   the math to understand how things work.
What are your favorite parts about your childhood?
That sounds like a lot of fun.  Did you do this with friends and family or alone?
I hope it goes well!  Are you worried?
Then everything should go fine!  Good luck I hope you get a raise!
Do you have a lot of experience baking cakes?
Sounds like fun. Are you excited?
Oh wow I have never been either.  Try not to be nervous!  Who are you going with?
Well I am sure you will have fun.  Just follow the instructors lead!
Thats too bad did they fit your style?
Well you saved some money at least?
How come you had to cheat on the quiz?
What did you end up making on the t est?
Where are you guys going?
Thats awesome what a sweet boyfriend how old are you turning?
Happy birthday! You must be excited
My favorite team used to the Bruins but then I moved
Did you sit close to the ice?
Amazing I love Chara
Well that was absolutely terrible! He certainly picked the worse time to do it. Youre right he was a jerk!
Oh well Im sorry that is definitely an unpleasant Valentines day. But on the positive side at least you found out what a jerk he was before you became more committed. 
Thats awesome!  I bet you were really excited!  
You should go out and celebrate
Maybe its time to instill a little discipline.
How old are your  children?
Do you think youll be next ?
Theyd shut down then.
Have you been through many hurricanes?  We stock up in case a tornado takes out the power.
Ive been through quite a few tornadoes.  I live in Missouri but before that I lived in Kansas.  Have you ever had to use your supplies?
Yikes!  So far we havent had to dig into the water or food.  I do debate on getting a generator though.
Aw thats so sweet. Did you find one to make?
Sound interesting! Its a cookie or is it cakelike?
Oh that must be hard.  Are you guys really close
Man I know how that feels.  When I go to visit my sister and nieces I have such a hard time when its time to fly home
You have done such a great job! You should be proud of yourself and not be afraid to do so. 
Dont be ashamed or set yourself short espcially since you worked so hard. If you feel scared or hesitant to do so than I would talk to her boss to possibly set up a meeting.
What sport are you talking about?
I really do not like hockey it is boring as hell
How come youre so angry?
That is no good at all how come you did that?
Well Im sure you are super nervous! Of course I have no doubt all will be well and a new experience for you!
Yes and worse case perhaps you can carry something on board to help relax your nerves just in case. Theres always alcohol too!
Are you excited?
Do you know if youre having a boy or girl yet?
I hope its a boy I love kids.
Got to get him playing some sports for sure.
That sucks. Did she say why?
Wow thats harsh.
Find a new girlfriend.  That ship has sailed.   If youre really still want her consider trying to play the jealousy card.  ie make her jealous
You dont even have to do that. Keep it classy. Just show up with a pretty girl and have a good time and be a perfect gentleman.  Dont even bat an eye at her.
Thats great! How old are your kids?
Thats really when they start to come into their own. Must be really neat!
Can you send it back for an exchange ?
We all make mistakes just send it back and have it the way you want it.
Thats good you have someone that you can talk to about your problems and feelings. Im sure it helps!
It can be hard to find the right therapist so its great you have found one that really is there for you and helps.
I am sorry you have had a difficult time.  What is EP?
I am so happy you have someone so special in your life!
Thats great! Is your position changing?
Oh more money is always good
Im sure theyll be delicious.
Im glad they came in for you.
Well work can be stressful for many and do that. Often we can bring it home with us.
That would be very disappointing and frustrating Im sure. No doubt you wonder why they would do such a thing!
Im sorry to hear that.  How are you going?
Thats true.  Just remember that as much as it might sting now there are plenty of people out there and you want to find one that makes you happy all of the time not just some of the time.
Man that is really hard.  I can relate however bc my sweet Rileydog just had to be put to sleep due to congestive heart failure
It doesnt.  Try hard to stay positive and remember he isnt suffering anymore
Yummy! Thats great. Its always nice when you bake something and it turns out just right.
Well thats okay. Im sure it tasted fantastic.
You could always watch it online!
Dont worry I will tell Hollywood to make new episodes for you!
A little jealous much?  Maybe you should pick up a side job?
Maybe you can borrow them?
Good for you. You deserve to take some time for yourself. Anything special on that you want to watch?
Sounds like its going to be a good night. Enjoy.
Oh wow You think you baby might be a little sick?
Im glad to hear it. Its always nice to get a little me time to get things done.
They are very busy but if she made an appointment with you then she should be there on Monday.
Oh no you are leaving the neighbors to terrorize some unsuspecting people. That is funny.
Omg..You should get out fast as you can then. Everyone cant be trusted.
Oh no I hate situations like that when you still have to see people like every day ugh.
Dont show your anger at all  or let her know it got to you.
That will bother her more I believe lol.
How old is he? Is he mature?
I am happy for you! I hope you keep being friends forever!
I bet she was really happy about that. 
Yikes that would drive me crazy.
It would drive me crazy also she should be more considerate. 
Maybe she will start paying on time.
Thats awesome! Did it cost you alot?
Well Im glad that it worked out for you!
I would feel the same! heights are scary
lol! Well its ok its not like you need to do anything with heights unless you have to fly a lot. I do..but I dont like it
I feel you on that. That is awful. Is there anyone above him?
You want to make trouble?
Oh ok! I see. Well youre not making trouble anyhow he is
Why this happened? Is he bad at what he is doing?
That is terrible if he blamed you.
It will feel good when it done though!
And your hard work will pay off!
Sorry to hear that
Cool. What did it look like?
Are you going to display it?
Well thats nice. Maybe you can pass it don to your kids too
That sounds really nice.  Did you have fun?
Ugh thats terrible.  I hope you found the money!
Sounds like you will! You sound confident in yourself and Im sure your manager is or he wouldnt have trusted you to do it.
Definitely. Hopefully lead to a promotion for you soon!
Why do you think you will fail?
When is the test? Practice makes perfect! Fit it in!
How much did you pay for the new one?
That is a great bargain Will you use it tonight?
What things are you looking forward to?
It sounds like your positivity will bring about something good
How does she help you out?
She sounds like a great girlfriend
i havent played video games in so long.
i agee. i used to loooove playing mortal kombat.
I get that I guess you can just bring cleaning supplies!
Why didnt you finish?
Oh. Its not too late is it?
What has she been lying about?
Are you going to punish her?
What does he ask about?
Wow. That has got to be annoying. I can never finf my landlord
Why didnt you wore them?
That is sad. I hope you find them.
Howd they ruin it?
Sounds like a mess were they punished in some way? 
Oh I hope you seek help for that
I am not a football fan. What did they do last season?
That is super cool. I hope they win this one too.
Howd she pass away?
I used to play that game with my little cousins
Cool. I never have time for video games any more
Wow that is impressive how old is she?
That is impressive congrats on raising a smart kid!
Call of duty?
I used to play
I might check it out. Get back in the game.
you didnt make them clean it up?
Very cool! Have you ever done yoga before or would this be a first time?
Cool!  Ive heard it can be tough but I think it would be fun to try out!
OMG! I dont blame you. I would be extremely upset also.
Mine does also! It seems like it just keeps getting worse and worse. 
YES! I hate it. I cant wait till this dark time in our history is over. Hopefully a few people end up in jail! 
I dont take death well either!
Some act like it never happened. A lot of apathy going around. Youll see her again someday!
That is certainly a blessing good for you!
I get that but I hope that continues for you!
Are you happy now?
Well thats good. IT will come it you work for it.
How many do you have now?
Oh well there you go good choice!
I probably would have tried to shoot him thinking he was an intruder
I understand. I had that problem when I was kid. Now it is ok.
Anyway you can watch other movies.
You feel liked now?
Why did you not get driven there?
Wow that is not safe at all for a kid though
That is great! I bet you are feeling very good.
It takes a while to feel that great. I am almost there.
sorry to hear that
Gotta play to win that is what my grandma always said
Best of luck with it if you hit it big slide a few million my way haha
Thats nice. You guys hang out a lot?
Keep it up. You guys can be in each others weddings lol
Oh that looked decent hope you like it!
What did you do to him after?
Whatd he say to that?
Same here. I cant do it
I dont even try I can barely watch suspense movies
Their toddlers were in the street? I feel like that is almost CPS level issues
What did you do? Sometimes I just sleep and that is enough for me
how did it work out for you?
good luck i hope all goes well
I am sorry. Maybe not focus as fridaysunday as the weekend but as any other day. And do things you would normally do on other days.
That is a tough one. What do you normally do other then work on those days?
Is there anything else you do besides work? A hobby you enjoy video games music working out?
Healing is never easy. It always has the negatives. Any sort of healing always starts with pain a open wound and itchy scabs and the left over scar. I wish I could talk to you daily and help you get through it. I know its hard to go and do things alone. I recently discovered a text number that allows you to talk to someone when you are feeling down. it is 741741. I have used it just recently myself. It does work and is better then nothing. 
Thank you for your words! I have a mom to talk too so it helps but loads of trauma abuse and death are hard to even talk about. Thank you! I hope you feel better too! I have had to talk to customers who were nasty to clerks before! Its shocking.
I know right? Oh lord the food industry is the worst especially for waitresses.
Ohhhh yum!  What are your favorite toppings?
Thats what I get too!  I also get vegan cheese...its delish!  Hope you have a great time chowing down tonight!
Oh no Im sorry to hear that. Did you reschedule?
I hope you guys will still get to spend quality time together and of course get some rest in.
how did you manage
Oh why did you go that way?
Wow that sounds scary and horrible. What was it?
Oh I see. Im glad the police came and took care of it. Sounds like a scary experience.
If you go into it with a good attitude Im sure at the very least it wont be bad. What kind of classes will you be taking?
Ooof! Best of luck to you Im sure youll be fine. Math was never my strong suit.
Why do you like the eagles?
I understand. I hope that they will win again
What did you argue about?
That is smart sorry that is happening to you!
What movies do you like to watch instead? 
Any favorite actors? 
Hahahaha that is the way sumer is supposed to be for kids.  Did they at least do the things you asked them to do?
Ohh no its worse than I thought.  Its one thing to relax but thats different.  What are you doing to whip them back into shape?
Thats terrible. Where?
Oh no! thats really terrible.
They arent that bad
Watch in the day time with the lights on and the tv volume low. Thats how I got into them
Are you happy or sad about that?
Oh well congrats then haha
I love seafood buffets
lol. thats an oldie but goodie
That is so cool and thoughtful!
yuk.. did you pull it out and continue to eat?
Why? What happened
Aww that sucks. Did you find him?
How big was it?
Well great job get something nice with it you deserve it!
Oh yeah I cant take scary movies of any kind.  I used to watch some of them when I was in my 20s.  What kind of movies do you like?
Yeah they are way better than scary ones. Seems like there are horror movies coming out every other day now a days.
Not at all. It is kind of boring being left to clean everything alone.
And you might get called a weirdo. Haha
Oh man thats awesome! What concert were the tickets for?
Well I hope you have fun! Im almost completely deaf so I dont know that much about music.
what do you think is wrong?
ah i am sorry for that! hoping for the best!
I hate that
What is the purpose of that!
That is nice. Did you know the restaurant before going there?
That is super cool.
That is great congratulations on the new place.  Is it somewhere you have wanted to move for a while now? 
That is so nice.  When do you move?
Im sorry to hear that. Why was that?
Well that really stinks.
thats awesome that it works for you
Thats really good! Did you lose weight or have you just not felt comfortable with yourself before?
Thats awesome! The best part of that is looking good is only just a side affect of being healthier in general which is great to be.
Oh that stinks. Does she live far away?
I completely understand that. Im so busy I hardly socialize at all.
That is sad. Do you have other children?
I understand. Anyway he will keep visiting.
Oh wow! Did you get your money back?
Oh good luck with that! Next time use airbnb or vrbo
Wow that is impressive I could not do that at that age
Wow she has a bright future ahead of her if that is the case
Why its okay to be differnt
If he is rich then I am jealous of him too
That sounds upseting. Why were you scared?
Oh man well wear silver. That can supposedly burn them and scare them away. 
yea that sounds like a plan
I feel you!  My two kids know all the rules and yet they just go out the window when they want to take something or use something that isnt theirs.  I always joke that you cant have nice things with kids.
Congratulations! Are you having a party?
Thats sounds nice and romantic
That game was fun to watch last year. Do you live in Philadelphia?
I love it there. I dont normally like football but its always good when the Patriots lose.
No one has ever given me a car. That must be nice
That very nice of them
What did they do to it?
Kids are like that sometimes sorry about that
Oh no this is a classic office disaster story. How bad was it?
Ah heck I hate that for you. Hopefully it isnt as bad for you as it seems but just know that that mistake has happened to several people that I know of so youre not alone.
That sounds awesome.  I barely remember 3rd grade.  I think we just played games and had fun.
Wow thats so deep.  I cant imagine having to deal with that at that age.  They mustve been what like 8?  thats a lot to put on a kid
What did he say?
Why would he even do that?
Thats great! I hope their marriage goes well.
Well that may be difficult if you arent married first.
Cool! What kind of business?
Wow thats pretty ballsy nice job!
That is awesome.  Is she a doctor?
How much longer does she have in school?
Really? What you got going on?
That will be so much mush. He is going to have a great time.
Aww that was nice of them!!
lol.  Maybe they all came into work early just to surprise you!
That is great do you get to see them much?
That is really good that you get to see them all the time.  Do you have kids too?
That doesnt sounds like a surprise
Oh you just know that theres something going on. Thats pretty cool
Yeah that is pretty upsetting. I dont get what is so hard about throwing away your trash. 
Maybe the kids will see all of the trash and see that it is bad and grow up to not  litter?
Oh yeah those shows can fascinating!
Its true but I also cant help but watch. Its exciting to learn in any case.
Whos car was it?
What kind of car did she get you?
That is amazing that you got tickets.  What was your favorite part?
That is awesome.  How far in advance did you have to buy the tickets?
Thats exciting!  I hope hes doing well in school!
Nice i love football.
Oh cool!  Is he going to let you drive it?  lol
Maybe you can swap Toyotas for a day D
Yeah me too. Some people have some amazing talents. 
Yeah magic is pretty great!
Those movies are amazing.  I loved the last one with Thanos.  He was a cool character.
I actually started to understand where he was coming from...in a sick kind of way.
Thats sad. What country is that?
Wow that is far. When did you come here?
What is it like over there?
Yeah I can imagine it would be simpler there.
Awww I completely understand. I remember that feeling. And mine is now a senior. Time flies! Cherish every moment with him!
I only have one. And next year hell be going off to college. I wish I didnt have to work so much so I could have spent more time with him when he wanted to
Yea that would have been great if I could have done it. Im happy that you do!
Its still better that an empty house!
That sounds so sad.  I hope he was ok
You have to be careful though.  Sometimes people can be really dangerous when they have nothing to lose
Why did you want to do that?
That makes a lot of sense. Sometime thats just how it goes though. 
Oh wow are you okay?!
I hope so and I hope you do good in the tournament  Just rest that finger and let it heal.
Oh no   I hope theres someone you can stay with
From me?  But why lol?
Oh.  That sucks Im sorry 
That is very nice. What are going to do with money?
He must be a super hero I would have offered to help him haha. 
I wish I could have seen that sight ask him for his workout schedule.
Im so sorry. Thats horrible. I cant imagine how you must feel
I know you cant ever replace him but Would you consider getting a new dog?
Yeah I stole money of my moms dresser once. 
Wow thats really rough. It was only 5 but she was still really upset about it. 
That is weird. Did you say anything?
Well that is pretty gross.
What movie? I cant watch scary movies anymore since having kids they are too realistic now haha
Thank you for the heads up! Maybe sleep with a night light on tonight  Sweet dreams!
Oh no!  Extra workload is terrible!  Did you make it through?
I bet.  Did you relax when you got home?
Thats a killer end to a stressful day!  
Oh! I thought it was something bad I hate roller coasters too!
Thats kind of sad.  What makes you reluctant?
Well Im sure the odds are against him but I hope he succeeds this time.
Man I wish I had the money to afford a boat I dont know about you.
Imagine days spent cruising around on the water!
You got this girl! I was induced when I had my daughter a year ago! I was scared too but honestly dont remember much.
Just enjoy and rest on your last weekend before baby Itll all be worth in when you are holding your little girl  Dont listen to those scary stories those are the 1 in a million chances it goes wrong!
Thats awesome! What kind of restaurant is it?
Oh those are great and a lot of times they make everything fresh! What is your favorite meal there?
Did you find any?
Thats super frustrating! Did you walk out?
Thats the bit I kind of dont like about restaurants. I get why they dont let you get your own beverages but at the same time it seems unnecessary to have to wait for someone to refill your glass.
Wow are you ok?
Hahaha that mustve been pretty funny though. Im assuming heshe helped you up?
Thats good where was it?
What would you do with friends? 
Sounds like you lucked out make sure she knows how special she is 
Yes dont let a night go by without saying I Love You.
That makes a lot of sense. I wouldnt be happy either! I hope that they have good insurance
Wow! Thats aweful. Is your mom ok?
Man that really does stink! Hopefully the police will find some way to catch the guy!
What kind of tricks can you do?
Thats pretty cool! I am fascinated by that!
Does he have a bad back or was it just an enormous thing?  Did you get to go over?
Oh my goodness!  Thats awesome!  Does that feel weird to know hes going to be a Dad?
Those have got to be some good memories for you!
Yeah life really comes at you fast huh?
Whats happening tomorrow?
Oh wow that sounds like fun your a great uncle!
Kids can be so annoying sometimes.  I hate those shoes with wheels that they have.  so annoying
I just saw a girl wearing them at walgreens tonight.  I wanted to trip her lol
What rides did you go on?
I hate rollercoasters too!
Sounds relaxing being a mom I could use a day like that! 
I hope it was a good day for you atleast you did something productive and got some laundry done haha
Thats pretty gross. It happens though. Did they comp you?
Great! They should get a great review as we all have hair everywhere. Its bound to happen at  some point.
How long have you been sick?
Wow thats a lot. Is it clearing up?
Wow!  Impressive!  He must be beaming and you must be so proud!
I bet his face was priceless when he found out!  Those are the best times in life!  Take him out for vegan ice cream!
Im impressed you didnt explode!  My wife wouldve gone insane.  She hates that kind of stuff.  How long did it take to clean up?
What Ive found is everything is salvageable if you really wantneed to.  I recommend looking on YouTube to see how to remove the oil from the fabric.  Keep your head up youll be alright!
I know there will be something on there!  YouTube has taught me more about life than my parents.  In 20 minutes you will know how to clean your couch and take the engine out of your car.
oh those places are fun.  Its like dinner and a show..  Was it expensive?
thats smart.  We went to one for my wifes birthday once and it cost a fortune!
Are you moving?
I went on vacation about 4 months ago it was really fun. I went to Orange Beach AL
They are really bad especially if you have pets.
Yea. You have to be careful with flies because they can lay eggs in your pets food.
I have never tried it
Wow you must be proud! How old is he?
They grow up so fast! Glad he isnt scared anymore.
You got a day off? Man I wish I could get a day off
Was it fun?
how did it turn out
thats cool that you made it through
Oh boy!  Congratulations are in order then?!!  How many kids do you have then? 
I totally get it.  If I found out that I was pregnant right now Id pass out and cry for a few minutes and then be happy.  ha ha.  I pray for your wife and her body! he he.
I would be disappointed in him if I were you.  He sounds like a real low life.  Maybe you should kick that bum to the curb.
I dont if it were up to me we would all be artificially inseminated and men would be kept like livestock.
sheesh thats a great deal! 
how many packs did you stock up with? lol
Why What happened?! I hope your dog is okay.
Oh man Im sorry. My two dogs are my babys I cant imagine how you feel.
Is she?  Thats pretty awesome!!  Howd you land her?
Sweet!!!  Did you have a good time?
Yeah I bet.  
10th grade was a good year.  I met my favorite girlfriend that year.  Is he excited?

Thats awesome. Will you be relaxing at home or elsewhere?
I love camping. Hopefully you wont meet too many mosquitos!
Thats awesome! Are you going to go see it?
Wow thats a long way to go. Its really cool you have one opening up near you. 
Congrats! A day off is always nice.  Did you do anything fun with your extra time?
Haha relaxing days can be super helpful.  I hope you have a good rest of your weekend!
That sounds nice! Do you enjoy your new home?
That makes a big difference. Getting your feng shui on the go!
20 bucks?  Id try to do it too.  Howd it go??
Awesome!  Hell know not to challenge you next time!  20 bucks richer!
is this her first one?
Whered everyone go?
hahaha did you kick family or roomies out?
That sucks. Whats going on next week?
I dont think anyone enjoys going to the dentist.
aww im sorry.  did they leave without you
That was really nice of them.  you have some really good friends
That is so scary what happened?
Wow that is scary! Be careful.
Ohhh Congratulations!  I am sure you will be ok.  Is it your first?
Think of how many people have babies.  If they can do it so can you!
did anyone see ?
oh well you lived through it!
Really? Why was that?
Well there are some good safety apps for your phone that a friend can monitor you as you walk home. Maybe you want to try one of those. 
Thats what moms do! I think its in our blood.
That is truenot all moms are that way and that is sad.
Thats fantastic to hear!
Wow mustve been scary
Thats good at least
Thats crazy! I wonder if hes stocking up or is cooking for a lot of people.
2 bags and Im already struggling.
make a plan to pluck her away
dump the first and go for her
Thats really awesome! Cats are like the best pets ever. 
Oh... I didnt know those were real. 
Did she pass away or did something else happen?
Thats sad one of my friends dog died a few years ago. We were all very sad because he was such a nice pit
I dont really trust dealerships. Whats wrong with your car?
Ah youre getting maintenance done. Thats good.
That is so exciting and different.
I bet so that doesnt happen often.
Im sorry to hear that!
Good luck. Maybe a better opportunity will come around.
i can relate my brothers ex wife  uses all the child support money on her self and her crack head boyfriend  my brother buys my nieces close and toys because she wont
its horrible to hear  but i agree with you 100 percent some people should not have kids at all
That is some dedication.  Did he finally heal up?
Im glad to hear that he is better now  you did a great thing by helping him.
oh no thats terrible. where do you live?
oh yeah that could be dangerous!
Thats really awesome that you have a great partner like her!
Yes I am and my wife is awesome too!
Sharks are definitely scary.
Is where you went known to have sharks?
Wow thats very nice of them! Someone taught them well.
Yes each kid has their own personality sometimes. Ive seen some families that had some kids that were angels and one of them was a nightmare!
I am sorry to hear that. I hope she is comfortable at least.
Do you have plans on how to spend these last days with her?
Oh man! I bet you felt bad. 
I am sure she understands it was an accident.
That is so good to hear! What makes her so great!
You have a great wife for sure then.
do you have to pass the gre? 
your husband could probably help you with the math portion!
gotcha... bock bock chicka chicka 
What have you used them on so far? 
They sound like good knives
Did he like it?
They grow up so fast! You must be proud of them though.
Do they bother your stomach?
Oh goodness so you have an allergic reaction to them then?  Do you have to carry an epi pen just in case some slip by you unaware?
Significant others can be hit or miss sometimes.
Your husband sounds like a keeper. How long have you two been together?
Have you made an appointment with your doctor?
I would just to be safe!
Thats very true but Im sure their both very smart and know how to avoid dangerous situations. 
That will be great! A little peace of mind is all you need. 
thats awesome! what college you go to?
holy smokes thats legit! 
Wow thats a terrible situation. Did you report it to the police?
Well thats no very helpful. What about cancelling your card at the bank and reporting fraudulent charges? 
My best friend just told me that they are planning to get a sex change. I had no idea!
He is planning to be a she as soon as she can get the operation scheduled with the doctor. I think I will take at least a few months.
thats awesome! do you guys raise multiple horses?
i would love to be able to have horses
Yes it is very disgraceful.
I know. It is so hurtful to so many involved.
A sub for what?
Oh that sounds good. The closest sub store we have is SubWay.
He must be so precious!
Cherish him while you can. They really grow up fast.
Wow. Thats crazy. What even happened?
Someone should definitely report him.
how do you feel about it ? honestly if someone is respectful to me i dont care who they like  thats the way my dad raised me 
im straight but the way my dad raised me  he said to respect all sexes  and what ever religion i choose was up to me  i have never gone to church 
Oh no!  What happened??
OMG who was it?  What did they do??
AHH!!  Did you call the police?
Did he hurt you??
A trip sounds great! So where are you going?
Florida is a great state to have vacation fun! Can you bring me a seashell back? 
Lol...Thank you the kids and I love to listen to the sound of the ocean through them.
lol i know the feeling. how great would it be to hit a jackpot though
shoot you aint the only one!
I like the Ravens.  People always get hurt in football..
No I my boyfriend had on the Dolphins.. BLAH lol
You must be so excited and proud!
Has he talked yet?
Awesome! I wish I was a better cook.
I believe that!
Thats so sad. Im sorry to hear that. Is he getting a treament? 
Wow thats awful. I hope you can tell her all about him and share some pictures at least. 
Wow thats not something Id expect to see just looking out my window at the street!  Were you impressed?
Ha!  Well just make sure youve got good insurance on all of them first!!
Congratulations! Was it your last final?
Good luck. Itll be worth it.
Oh no have you tried talking about it?
Give her a few days and try again
That is really great to hear! Couples break up so fast these days.

Yeah thats good.  Youre a good friend.  Good on you lad!
Oh wow! Congrats! Thats awesome!
I would love to go someday.
Ut oh.. are you nervous?
Im sorry.  Dont worry.  It never is as bad as you think it will be.
I cannot imagine how scary that would be!  Were you home or away?
Do you mean your security system or do you mean that which keeps your family secure?
Definitely.  Did you make any adjustments to prevent or protect yourselves after this horrific event?
That sounds like a lot of fun! Did you have a great time?
That was very thoughtful you are very lucky!
Thats awesome. Is it your favorite band?
You must love music. Are tickets expensive?
man thats legit! i am so lazy lol
i run 1 10k a year lol
that is incredible! congrats is she your first?
its so awesome to have a child! my son is a little over a year
She sounds wonderful. How long have you two been together?
Thats really amazing. I wish you two the best.
Haha thats funny. The same things used to happen to me except with the game Resident Evil. I love that game and was scared to play it at the same time.
Yes! I remember that. I was just looking at getting an emulator so I could play it again on my computer.
i love art if thats what you mean  i started taking painting classes recently 
Thats awesome i used to do the tattoos and recently purchased 2 tatoo machines a shader and a liner  been drawing since i was 5 years old
Im sorry to hear that. 
I wish you healing and comfort.
Thats wonderful! Whats been going on?

I bet you are scared! It will be fun though!
Hey thats great of them!!  Did you get anything cool?
Thats fantastic!  What an awesome day huh?
hahaha I guess no one warned you about how scary that movie is hu?
Good idea. Having someone around might help you recover from it.
Oh no! Thats no fun. So youre cancelling it completely or will you wait until you feel better?
Thats too bad Im sorry to hear that. I hope you feel better soon!
how exciting! I love concerts
Honestly I can get into most kinds of music. What artistband is the concert?
thats awesome! glad to hear that!
it does i agree! its always great when someone gets paid for their hard work
Oh wow Im sorry but your health is more important!
Sounds like you have a great friend! 
I used to have to be on call and I hated it especially after I worked all week.
Thats true that is part of it I guess.
Oh thats sweet. What kind of things does he do?
Oh thats very nice! He must work very hard then!
Could be better but its nice to know someone is having a great week!
Oh now Im just getting jealous!
Oh?  How was it?

ooooh nice  i would be so pumped too see them  enjoy
ah no thats horrible i hate to hear that
thats legit! i love mma and jiu jitsu is crucial 
Are you excited about that do you think youll be checking it out when it opens.
We have a local pizza place here and it is SO much better than all the chain places.  I hope yours is great also.
Oh Im so sorry. Is the little one being treated?
I am so sorry to hear that. Im sure she had the bests life she could being part of your family.
you going one last time ?
Oh no. Do you know who did it?
A hit and run. Not many people are responsible anymore.
Me too people can be so cruel.
It definitely can be.
that is scary! it happened to me as well so i bought a couple of guns
yep us too its sad we have to have those
Its always nice to have people around you that care about you. They make hard times much easier.
Hows the wrist feeling now? Any permanent damage?
Well take it from me I have one and twins on the way.... Never wanted kids either but once theyre here its an amazing feeling!
You will never be ready but enjoy as  much as you can while youre young! lol
So exciting which concert?
Nice! I dont know either band well but sounds exciting!
Good luck! Chess is such an interesting game.
Is he an awesome player too?
That must be nice having a good family.
Do you have any siblings?
That is kind of sad. I hate it when places from your childhood close or are torn down.
Yeah that is too bad.
Oh yea? Howd it go?
Oh no how did mom take it? Did she tease you?
I hate when that happens especially when you have something else pictured.
Are you able to send it back?
I cant imagine. How old is he?
Yeah thats a hard age to separate from a child. They dont really understand. I have to leave my 16 year old sometimes and he jumps for joy.
That is a nice surprise! Do you usually work every weekend?
I am glad you got this one off!
yea they grow up way too fast
That sounds awesome! What band?
They sound rock metal. Hope you have a great time!
ah that sucks! what city?

sounds like a plan
Was there too much work?
Did you get any help?
how was it? get smashed?
crap that sucks! did you have fun?
Oh thats cool!  Who are you going to see?
Hey I saw Breaking Benjamin a couple years ago at an unplugged concert in Nashville!  Youre gonna have some fun!!
Eww thats gross! Poor kid needs to learn some manners!
I bet I would have had to look away!
I think everyone gets nervous. Youll be fine!
It must be an exciting time too.
That is annoying. Do they say anything when you answer?
I dont blame you!
whats his name?
my wife loves that name we have a son that will be 2 in december. if we have another one his name will be knox
Who are you going to see?
That will be a fun concert!
Its nice to hear someone thinking about others. Many people who luck out dont care what happens to others or are grateful for their lot in life.
Sounds like you have a great family.
Tell me about it. Its over 100 almost every day here and its so humid it makes the air feel sticky!
Central Louisiana. Hot and gross out here! Imagine a steaming swamp.
i love Mexican food! salsa is the best
yeah thats true! with a margarita
Oh man your dad sounds awesome.
Does he know that?
Yeah? Thats a good thing! Whats going on in your life right now?
Thats awesome! I very happy for you. I hope you have many good years to come as well.
Oh no I am sorry to hear that.
I hope you can find some comfort during this time!
Not many people are thankful for their family. I am glad you are.
That is good to hear it sounds like you are a very loyal employee.
If you find a place that cares for their people stay with them!
You must be excited! Will it go on the whole day?
Thats still awesome. Have a great time!
what are you playing?
wow that is impressive!!
Sometimes that is good and sometimes it is bad. Depends on how bad you need the money. I hope it was a good thing for you.
Yeah I had forgot it was Friday. I always enjoyed getting off early then.
good luck! need something bigger?
yea i feel your pain! we will be buying a bigger home also
That sounds fun what concert?
I bet you are going with your dad?
glad to hear that! why?
your husband is a lucky guy!
Wow that sounds lovely where are you headed? Some where warm I hope!
That sounds amazing I hope you both enjoy it!
You go for it! 
You never know unless you ask and it never hurts to ask!
Why? What did he do?
Wow that is very nice of him. Its to meet nice guys these days! Youre lucky to have him!
oh no!!! Did you put it in rice? 
Sure!  Then cook the rice later!
Thats great! Where ya headed?
I hope you have a wonderful time!
i have never tried korean food  and i love trying different kinds of food i would be so excited

Hey the party was probably worth it.
Thats dope. Whos playing?
Dont know who they are.
that always stinks i hate being short handed 
man that will be great working long shifts aint fun
Fishing is truly fun. We occasionally go with my friends too. Do you go frequently?
That is bad. Do you live in a place with high humidity?
you ever cut it yourself ? or is it too big of a yard?
yea sometimes its relaxing to be out there cutting the grass by yourself 
Thats awful I hope no one in your family was hurt.
Luckily. In bad situations like that it is always best to remind ourselves that things could have been a lot worse for ourselves.
That sounds like a lot of fun! Who are you going to see?
Awesome! They play some good music!
whoa thats shocking! how old is she?
holy smokes thats a huge gap!
we always do that its so convenient 
no way its awesome!
Youre gonna be tired the next day.
Too bad its on a Sunday.
Thats great how long was it on for?
That is a pretty long time to have your leg wrapped up. Howd you injure it?
Yea. After all that I think its definitely time for you to relax and have fun!
You should be proud of yourself really.
Hey thats a good deal!  Where was this?
Yeah that sounds sooooo good right now!  I may need to go to chinese tonight!!
Oh no. Can you go back?
Im sure youll do fine if you practice enough!
Understandably so I get nervous during presentations too. Take some deep breaths and youll pull through!
Is that a play or music band?
that is the worst i hate when people cant park
i know the feeling there are a ton of people like that too
that sounds cool.. how long has he been competing ?
Its lovely! did you miss him?
Take care of him!
Yeah me too! Is your friend working abroad too?
Okay interesting. Well I would guess that she is probably studying right no!
Everyone has their preference.
Aw no luck with the ladies?
whats tomorrow night?
awesome i love mma what fighter you like?
Aww thats good for him though!  Who was the band?
Thats an awesome band.  So jealous of him!!!  Wish we couldve ALL went!
Is it the traffic or driving that gives you anxiety?
Oh gosh. Thats not safe at all. 
thats awesome  one day i want to make it to retirement im happy to hear people work this long in my area young people refuse to work all they do is party and live off there familys money
thanks  and once again thank you for your service in any field contributing to society 
Why were you scared to walk home?
That is pretty terrifying but Im happy to see that you made it through in one piece.
Wow that sounds like fun! Shes so beautiful.
Yes she does. Shes very talented. Id love to see her live.
That is so scary! People are so desperate these days.
I would have been too. I am glad you are okay!
Is that a football team?  Im sorry Im not a sports fan.  Are they your favorite team?
I hope they perform well this year then!  Its always nice to have a winning team.
its sad once you get older those things dissapear
dirty 30 parties are the best!
What got in the way of your plans?
Thats such a shame Im sorry to hear that.
Oh no! Did anyone help you?
Yeah I can imagine
That is horrible. Do you live in a city or rural areas?
It is unbelievable to meet these wild animals in a city. You should definitely call them
bosses can be such aholes!
yep if it deserves to be yelled at thats one thing
Im a Reds fan myself........I know the Braves have a good chance of winning their division and I agree probably not made for a deep playoff ren.
Yeah....I have no complaints with him.....his salary is too big for the franchise but that aint his fault.
You must have felt very lonely.
At least you were productive!
what did he tell you ? did he like them as well
when my brother loves the things i love  it makes me feel good like we are bonding 
thats a shame! did he get any of it back?
thats good my house was also broken in to
Hey Its never too late. Unless you cant exercise at all there is always a way to start. 
Dont worry about the calories for now. Just start moving more and maybe join an exercise class. Youll start to enjoy it and before you know it the weight will just start dropping off!
Its not good to be stuck alone. Im sure you can make friends with someone there!
Take it from me youve got to work on getting over that shyness before its too ingrained in you! Im still pretty introverted but I enjoy meeting new people now and it helps with my emotional state a ton.
Oh no!  How are you handling the disappointment?
Thats a great attitude to have about it.  But I understand that it still stings a bit.  
That is a big moment. Are you a little sad?
I would be a mess my son is about to turn two and I am sad about that. Time goes by so fast.
what were you going to get?
i have one and it is awesome
Yeah? How much of a chance do you think they have?
That would be awesome! I hope they do too!
Who knows they always choke.
Maybe this year will be their year.
that stinks! hopefully you will get one soon
maybe itll all work out for you!
lol.  Put some headphones on yourself and tune him out!
Maybe you could play your own video games?
Oh.  Maybe watch some cool youtube vids?
Thats awesome! Mine has been just fine not bad
I hope it continues!
Do you even have a dog?
Thats so disgusting. You should catch them one day and drag them to the police station.
oh nice! she will be in my town this weekend
i have hear so as well i love concerts
Yeah they seem to be doing good this year.
Hopefully so maybe they can make a good run this year.
that is so awesome! are you going to pass it down to a family member
that would be so nice to have!
Do you live in Atlanta?  I havent been to the new stadium yet and I really would like to  have you?
Well hello neighbor!  Im going to have to get down there one day  I remember way back when they won the World Series I think in 1991 maybe?  It was so exciting!
You think so?   
Awesome!  Ill have to check them out this year.  Im a cowboys fan LOL
what did you get?
extra money is always great!
Thats great. I guess he might be one year old. Am I right?
Good. He is fast growing child! 
What kind are you looking to get?
Awesome are you adopting?
I am glad you are getting to leave. I hope you find somewhere safe. 
That sounds like a plan.

you made my day  hope everything goes well 
lol dude is living the life
lol he has no cares which is always good
Thats great! What kind of show?
Oh sweet! Id love to go to one of their shows myself. I hope you have a great time.
Good credit and debt are bad things.
What you are saying is true. Me too I hate paying fpr interests.
Take the knife and destroy it the next time it lands. That way they will learn a valuable lesson
Kids can be annoying and such outcomes can teach them on how to properly behave
Hey thats amazing!!  What did you major in?
Thats pretty cool!   Im so glad for you!  I bet that was a lot of paper writing D
That sounds fun those are always exciting.

thats sad i hate to hear that
Are they doing good so far?
Thats awesome!  I hope they win it all !  They really are a great team.
Oh no! Did they steal a lot?
I bet! Did they damage anything?
That is nice. How long have you been married?
are you confident you will pass?
great! i hope that you do!
I dont blame you that is so scary! I am glad you are okay.
I hope they do too. That is a dangerous person.
Thats really awesome. Your friends sound really great!
Make sure you do something good for them in return!
I bet it was nice to have extra help.
Your sister sounds pretty awesome
Oh no!  I know how violated that can make you feel  did they ever get caught?
I can understand that!  Otherwise you are just wondering all the time who it is and if they will come back.  I hope you were able to get some security systems in place to help feel more at ease.
Yeah the new places are always really busy when they first open too!
Yeah same here
where you going ?
nice  i have a friend who lives in florida hope you all enjoy it there
I know right. I miss seeing the phone booths everywhere. 
Wow! I havent thought about them in years. I cant remember the last time I saw one. 
My daughter is thinking about that career track.  Is it hard though when an animal doesnt make it?
That would be the only thing that would keep me from it.  I admire those that care for our animals so thanks to you for being you.
That sounds like fun. How do you feel about it?
what beach are you going to?
i was born in savannah!
I dont know much about baseball but I went to a Braves game a few weeks ago and it was fun
Yes it is! We walked all around it

i agree they have regard for anyone else
Why are you saying like this?
indeed they are so good
Holy cow thats amazing!!  Do you think youll like this new job?
Thats really great!  Im happy for you!  Knockem dead!
Did you guys have a nice celebration?
I love catfish! Im glad you were able to enjoy a nice celebration with your mom.
Oh that is the best. Its so nice to have a great friend. 
I can see that. But she loves you for you and not for what you can afford. 
I am the same lol I walk fast. Too fast sometimes
LOL you get there faster
Dont worry though. He will be home soon!
Thats wonderful that you are looking out for them like that.
Awesome! Im sure they will all do their best!
Those dont sound like friends. Id be extremely pissed off!
Yeah dont let them lie to you. I dont know them obviously but that sounds like an excuse to me too.
What were they looking for?
I cant imagine how anxious that must have made you. I am glad it turned out to be benign. 
Im sorry to hear that. Thats a pretty common response to break ups. A lot of people go through it so youre not alone! I hope you pull through soon.
Thats great to hear! Im sure youll find someone better soon.
hell no it does not  these people out here stealing that is exactly why im afraid of buying from e bay  a lot of bad reviews 
i would be really upset too  i have received defective merchandise too and its upsetting  waiting for the product for 1 week and checking the mail every day  only to get it broken
Oh congratulations! Thats wonderful news.
I am very happy for you. I wish you all the best!
Yum I love buffets!
Yes so many options
That is such a bummer have you spoken to him about this issue?
That may be a issue I mean you want to trustt your significant other but as women we know the changes and signs trust me.
Oh that is great! Were you High School sweethearts?
That is a great accomplishment since most marriages dont last very long. Congrats! 
Oh. I love red hairs. I have always admired their unique genetic characteristic that sets apart from others
You know what i have always secretly wanted to date red hair as a partner and I hope I will one day
Oh no!  Have you spoken to her at all since she left?
That is so sad to hear!  Perhaps after she cools down a bit yall will be able to work it out.
Yes it is. Its like you turn around and 10 years has gone by. 
Wouldnt that be great. Think of all the changes we could make. 
Thats incredible! You must feel on top of the world!
Im sure all the hard work and effort you put in to it really shows. I am trying to get in shape myself and your story is inspiring!
Im so sorry to hear that do you try andspend a lot of time with her so she doesnt feel that way?
That is great to hear now she has to build even more memories with you and your family so the loosing of your dad can get better for her.
Whats happening next month?!
Oh wow! Thats awesome. What beach are you going to?
Uh oh!!!  Better go investigate!
Yeah that would suck.  You should throw some peanuts or corn up there.
haha do it!  Not like youll be sleeping tonight anyway!
haha YES!  Sounds like a fun Friday night D
Oh no! Maybe you can plan to enjoy a picnic the following weekend.
Sorry to hear that. Hope the weather is better next time!
Oh thats cool! What kind of concert is it?
Oh thats a big one! That should be an amazing show!
Oh no! I hope it wasnt something that caused you real distress. 
OMG! Bless your heart. I hope they feel guilty now knowing what they did to you. 
Nothing like mail to brighten up your day! What was it?
What a great gift! I have always wanted a Polaroid instant camera!
Did he arrive back early?
I bet you were extremely happy. A year without seeing a parent can be a very lonely feeling.
That is so sad. I am sorry. Losing a pet is so hard. They are family.
I know the feeling. The thought of replacing them seems impossible. Only time will tell if you are ever ready for another.
That is so awesome and a great accomplishment do you plan to write more in the future? 
Science was never my strongest but I admire those who love it because they are super smart I hope your next article makes it into a even bigger news article. 
Yikes! You got one of the bad ones. They sure makes things hard. 
Maybe he needs to break away from her a bit. Maybe then she will mind her own business. 
Thats awesome! Will it be your first time?
Nice its always fun even if youve been before.
ugh I hate when that happens... when I worked in retail my boss always called me
I actually liked retail but the customers and the schedule sucks lol
Did you?  How did that work out?
Oh no    Im so sorry.   Theres always adoption!
OO are you going to the beach soon?
That should be so much fun seeing his face when he first puts his feet in the water will be amazing!
Wow that is awesome! How long does that take?
That is really great! Your fitness and health are very important to take care of.
what you planning on giving her ?
shes gonna be very happy  i would do the same for my mom
No I dont. What are the teams playing?
Nice. I didnt know about it.
Well you should call 911. He might be dangerous anytime for the people in the surroundings
you ought to be careful
Glad to hear you found it I know your heart was racing to find it especially if it was your favorite. 
Have to be much more careful next time maybe get a box to put it in. 
Oh no. I hope they will be able to find out soon what is causing them. 
Bless your heart. I hope they find out and its something they can treat it easily. 
Thats nice. Its good to be supportive
That creates a great work environment
Awe how cute! That is such a blessed moment.
Thats really cool to see their development and their growth.
What could you have found in that dark dusty place?
Wow! Great find! I bet you was super happy.
That sounds like a blast. Wish I could be there! 
Sorry to hear that how did things turn out did you two make it work or going through the process now? 
He has to be happy if he still there marriage is important and he has to be open in communication with you instead of pulling the divorce card. 
what was it ? 
lol  we have possums down here  they get in the attic all the time too 
Thats what I like to hear. What do you do for a living?
Ah the good ole side hustle. I like that. You should check out Side Hustle by Chris Guillebeau. Im looking to start something myself. 
That was nice did you ever get the moneyback?
How long ago did you lend them this money?
ah thats being a good brother. Is your brother alright now?
good to hear that!!
Wow  what is the raffle for?
That would be an awesome win!  I think the most Ive ever won was 1 on a scratch off lottery ticket haha!  I hope you win!!
That sounds like fun! Where did you guys end up going?
Thats awesome! I cant wait to take my daughters to disney
every time a loved one dies its never good news  even if its a pet 
i love dogs  they just want someones attention  they are loyal till the end
Whoa that is really impressive! How much do you bench now?
Its cool to always remember those milestones. Helps to keep us motivated.
oh! thats really fabulous
why what is the reason ?
Oh no that is heartbreaking.  How is she and her mother holding up?
I cant even imagine.  I hope she has some great men in her life that can help to be that father figure for her.
That sounds very nostalgic. How old is she now? 
It is indeed. I wish i could back to my childhood times. No hassle no stress of paying bills. Adulthood is really difficult
Yeah i feel some are just picky on what job they want to have
i have to stay late at work all the time  im sorry to hear that 
yes it does lol
Im sorry  what exam are you talking about?  Did you take an exam?
Do you think you did well on it?
lol sounds like a cool type of work
oh why is that?
oh it sounds fun. You should try it once. You will enjoy it. You will be scared for the first time but you will be okay
Hey thats awesome!  Where are you going for vacation??
Oh Im so jealous!  I bet that place is beautiful!!
Maybe you can park a bicycle or skateboard there.
Dang! Tell your friend to go find a new spot!
Oh wow! That is great. Did she have a good day?
I dont blame you. Its so sad to know that you have to leave them there. 
thats good  was it a 1.00 scratch off ?
i would be happy too  but i would probably buy 20 tickets after and lose in every single one with my luck
YEs because they never want to hang out unless they bring their partner lol
Ive been in that situation many times lol
Thats awesome! I hope you do great.
I bet you had some good times when she was a baby!  How old is she now?
haha I bet shes a doll!  Cherish these moments!
I am sorry maybe you can hang out with some friends
I hope you feel better!
Oh no!!! Is she okay?
Wow! That is gross did you kill it?
I hope you lit it on fire!
Such things are very rare if you use services from reputable delivering companies. What carrier did you use for your delivery?
It is very unusual. UPS is very competitive company and they should have resolved the issue quickly
Oh no! Did you get a police report and exchange information?
Its always good to exchange the information to make sure that they follow up about that. Hope your car gets fixed soon.
That is definitely something to celebrate!
Do you have big plans?
Oh no thats a horrible feeling
Uh oh! Maybe time to move on
What is going to happen in September?
Wow! I bet he will love that. 
That is great that you are going to take him. He will always remember it. 
That is great news. What job was it for?
When will you know if you got the job?
Yes dont give upQ! I bet youll find something good
oh i know what you mean
thats very annoying
Whoa were you in a hurry? Did something happen?
Luckily nothing happened but better to be safe while driving.
Well that will be great! Where are yall going?
We just got back from there 2 weeks ago we stayed at Miramar Beach. Im sure it will be a lot of fun and relaxation!
Right. What is the purpose of going to movies if people talk there. Uninformed people everywhere
You should confront them next time if it happens. They should be put in their place for improper social behavior
Are you going to get it fixed?
Will she give you any money for the repair?
Oh Im sorry to hear that. Its very hard to lose a loved one I know from personal experience.
Yes even though death is part of life its very hard. I hope things are better for you.
Awe shucks what stopped you?
Well I do hope you get to have your hike soon! Im sure if you keep putting in the work it will pay off eventually.
oh well whats the show. i know for sure you would have enjoyed it again
nostalgic isnt it?
That is terrible news. How did he die?
I lost my friend to a heart attack. He was only 35.
Oh really? I can imagine
oh thats too bad but i bet you will do fine
Oh well that doesnt sound good. But maybe you have good reasons?
Oh well in all honesty it probably wont last if hes a bad guy anyway.
Oh no how did that make you feel?
It happens. But next time youll be more aware
Well thats very sweet of him! 
I always love surprises like that. And a new laptop is a pretty big deal. Enjoy it!
oh i didnt get a chance to see the game
wow thats insane
What did you do after they cut you off?
Did you at least honk your horn?
That sounds so annoying to deal with.
Without a doubt most drivers are total morons.
ah that bad!!. You need again to wait for ages!!
When you see them again it will be worth a wait!!
wow good for you man
dang that is so awesome
Did you make friends eventually?
How did you get through it?
Im not sure Ive ever used them. I think my earliest music media was cassettes.
Thats cool. The history of them are as well Sometimes its nice to use something from the past.
Thats awesome. Howd he do?
Nice. I bet you were so proud.
You definitely should cherish these moments.
How did your sister react?
How did that make you feel?
Thats alright. Shes family so she will still love you. Just learn from this mistake. 
Oh wow why?
Damn hopefully youre doing better now.
What went wrong?
Did you use Tinder again?
With Trump in the presidency it wont end soon.You can bet on that
You know nothing about politics go watch soap operas
So you consider yourself total loser in life?
It is pathetic and unacceptable. You should grow up and stop being so irresponsible
Did it hurt?
Did you go to the doctor?
yea thats fair ive done the same thing
haha that might be too far
that was my favorite game ever
same it was awesome
Thats pretty good reflexes on his part.
So many of my friends have cracked phones so I guess mine are clumsier. 
Same! That is why I never go outside and just be on my computer all day!
You got this! Fake it until you make it!
Maybe you shouldnt go then.
Hopefully nothing bad will happen.
ah so sad for you where did heshe moved?
oh yeah nice pace though but you will miss him a lot i guess!!
I imagine that was a big surprise! Did you ever mention to him?
Well I can relate. My sister and I found some playboy magazines nosing around too!
I am sure there will be another chance.
Maybe you should buy him lunch to make a peace offering.
What happened? Is there anything specific that makes you feel that way?
Then why dont you go shopping? Is it because you have financial difficulties?
I somewhat disagree. Its been so hot Ill be happy to see the end of summer.
That is a pretty good tradeoff.
Is the phone working?
Did he get dirty when he dove?
oh that must be scary
wow well good luck
I would think they are now. Are they already closed down for the summer?
Oh I see. Well they are a lot of fun!
What makes you think that?
Thats pretty much the same reason that I dont want kids.
I never use Tinder due to that reason.
Have you ever tried any other apps?
Yikes!  Did you study real hard for it?
Aww.  I think you will do okay!
thats so cool good for him
How come. I cant imagine weddings without the presence of parents. You should convince her to come
But it is you who choose which girl to marry and which one not. You should try to explain it to her that old days are over
Have you studied?
You will do fine I know it.
Sounds like a fun event. What all is there to it?
Yes that would be quite fun! My children will not go to haunted house no matter how much we try to bribe them lol
Thats so great! Most people arent.
I know some people that eat healthy but still struggle with their weight. So thats great you dont!
Wow so far Ive just had a girlfriend for a week and got laid a few times.
True though I just wish girls werent so shallow sometimes.
That is good you shouldnt even go on Tinder.
That wasnt ever nice of her.
Really?  Ive always wanted to see them!  When did you go
Awesome!  So glad theyre still rocking after all these years!
Where do you shop?
Where is the trip to?
oh thats really cool good luck
seems like a tough sport
Did you apologize to them?
It ok mistakes happen.
You should go out and meet new people.
Do you have friends now?
yea i agree
they are important to the ecosystem but i wish they would stay away from me
When is the test?
That is good you must of studied a long time.
wow that must have been a huge moment for you
well good for you
Uh ohh!  Did you honk at them?
Yeah.  Id say so.  I cant stand bad drivers!
oh man mustve brought back memories
wow that sucks so bad
You can at least phone them.
You can go visit.
Nice association. Do you have any memory attached to it?
Do you visit her often?
Thats so wonderful! I had a very close relationship with my sister too. I always treasured it and loved her so much!
Thats so great. My sister was mine too. She passed away several years ago so never take him for granted and treasure every moment with him!
oh wow that sounds really tough
well good luck with that
That is horrible news so sorry.
How did he die?
oh you did? what was it about?
dang thats a bit low
Did you pull over to help?
That was nice of you.
What did they do to make you proud?
That is good news. What kind of job?
Oh no when did that happen?
How old are you? Its more rough when youre young.
is there a chance you wont?
hopefully you get it
Why? Must be something fun and exciting going on?
Oh well no doubt that will be fun! I like that it isnt fake like wrestling.
That is great you have friends.
How often do you see them.
thats so cool.
thats great happy for you
Same here he must make so much money.
I totally agree.
Why was that?
Is that a good thing or a bad thing?
oof was it the cost?
yikes thats quite a sum of money
Did you call a tow truck? LOL.
Did you ice your toe?
Thats great! But what is it?
Oh okay! Well I love some Blackjack. I like Poker but better at Blackjack. But not on your level by any means! Good for you!
Oh that sucks!  Why did heshe make you work??
Yeah Ive worked for bosses like that in the past.  At least you get overtime?
Thats cool. Is he smart?
What position does he play?
Are they? Damn I cant believe I didnt hear.
Agreed that would be badass.
What was the name of the film?
I love that movie.
Oh well it happens sometimes and cant be helped. But I understand why it would make you feel bad too!
Im sure it probably upset them but maybe they realize it was for a reason. And Im sure theyve done the same thing.
wow thats impressive
Did anyone get hurt?
Did you yell at the other person?
wow thats so horrible
Wow that is pretty cool
And when did this happened?
Thats awesome!  College or high school?
Thats great to hear!  What is his major?
Yes I have many great weeks.
What happened to make it great?
Did you not study for it?
Hopefully you learned a lesson from this experience. If you want to do well you need to be prepared.
That was nice of her!
Make sure to tell her that!
I could imagine. Were you two very close?
Its good to have that close bond with your siblings though.
What is the issue?
Wont you still be able to see her?
ah you used her. You should have filled. But however she will understand
oh moms will be mom. she will forgive you
Do you like it?
Which color is it?
How many people entered?
That isnt a lot of people but still a good job.
I dont think I know that band. But Im sure you will have lots of fun!
Well there ya go I didnt know. The Weeknd sounds like a band more than just one person.
Anything in particular?
You need to catch up.
Your high school yearbook?
When do you think it will happen?
You think so?  Do you have a plan for the end of the world?
Oh? What made you so mad?
Oh I hate that too. Just let me buy what I need to buy and leave.
Did you manage to get it?
As long as you keep the GPA to what you need though
I am glad for you
OMG...how gross. What did you do?
LOL....I think thats when I would start crying.
Whats happening next week?
Really! They are so much fun
DEfinitely. Its an adrenalin rush
Sticks and stones..
Hey thats great!  That makes for an awesome day.  Its not quite daylight here yet.
Yeah.  Its usuallty around 0600 here when it gets light.  Its only 3 here now though
Yeah Im sure it will.  Enjoy your beautiful day!
Thank you so much D
That is kinda sad
Did you talked to her after?
Ew thats pretty gross since the floor is probably dirty as hell.
Especially in public when people can see you do it.
LOL well they must have been very good then. We all overindulge at times so dont feel too bad.
Well it can be hard to resist sometimes. But maybe just eat a bit healthier for a few days and itll make up for it.
OH yeah! Its so painful. Did you do that today?
Things will get better from here on out
They call that Post traumatic Stress Disorder
I think you should
Im sure youre gonna nail it!   What is the job?
Have you worked in one before?
Cool.  So you have some good experience.  Id say this new job is yours!  Good luck!
Youre welcome my friend.   Its their loss if they dont hire you!
Every single one? Thats messed up.
I wouldnt wish that on my worst enemy.
Wow that is a good friend
Nice did you passed the test?
That situation can make you apprehensive. What would be making him upset?
I think that your Dad will be more concerned about you being injured than scolding you. Go home.
Oh thats bad. you should have really given them your piece of mind. Driving skills of people going down
yeah thats good really
Cool  how did it go?
Good. Have you arranged to meet again?
Brilliant. Its like having a new friend.
Was it that bad?
And why was that?
Was it good news?
Thats has to be a relief. Hopefully he wont fall off the wagon. With alcoholism its one day at a time.
Thats the worst especially when you see employees doing nothing.
Well thankfully its over now.
Do you think you could overcome it?
I cheer for you to make it
Well it would have been nostalgic!!. You would have enjoyed for sure
old is gold saying is so true. All our memories comes up.
Did you passed the test?
Oh Im so sorry can yo retake the test?
Thats nice of him! How long did it take?
Not bad at all!
Thats great. How old is she?
Lol. Do you see a lot of her?
LOL....Been there and done that. Dont feel guilty. Whats done is done.
No need beating yourself up something you cant change. Got another pack?
Why does he need surgery then?
I hope it does too!
oh feel sorry for you. I just hope you will get it next time
you will get it dont you worry about it
When is the interview?
I hope you get the job
What is the job about?
Oh very good I work with a charity too
Thats terrible. Some people are scumbags.
Did you contact the police?
Sounds like a perfect day.
Glad to hear it I hope I have a day like that soon.
Do you know how to do it correctly now though?
Well  you live and learn.
Oh I wouldve freaked out
Sounds like a safer option any idea on how it got in?
Perhaps it would be wise to close them at night
Perhaps then put something so they cannot get in
Well done! What kind of car did you get?
Wow. Are you happy with it?
I wish I was patient enough to save like that
Im impressed. You should be proud of yourself.
Thats great. How old is he now?
Im pleased for him. Hopefully hell be the next Usain Bolt.
Chain of command do work. We cant help it I feel the same
Indeed it ought to be
What kind of dead bodies?
I understand your feelings.
If they dont want to have anything to do with you because you are poor then they are pretty shallow and dispicable. Ive still got the pigs if you want to get rid of them.
Why did it make you upset?
Wow he must be pretty loaded.
Ive never even owned a car never mind an Audi!
It does any recent event that made you feel like that?
Oh I am happy for you
Awesome congrats was this during a college course?
Was is a general eduaction class or one towards your major?
Well good luck for you. you dont like your old one?
i am sure you will get it. I pray for you
No. Why not?
Thats important. Maybe youre right to stick with it there.
Oh wow that sounds like something I wouldnt do
Why was he doing it
Other countries sure are weird
Really? What game did you get?
Is it good?
Yeah  feels better when youve paid for it yourself.
So she should be. WEll done.
Is it your favorite necklace?
What car did you get?
Good. Well done. When do you find out?
Oh what kind of pizza?
That sounds so good!
I hope you are prepared
Everything will go fine all you have to do is be yourself
Really? Thats disgusting
Me neither. I spoke to someone who had seen a show about a guy eating a live squid. Yuck!
Some of them
You will be just fine.
that sucks!! you should have been really annoyed with the delivery boy!
Yeah!! you should refused to take the pizza and returned it
You can only do your best in an unexpected situation.
Its like Larry Gelwix says Whats Important Now?  what is the best course of action right this second to improve performance. Its inspiring.
Was it from someone you knew?
What made him not speak well in your eyes?
That seems like he needs to be let go then.
Oh thats awful to hear how did yo react?
Oh that sounds like an awful lie what did you do after?
Were they trying to steal from your car?
I would be too so thats understandable.
Oh did you go?
Then all is well.
Is it for a hourly wage job or salary?
Was it in a field that you wanted to be in or just because you needed a job?
Once or twice. What happened to make you ask?
Thats terrible  recently?
Is it an absolute mess inside?
Such a shame. 
That is really impressive.
I could use some burgers myself right now.
That is terrible my friend.
I feel so bad for you.
Oh that is awful did it sting you?
Oh Im glad where was it?
Thats quiet funny though
Yeah  what did she do?
Really? Was it good? Ive never eaten there.
Good. What did you have?
Oh what did you get?
That sounds really cool.
Did you lose weight?
Oh damn! How long ago was that?
Hopefully that isnt too big an issue.
Oh no. Will you get it back OK?
Its frustrating when that sort of thing happens
Things will get better.
Do you cheer for a specific team or just watch the matches?
Oh thats pretty cool are they good?
Really? Did they find out?
Did you not feel that you should admit it? How did you accidentally eat it anyway?
You are a terrible person. If someone ate my cake Id be heartbroken!
Buy him another cake. 
I guess no. Have you?
Awful. It doesnt happen to anyone. 
How many counties are you planning on vistiing?
That is a bad cat.
Did you clean it up?
homeless people can be good sometimes but sometimes its just annoying
Arrgg  so annoying. 
Did you shout at him?
a bit late for that
Really? What was the address? No  only joking. 
Oh yeah? What was on it?
Ooo thats nice of them!
That is the worst thing ever.
I hope things get better.
Oh man thats a bummer how did that happened?
Was she honest about it or did you find out the hard way?
Me too. Who do you support?
I hope they do well for you
Perhaps some pigs helped you out with that?
You are so brilliant.
oh wow thats awesome i did the same last month it was nice
Oh wow thats crazy super cool tho
awesome! i will pray go for your work to be assigned to you
ok dude it was too late i have to go home else my mom will scold me
Why do you think about it then?
That seems weird to me
Thats annoying. Why is she doing that?
Oof that isnt good sorry to hear man.
Really? Its a nice car to drive.
Me too! Must have cost a lot.
That sounds so amazing!
Really? Cool. What did you do?
Ahh  so they were like a free gift?
Its pity. But why are you alone?

i can imagine my condolences 
Im glad you understand your actions.
Oh thats amazing news
Was it a big promotion?

I understand you will miss home but also excited for college.
I agree but you will get to see them again when you come back!
Oh that makes sense arent academics huge in asian culture?
Good to hear that he is performing so well.
sounds shameful yet amazing
Thats fair enough took many biscuits bad for the health
Really? Like a mugger?
Good of you you are a nice person.
So looks like you wont be getting your money back any time soon!
Have you had it for long?
Wow! Thats a classic. Why do you need to sell it?
yea i would be sad
Wow thats hardcore are you alright?
I wouldve thought the same is your house ok?
Oh no! Was it OK?
Its nasty. Did you have to clean it up or did someone else?

I know right! Go Tottenham!
This is will be a great season!

Oh my how did you manage to get out of that situation? Did you hitch a ride?
Phew! Good have ended a lot worse if that gas station wasnt there.
Thats cool of them! How was it?
Oh thats awkward haha.
Oh not good how did that happened?
I could imagine it was did someone got hurt?
Were they being rude to you?
Ugh! She was probably doing it on purpose to annoy you!
yea it feels so bad
wow that really sucks im sure you will bounce back
Is she sick or was it was one time thing?
Was it a new rug
Scumbag! How can we find out who?
There must be some way. Lets look at the suspects.
Why are you so lonely?
Oh you and your silly pigs.
That is so great of you.
I am very happy for you.
good luck with that then
Why you say that?
That is such a shame to hear you could try having an imaginary friend
He sounds like a bad influence
Good dont get rid of the only friend you have
Maybe youve still got time to do some prep.
Is tehre anyone you could ask to help you prepare?
well the odds are quite bad but that still sucks
Nice have you heard back yet?
Hopefully you will get it if you prepared well!
That must be such an amazing feeling!
Well Im really happy for you man.
Good thing is you had an alternative. How did your date go?
I hope you can find a way to convince her if you really like or love her
Oh how did that go?
That is an interesting meeting.
You too? One of mine died from food poisoning recently. What are you going to do?
You know what they say dont you? You can always buy a new pig  just dont under any circumstances involve the cops
Did you have notecards?
Was it about a proposal?
I think I have it made me feel bad. have you?
Do you feel bad about it now? I think you do but sometimes we have to do hard things in life.
Oh did you get it?
I wish you all the best.
How did that go then?
Id hope so too!
i bet it did
Yuck. I suppose some people need to do that to survive though
Really? Did you say anything to them?
What did they say?
Oh so scary what was it?
Oh sounds like you should replace it
Oh my that is so disgusting. Why would you watch something like that?
Oh I see I dont think I would be able to eat something like that!
Yeah  how old were you?
What game did you have?
Dang thats annoying.  Is there anyway you can still get a similar job?
Yeah thats understandable.
yea nostalgia is a real kicker
Thats really strange of them haha.
Yeah  what will you be studying?
Ahh  when you are home do you have to share?
wow thats quite rude of them
Aw did you feel lonely? I was like that too but I found friends in my second year.
Dont worry hit the gym and join student clubs.
That should be a crime!
I would be too it must have tasted disgusting! What a waste of nachos. 
What did the voice say?
I thought the voice was telling you to feed the pigs again.
oh really? that makes me feel rubbish too
def worth it
Oh. Im sorry to hear that. Did you know him well?
Yeah  it can be upsetting
maybe buy one then? gotteeem
5 likes in the chat?

Whopped in the beak by that glass.
You must have felt hopeful where did you apply?
I see I think you will get the job
Really  recently? The temperature there can get REALLY high cant it?
What kind of treasure?
oh that sounds quite nice
What cartoon was it?
Oh those were the good old days.

I would be too so thats fair.
Sounds pretty unfun to me
Glad to hear that the studying paid off
yea i know how that feels
yea it feels extra bad
wow thats awesome must feel nice

Do you feel bad about it? You should be more careful next time.
As you should bee. but its okay we are all human and make human mistakes some times.
dang thats impressive
Man thats the worst.
Feels so good man
He must be a good player!
You must be a great parent!
Oh no you must have been very scared. 
Did you get away? Why was the dog chasing you in the first place?
Why dont they eat lunch with you?
That does not sounds good! Are you proud of him for standing up?
I am glad for him. Bullies should not be allowed to behave badly towards others.
Thats good how old is your son?
Oh he is quite a grown man. I bet you wanted to catch up on old time growing up with him
Do you have certain expectations for your son?
Thats something for which to be proud!  Why dont you feel good about it?
Oh that sucks.  What is it that she does?
Theyre professional naggers.  Its just what they do.
That awesome must have been a proud moment for you both.
That sucks. Is there no way of getting them out?
foids are trash ree
get me some dat respect
Thats good to hear that his hard work paid off
True a month is not too long.
oof those memories can hurt
Nice! I hope you feel happy for him and not jealous! 
Yup hard work tends to do that.
That is so terrible.
I hope he learns his lesson.
So sorry to hear that. You must feel sad.
Time will heal. Remember you dog for all the good memories. 
Congratulations thats great news. How did you propose?
Yeah man it would have sucked if she said no.
Why does she get you angry?
I hope things get better you two.
Oh no that must have been awkward 
Does he know that that was the job you wanted?
i am the same
Sounds like you had a bad experience. What happened in Washington?
Oh goodness! How did you react?
Wow it has served you well
Yes you do that buddy
You must have prepared well in advance to not be nervous!
Good for you! Hard work always pays off buddy.
Thats nice of her!  I bet you were shocked when you saw everybody!
Thats awesome its nice to feel loved.
Thats really nice to hear I hope it goes well.
Oh no that sounds really scary!
Luckily you werent hurt though!
It must have been a very hard decision for you.
I hope so too it will take hard work but its possible.
i feel so worried about this its impossible to stay for 15days
oh thank god you were escape you have to thank god for doing great things
oh yea same
seems super cool
I hope you are feeling better.
yea i know that tilts me so hard
yea i bet he is
Thats good think youre gonna get an A?
Yeah hopefully you do pretty well at least.
I was as well. What was it that impressed you most?
Definitely. Hopefully the next World Cup will surprise just as much.
Whys that? Do you think people will assume you are stealing?
Thats terrible. I could see how that would stay with you.
Wow that sounds like one tough cookie!
Yeah thats nice but at some point you have to learn your own limits.
oh thats nice its a happy thing to expect a child
Thats not too nice did you punish him?
Hopefully this was just a one time thing.
I hate eating dinner by myself.  What happened that you ended up eating dinner alone?
I dont like being alone much either.  What would cause you to have bad thought?  Were you scared?
Its hard to hold back the truth sometimes.
Sounds like a lot of hard work.
Thats not acceptable even if he is drunk.
I hope you get to set him straight somehow.
You must be very happy now.
I hope you keep it forever.
yea no problem
Eww did you get angry with her?
I hope you didnt abandon her.
I hate cats that throw up.
I am sure your shoes can be cleaned.
yea hopefully you find it
I know. It seems like Ive been up early every weekend for a while now. Really wish I could sleep in!
What can you do when your body refuses to cooperate eh?
Why were you so down on yourself about failing?
Thats not a great attitude as you at least must give a go. You only fail if you dont try.
To your partners you mean?
You should find a way to be satisfied with just one person.
Thats a great gesture! Is this for your first child?
Definitely. Congratulations and good luck!
Yeah we all were at some point.
i would be to
Im sorry to hear that. Have you tried to talk to a professional about that?
Thats terrible. I hope the situation sorts itself out.
Thats intense what for?
Thats awful I hope she turns out alright.
You should be confident. 
I am proud of you!
Thats good! Keep it up. Its hard to follow routine sometimes
Itll pay off in the end
Same here though it is the summer for me.
I guess so though Im tired so I want to sleep.
LOOOLLL Im the same way I hate their lack of willpower!
Yeah at what point would you not look yourself in the mirror and be disgusted?
I think people find a way to lie to themself and convince themselves that it isnt that bad.  body dismorphia.
So sorry that must be devastating for you. 
How long does he have left?
Why do you get embarrassed?
I bet you are great at it!
Yuck thats disgusting did you throw up?
Was he insane or was it a part of hes culture? 
yes! pizza is on of lifes simple joys  what is your favorite kind of pizza?
ohhh yes NY style is thin crust right?
I am so proud of you!
I wish you the most success!
Yes! thats so fun are you excited?
HAHAHAH she probably has no idea whats going on.
No way! hahaha How did you find out?
How embarrassing! lol
omg it must have been quite an experience for you
I hope he is alright now
What do you mean? is everything okay?
WOW! he never came back? thats hilarious and terrible.
Oh thats sad are you going somewhere?
Oh yeah I remember that.  Pretty tough.
Yes! me and my buddy go camping every year when it cools off.
Yeah its been WAY to hot here lately to do anything.
That sounds so scary!
Im sorry heights are the worst.
OH NO! I would have been runnning up and down the halls yelling.
Did you find out who did it and publicly spray ketchup all over them.
Sorry to hear that thats disappointing when people pull out last minute.
Did you let them know how you felt?
Yes may very well be gay. Nothing wrong with that.  Ive had alot of gay friends.
If you just stay confident and believe in yourself I know you can do it!
Enjoy your time there!
What did you eat? was it delicious.
Pizza is my lifeblood along with beer.
Were you excited or annoyed that the driver left them there?
I know the feeling when you get the items you ordered. I think the anticipation os more exciting then actually having them.
yes they are so soft and fun to cuddle to.
HA if only If only people told you what they wanted like dogs do.
That is the case for me too!
Yeah I know that feeling.
Wow thats a long time to wait for pizza.
did you complain? Or at least ask for a discount.
Was there anything in the pockets?
haha the best would have been the girls phone number
HAHA yes all the time and its even worse when they speak.
Ugh yes like cant you tell from my body language I dont want to talk.
I bet they dont follow it
welll one day they will see you were right
How old is she now? why do you miss her baby stage?
I see she is probably all rambunctious now.
That is some confidence.
I am envious of you.
Have you been studying? how do you feel about it?
great! I just took all of my finals last week.
That sounds somewhat weird.
Ok I get it now.
what movie? did you survive the night?
OH my god! the ring scaed me half to death when it came out omg. IM scared thinking about it.
I hope they are attractive.
Oh my why on earth did you do that?
As you should be you hurt your girlfriends feelings.
Are you serious? I wish I could do that. Was he apart of a show
Thats awesome I wish I could do that like that impressive.
yes I have and its not fun at all why would you have to break your wifes?
Oh I see why would that break her heart?
She sounds like a sweet woman.
I am so envious of you.
me too haha! now they re all painted as molestors.
Thats right.  the world is so scary now a days.
Thats a bit shocking huh?
Wow I wonder what will happen now
oh my god man was it hot?
imagine having a mean boss and having to wear that all day ha
Hooray celebrate and have fun until you have to start working and it all begins again.
Be happy dude cause your on to a new chapter in your life. But whatever you do make sure you wake up every day wanting to do it.
why is that?? what do they have that you dont have?
Yesh that can be hard to deal with but I believe you will have it all one day too.
Were you nervous and what for?
Oh no how old was he? 
why do you feel that way? what is going on?
never be that way! you are amazing and perfect and awesome!
Good job! You must be so proud of yourself.
Maybe its time to launch your art career full time.
thats honestly amazing keep it up and never go back.
yes i have been fighting my weight my whole life.
That is very mean of them. How did you react?
I hope it wasnt too scary for you and you can laugh it off now.
Oh my god! how have you been bathing?
oh my dont lift up your arms!
That sounds bad. Do you feel lonely now?
I agree I guess they werent a good friend after all 
oh now man thats terrible.  She didnt deserve such an amazing person like you.
thats no good at all! you may feel better after you sleep yeah?
That must be a great feeling huh?
im glad to hear that!
Uh oh well with all of the things you do for him I think he will survive.
LOL I would be slightly upset im not gonna lie.
Does she fulfil every need for you? 
Thats so reassuring to hear that true love is still out there
what happened? how long have you been waiting?
yay! that is amazing! when do you atart?
Yum! Pizza for breakfast? My favorite.
Yes enjoy the weekend lol
Go back to sleep!
I agree just a read a boring book and you will be snoozing in no time
I am sorry to hear that.  Have you tried looking up organizations in your new area to meet people with similar interests?
How about church a fundraising activity or volunteer opportunity to meet new people?
Aw were you too busy to go?
Oh no! I hate when that happens. Are you feeling any better?
Aw thats so nice of you! I bet she appreciated it
Keep doing things like that! Parents appreciate little thoughts like that more than we know
Oh man I would be so mad...did he apologize at all
Yeah sounds like he needs a taste of his own medicine lol
Thats great! I bet you love that
Haha well dogs do that. I highly recommend not letting the puppy lick your face while its young
I hope it wasn
oops.  I hope you apologized to him.  If it was milk I wouldnt cry over it too much.  
Aw I hope your dog is much better trained now
I never took my dog to doggie school and I regretted it. She could have done with some more discipline. 
Thats terrific. Do they speak English there?
Thats a good idea. I hope you have fun!
That stinks did they give you fair notice so you had chance to find a new place?
Im sorry to hear that I hope you can find something quickly.
Why are people so inconsiderate. Are you ok?
Yea its not enough that you drive safe sometimes.
Thats great! I hope she gets it!
Is this for her dream job?
uh oh someone is in trouble.
hahaha a party is a light way to put it.
Oh? Is it a family group or some other meaningful photo?
OH! haha well you learn something new every day. Noodles sounds good though
That sounds awesome. Enjoy your day off!
Oh you got the place all to yourself too?
Oh my goodness. Thats terrible.  Did you take him to the Vet right away?
Do you know whose dog it is?
Wow that is coming up soon.  I be you are excited.  Is this your first child?
That was thoughtful of them.  It is always nice to have a fun surprise!
That would be so annoying!
I dont blame you for that. I would do the same.
You get nervous hu?
Have you been on a date recently?
Thats cool.  Are you a dancer
Cool. Do you like it so far?
Thats terrible. How did they do that?
Did it ever get resolved?
Why you shouldnt have text her?
Nice what did you order
Well better be careful you might end up opening someone elses mail lol
Thats awesome. do you usually exercise in the mornings?
I usually feel better when I exercise but Ive been putting it off.
Thats impressive was it difficult to make?
I guess it probably requires a lot of practice to get the technique down.
Checkups can be nerve wrecking sometimes.
I understand that. There are way too many illnesses that are out of our control.
really? i tortoise? i have one in my backyard too!
he is my pet.. i have had him 10 years.. he is about 70lbs now.. got two more little ones inside 
Oh no. Was there no one to walk home with you?
Thats good. Do you have to walk home like that often?
Good nothing happened.
Oh wow. That must be embarassing!
Guess you dont like her anymore then.
Oh thats cool.  Sounds like hes living the dream lol
Do you have any kids of your own...or is he your main  only furbaby
Nice! How often do you get haircuts?
Your hair must grow really quick!
That is good. I am glad to hear that you are comfortable with life.
I am sure your wife feels that she is the lucky one.
That really stinks. Maybe  you both can take some time off of work and be together?
Well you should sit down with him and have a talk with him about it. 
Thats terrible news. I hope they are in good hands. Are you okay?
I am glad. But I hope you are doing okay! Get out and meet some cool people Easier said than done I know.
heh well at least you can be here while working
maybe next time
ooooh I would be too!  I had someone dent my car too last week.  I feel your pain!
Nope!  Try paintless dent repair. Its not too pricey and quick fix.
Sorry to hear that. Are you taking him to the vet?
I understand. That is life.
Thats really nice of them did they help you move your heavy appliances and stuff too?
Oh either way thats still very generous of them and Id certainly be grateful to have someone like that.
im staying in.. its raining cats and dogs
What type of pet
Oh thats pretty cool...is it full grown or still a baby
I would have been too. Were you at a store parking lot or at work?
That is so awful. I guess they didnt bother to leave a note?
oh dang that stinks
Why? What was going on?
Well Im sure youve both got your own unique skills...what would you say are 3 things you do well?
Thats really awesome! What kind of lyrics do you write?
what do you think is going to happen?
ah well good luck
Why do you need a day off?
Nice. Some leisure time is always good.
Haha well thats to be expected I guess. Do you play the lottery often?
I think its fun to buy one every now and then but wouldnt be my goto for entertaining gambling.
Yum that sounds delicious. Youre making me hungry.
You should just get a half vegetarian. No need to punish your self like that.
yea tell me about it... im still paying off ccs from when my wife and i were dating p
Oh I feel ya.  No kids yet so Im soaking up all the freedom I can hahaha
Thats great. Practice makes perfect.   
Keep at it. Maybe one day you can start selling those drawings for money.
heh .. it was ok but kinda boring in a theater
well at least you saw it then.. some people wont even try
I can understand.  Then are times when I want to get out of work too.
Sometimes it is helpful to take a break and go home early.  It allows you to kind of reset.
thats awesome.. how long did that take
I hope its paid too.
Are you going somewhere for a vacation?
I love fossils!
What do you like about them
Whats going on Monday?
Yeah I guess that will be like a vacation for you.
why would it be wrong?
ah yea it happens
Oh no! Is it serious?
Well I hope that it isnt serious and your dog makes it through
Congradulations.  I assume it comes with a pay raise.
with a window?
Awesome.  Im almost a little jealous
what do you mean? did you get stuck somewhere?
lammee did you atleast finish up the file?
did you throw him out?
did it work?
Thats terrible! Im really sorry to hear that but even if you could have said something it doesnt just make it better.
Is that what happened to her? My mother was like that as well. Its terrible to watch somebody you loved turn into someone else because of an addiction.
That would be annoying. If there is anybody over him you might try reporting it first.
Lol  Maybe you could ask for another department
Man I have recently been getting into shoes I dont have nearly as many as some of my buddies  need to step my game up.
I just like the style I want to show off with ever outfit.
Oh hate when that happens.  How did you know you acted a fool
Youll figure it out.  I believe in you
I hate that. Im glad youre ok!
We all do stupid stuff as kids.  The important thing is you realize how bad that behavior is now.
I understand regret over previous actions but you just got to move forward.
Good for him! The only time Ive ever gotten a hole in one in golf is on a video game. 
Its definitly a really hard thing to do. Your friend must be really lucky!
i can see that
The powerball drawing is tonight 
When did that happen?
I just found one in my toilet the other night!
How bad was it?
Thats really cool that you have those awesome memories. Do you ever go baack and see your family?
Well I hope you have a good time!
Have you always had this fear of the dark
Is there any specific reason why?
have you ever been there before? I hear its great!
Save up and sign up for deal alerts on expedia and other sites. Its really amazing how cheap you can get trips nowadays!
Oh wow where do you get these pets? from a shelter or off the street?
oh wow thats good of you to be able to bring in dogs off the street.
wow thats great is that the one you got off the street?
well i wish you good luck on that one!
Oh my god..I would be too! No locks?
Oh...I have locks on all my gates and the companies have to ask for permission. That is terrible! Did you get your dog back?
Have you tried find a away to keep the seperated?
Im sure that it will get better. Dogs are really smart so if you keep working with her Im sure she will get it. 
Oh my gosh! It sound like she has a had a rough life. You are great for taking care of her!
I am bad with anxiety too but if you havent done anything wrong then all you can do is try to have some self confidence and prepare for the worst and HOPE for the best. You never know you could be getting a raise!
Prepare then and you will feel better either way it goes you will be prepared so if its bad you will already have known and if its not then you will get surprised. Either way it wont rock your world.
Oh man! Well all you can do is prepare early as you just never know! Life isfull of change.
Thats pretty awesome.  What breed
Thats pretty generous of you to adopt an abused dog especially a pregnant one.  Thats a lot of responsibility but I love pitbulls too so I wouldve done the same
Well of course..Like all the drunks and druggies begging for money who wont work on my corner? Most people are poor..and work hard!
Poor people are the hardest workers in america usually..Its corps that have a HUGE pay gap and the CEOs make ridiculous money while the people keeping the companies dont even make a living wage
Oh no. Im sorry 
Pets are great but they sure are tragic.
Thats good that you were prepared! Puppys can be a handful.
Man that does sound like a handful!
I hear you! Tell me about your family?
Why did you move away from home? That is cool to have a brother in highschool. Highschoolers usually arent home much anyhow 
Oh my goodness! That would be so hard!!
You the pitbull guy? haha
Gal  what did you end up naming the pup?
Its rare to have great parents it seems I am glad you have good ones!
I feel the same about my mom! Wonderful! Remember to cherish them daily as we never know what can happen and arent promised tomorrow
Aww I hate to hear that. How long have you two been together?
Well hopefully when its all said and done itll be be worth it. Best of luck with it.
I have never actually had one of those! We dont get very exotic fruits here in the midwest. What do they taste like?
Never had sunflower seeds. I love Pomegranate juice though. Sounds interesting. Do they taste anything like a watermelon or more like a raspberry?
I LOVE watermelon...Geez I could literally sit and eat a whole one by myself. My complexion always looks better after watermelon too
LOL! I know..my sister hates them..but I dont like most veggies  Rapsberrys are a close second!
Why the odds are not in your favor
Ha its never bad to try though
so what was plan B?
oh that sounds good.
When is it due out?
Who is your favorite Marvel hero?
That sounds really great and delicious! 
Ohhhhhh yeah thats no good. Still that happens to me all the time so I wouldnt worry too much about it. 
Does anything awesome ever end up happening?
Thats whats up
who did they leave and where?
Oh no I hate that
Maybe he comes back or you find him
That sounds creepy
I guess ignore it for now
Sounds like a relaxing day.
Is it your day off?
Well that comes in handy.
ah.. take it to the bank to find out
Thats really awesome! What are you going to be doing with your time?
Well thats good! A little rest and relaxation is always good!
Oh no! Where were you coming from?
Yikes! Did you get home okay? Normally I weave different ways when I think that
I am sure tomorrow will be fine
I am sorry I hope tomorrow is different then
Thats great that you were so confident. I wish I could be like that.
Thats great that you have that kind of personal growth
it made him a ton of money so i think thats all that mattered to him at that point cause i agree it was crap.
that was back then when he was trying to do something great the drive isnt there when you have already done it
that was nice of them.
always good to have friends like that
What pet does she have?
Oh wow. Dont think Ive ever seen one of those.
i get that. i am in pain every morning and get up and go to work everyday. so its hard to find sympathy from me
exactly. it really drives me nuts when people feel like they entitled to this or that.
Hmm maybe its not your time yet...Im sure youll get there
I wish you abundant joy success health and wealth in all areas of your life.
Awesome. Thats a whole lotta pizza slices.
Awesome I hope you enjoy it.  Dont get too fat.
I am so sorry to hear that. Who is taking care of your neighbor?
Thats really sad. Not being able to even know whats going on anymore.
I understand! Did you get in trouble?
Good officer for once! That is good to hear!
Oh no! Why was she starved?
Some people should not be in charge of another living being.
Thats true. Whats going on?
Some people are only out for themselves unfortunately.
Oh wow! What does it look like now?
Going to miss who?
thats a nice gift for a cat.
80 wow that is cool.
What is going on Monday?
LOOOOL! They go back in september here. Oh yey relaxing time!
Thats wonderful to hear!
Whats been going on in your life?
Bummer.  You still keep in touch with her or what
Nice.  Give the newbie a chance Im sure shell come around.  What kind of work do you do
That must be frustrating. What are you going to do now?
Im so sorry that happened. What brand is the HD?
Yes. Why did you bought that many popcorn kernels?
Dang that stinks better luck next time.
thats good that you are trying!
Do you know how it happened?
That sucks. I hate people who do stuff like that and dont take responsibility.
That sounds like so much fun  and like a break youre looking forward to yes?
Have you been before? It seems like such a great way to both play and get a workout 
Thats very nice of her!
Your brother is a lucky guy!
I am not sure how anyone could like those things
I do not like them either though
That poor dog
That all sounds horrible
Did they just not care?
Sometimes they are tired at the end of their shift. It happens
what are you saving up for?
wow i wish i could be like you 
Why is he missing and is he home?
Oh god some dogs have to be watched a lot! Watch the shelters and put up flyers everywhere online
Hm thats pretty useful info right there...you must be quite the handymanwoman I wouldve probably just bought another one lol
I know right? I love the side hustle!
No idea what that means but it sounds good! lol
where do you want to go.
oh wow that sounds cool
whats happening next week?
arent we talking about the kids going back to school?
I hope the cat likes it
That is great I am glad you got it
What happened? Was he honest with you?
Ugh! Did he offer an explanation yet?
I think a lot of parents are!
Were they a handful over the summer?
is there anything that can be done to save it
what does she plan to do if she cant?
It happens a lot
Was it a long wait
thats always nice to have time to sit and relax
good for you.
I am sorry any reason why?
Some drunks are funny and some are unfortunately annoying as hell.
Oh man all your friends are the annoying drunks?
You  got lucky.  I dont ever seem to get warnings.
Yeah no kidding. You caught a break.
I am happy that you think your interview was successful.  I know they can be nervewracking sometimes.
I am glad to hear it.  I hope you get the new job!
i bet. that would be a bummer for anyone
i bet. i never play so i cant complain
ah i get that. thats good.
Nice what do you do
Thats pretty awesome keep grinding
Thats great! You are reaching your goals then?
That is very sweet. Family is important
I know that feeling for sure
Ah man! You shouldnt feel bad about tripping. Why do you feel bad about it?
Take it in stride. Humility is a great feature to have!
I get like that was there a particular reason or just dont like it in general?
That can be scary. We live in the middle of nowhere so I really panic when I hear something. I totally understand
that sounds like fun. what amusement park?
that is awesome. hope you enjoy yourself
I dont have a green thumb myself. What plants are you growing?
Wow. Thats quite a variety! Those cantaloupes will be delicious!
Interesting.  You gonna get new ones
What kind were they
Some people dont realize its just as easy as being comfortable being yourself to be accepted.
Are you gonna have to see this person again?
hrmm did it grow legs and walk away?
you probably need to think about setting up a search crew
I think weve all gone through that. How many tickets did you buy?
Thats good. Not much wasted then.
That sounds great. Are you going to go get brunch after?
Thats usually what I do.
Oh wow that is great for her
Its a good thing to be healthy
That is nice do you usually go to church? 
Defenitly sounds like something that you are your brother can share together and bond!
I have heard that a lot today! How did yours get out
Ah! Have you put up flyers etc?
that sounds good.
yea its great when things come together.
Thats awesome are you in the wedding?
Well atleast you will be happy for him and there.
Oh no! Do you forget birthdays a lot? I do sometimes. Always good to set reminds on your google calender etc
Did you get them a late birthday present
Saving money is so important
That is very smart to think about
Yea you definitely need a break every now and then. Is it vacation time?
Sounds like youre really tired. Are you going to make it to the end of the year without a break?
that is so cool. i loved the old school computers
i know right. and the aol and dial up screeching in the background
I am sure you will get it eventually
I hope you do not have to do that
You are a great friend!
Well shes very lucky to have you during this tough time for her.
I can imagine. Luckily mine dont go far when they do
Im sure it was a challenge getting him back home at least you got some exercise haha
Oh no!  Why did it take them so long to get back with you?
Thats horrible!  Did you already have plans made for the trip?  I hope you can work it out with them but if not maybe finding another job that is a bit more accomodating would be beneficial.
Do you mean the biology class was taken at a school?
Wow. That is pretty amazing. Did you enjoy it?
That is nice. Would you be buying your cake there?
I understand. Is it close to your home?
Thats very kind of you. How long has he lost his job?
3 months isnt too bad. I hope he stays strong.
hell get them next time.
People usually dread Mondays. Whats happening that day?
Oh hahaha. A lot of my friends have been tweeting about that.
Cats are very fun sometimes
I am sure its a nice cat too
uh oh did something happen?
What usually happens this tiem of year?
I cant wait for it to cool  down. Its so hot here.
Texas.  It was in the 90s today.
Oh man that kind of thing would make me furious. Do you have any idea who it might have been?
Yeah I hate it. Parents need to start raising their kids better.
Im sure they arent though hahahaha.
I hope the one who doesnt want to return at least gets to spend more time with their friends.
you should probably go to the doctor
well it might help you get rid of them a little quicker or find the underlying issue
Whats your plan?
aw is he usually clingy?
What kind of cake was it
I am glad you deserve a treat every once and awhile
That sounds pretty amazing. Is the place you go to nearby?
Oh thats actually not that bad. How long are you guys going for?
I hope you do not get sick!
I guess you were hungru
Thats pretty awesome Ive never played before! It is hard to learn?
I bet! Good luck I hope you win some good money!
Thats unfortunate made a new one since?
Thats terrible I hope you find someone soon.
so do you wait till you are back at home?
yea thats understandable 
oh no. did you find it?
have you tried the shelters or local vets?
Being alone is good sometimes!
Yep. You should definitely do the things you wouldnt normally do with people around!
Wow thats a strange thing. Any idea why that happened?
Haha must think you guys are the luckiest on the block.
I am glad what grade did you get
Oh wow that is great
That sucks. Have you tried contacting your family?
Well youre talking to me so thats something.
I dont blame you. Work is a drag
im sorry  to hear that
yea this is true
That never sounds fun
I am sorry you had to work then
Aww Im sorry i hope you atleast got some good relaxing time alone!
Thats great! Enjoy the weekend and have a good week!
did you pull over or keep pushing through
well at least you made it safely through!
What grades are they in
Oh wow that is a lot of school
do you think its going to happen?
I hate that. Work is never fun on the weekends
That sounds very painful
Oh I love trying new things for me! Everyone deserves spoiling sometimes
I have that problem too. Most feel heavy and make me sweat. I really hope its just right for you
Great! What kind of job and how good of a promotion?
Oh great! Hopefully a nice chunk of change 
Are you going to get the right part?
I am sure you can find help online
Congrats! What kind of job is it?
Great! What kind of stuff will you be doing?
Its instinctive. They  pretty much know what to do by instinct.
Thats great to hear.  Im glad it worked out.
i dont really follow players when they get so big that they seem like they are getting too big for their britches
i used to live in miami and that was a big deal when he was part of the white hot heat
ah yes its always nice to take a moment to remember the past
thats wonderful to hear! take care.
Why was it without you?
Well that cant be helped. What kind of trip was it?
No not if he is being loud and rude that is never okay
I guess he has no care for anyone but himself
did he get a beat down?
ah well in that case thats a good move.
What kind of pet was it?
Very cool lizards I like their beards.
Oh wow Im sure she will understand! My send some nice flowers and a sorry card.
A mothers love is unconditional she will forgive you 
Just be careful I am sure you know what you are doing
I am glad you go! What kind of church is it?
What are they doing tomorrow?
Why did you have to cancel?
I can understand that  unfortunately some times we have to do those annoying things in order to keep things level.
Were the people involved ok?
Always that bad egg everywhere. Its people like that that causes accidents.
yes i cant wait for it to be over!
yea we have the AC on way too much in the summers
Whats going on next week?
Oh yea how could I forget that. How many kids do you have?
Wow congratulations! Will it be a big ceremony?
Thats smart I think big weddings are a waste of money honestly.
Its good to have friends you can count on like that.
Youre right. Theyre pretty rare.
Yeah its really hot here. I cant wait for it to cool off.
it was in the 90s today
aw thats so sweet. I hope it goes well.
Is it your first date with the person?
sounds like my wife
i set the clocks ahead in the house and in the car .. it doesnt work all the time but it helps 
Nice. How many tickets did ya get?
Good luck! Howd you choose the numbers?
how do you feel like it went?
that would be amazing. when will you know?
They still have not taken notice?
Thats very unfortunate hopefully that changes.
What happened to your dog?
Im sorry to hear that.  are you going to get another doggo?
Wow. Did the roach make it?
Dang. You sure told him!
Congratulations! How did you go about losing so much weight?
Oh I can relate I love food a lot and its a curse and a blessing.
Man that sounds really delicious. Whered you get the recipe?
Your boss sounds pretty amazing. I want to work with you guys hahaha.
Oh wow that must be confusing scary and fustrating!
Exactly! no one is going to take the warnings seriously!
Really? Can you explain that more?
Thats amazing. I really am impressed for your dog.
Aww thats sad. I have been there more than I like to admit.
Im sure if hes a good brother he will understand. My family is always happy to receive food as a gift because its made with love.
wow that is awesome that you were able to do that
everyone needs to get out in the real world to stay sane!
That is sad. What was the gift she wanted?
wow she is asking too much. Every kid want a horse.
Good life partners are hard to find. You hold on to him.
How long have you two been together?
oh really how?
haha that is great
ohh strange. Keep an eye on him.
Yes. Be safe. Call police in emergency.
Oh no what happened next?
Im glad nothing happened.
wow she should be very good?
That is very good.
Thats terrible! You are being nice to try and help her.
Hopefully she can find something else quickly so she doesnt worry so much

I guess hes confident that he can do well with any team.
Thats great! Do you have a traditional job or do you work for yourself?
I know its hard when youre not sure if you can make enough money. Was there a change that made you feel better about it?
O really? howd she react to hearing that?
Im sure something really frustrating happened first.
oh my were they able to take it?
what a fool. where the cops able to catch him?
that stinks. hopefully he wont try it again on you or anyone else for that matter.

I bet its beautiful! Did she wear it often?
Youre so lucky to have that to remember her by

Ah yes I know what you mean. Nowadays we barely have time to just play games.
I hate being a grown up I wish I could go back to the good old days.
Oh wow that sounds pretty terrifying!
Jesus thats a lot. Keep your doors locked and a chainsaw handy. Hopefully hes caught soon.
Are you doing anything special for it?
You could always throw yourself a party. That way you can invite who you want and avoid seeing people you dont want. Haha

You couldnt tie a sweater around your waist?

Yep good lecturers always help when youre learning.
Oh no! Two weeks is a bit long. Works sucks sometimes huh?
Make sure to keep in touch!
Weather can really be fickle.  Did you have a backup plan?
Thats not a bad way to spend your day.  That can be just as fun if you get the right kind of movies.  
Thats still an impressive accomplishment! If they didnt buy it that just means you get to take it down by yourself again!
Oh really? Was it pretty exciting then?
That sounds like fun. I think you definitely got your moneys worth.
Oh no! Is it close to your house?
Well make sure you stay inside and lock your doors and windows and dont answer your door!
Congrats! Thats great!
That is quite an accomplishment and you should be proud!
Are you happy or sad about it? I mean on one hand you have all that time to yourself but at the same time Im sure you miss them.
I know what you mean I feel that way every time my kids go to their grandparents house too.
That sounds like a classic car. Did you used to ride in it with your dad a lot?
Haha thats awesome! Sounds like you had a fun time with it!
Ugh they do that at my apartment too. You should put a can outside with a big sign that says THROW YOUR NASTY BUTTS HERE
I know its like its not that hard to just put them in an ash tray or put it out and throw it in a trash can.
Oh no! Was it damaged?
Thats such a relief! Did it clean up easily?
Did you mean cat?
Well sometimes cats like to roam around. I hope he comes back soon. I love cats
Wow! Congrats! I know you were happy about that!
Did he get you the one you wanted?
That is spo terrible my dpg died when I was really young and just have never really had a dog since

That sounds so fun! I would love to have a pool in my yard.

Thats so rare in teenagers! Sounds like you did a great job raising him.

Im sorry! Im sure something better will come along.
Always be positive 
Thats lame why is work alwasy keeping us from doing what we love.

That sounds so frustrating! I cant stand messy people.
Sounds like it! Are you in a management position or something where you can say something to them?
Sounds like a handful!
Thats exciting! First day of school can be stressful.
Oh no did you research what happened for it to be like that?
I believe you will do better next semester cheer up buddy
Thats great! I dont like being alone all the time really.
Oh thats horrible. Yes you have overcome a lot it sounds like! Your outlook seems great now.
No I did not
Yes I have one credit card 
What color is your favorite dress?

That is sad. Maybe you should put more effort in teaching her yourself
Yeah that will help a lot.  however do not blame yourself very much.It aint entirely your fault
Swimming is really fun and besides it it is very healthy as it involves all muscles of the body to be engaged in movement
Good idea. That way she will learn selfdiscipline and flexibility
Thats great! Did you enjoy it?
Thats awesome. Sounds like you have a great set of friends.
Wow. Well done! How did you do it?
Thats a good spot then
Must be nice planning anything exciting?
Thats fair so long as you destress and have a good day it doesnt matter what you do right?
But you know if you have some time off might be a good chance to do cleaning round the house too.

Thats a good way to be. No point in being envious all the time.
Me too  it would stop so much hate and bitterness.
Same here! I havent picked one up yet but I loved all the choices they made on it. Some true gems on there.
Right! I had only played the leaked beta from back in the day. Thats the one I am most excited about!

Holy heck just like right out of the parking lot or what?
Crap is your insurance going to be able to get you another car or what?
Have you thought about getting a second opinion?
Perhaps you should get different insurance.
thats so sad
All it takes is just a smile and a hello and at least you have one now. Me!
What did she do to fail you?
Did she have the baby?
May be because of the talent they possess!!

I absolutely hate liars.   Are you sure he is really a friend if he lied to you?
Oh I see.   I guess its kinda hard to give a friend you have a long time over a lie they told.   Hopefully heshe had a good reason to tell the lie then.
What is the interview for?
That sounds like a great job.
Wow! When do you go?
Not too long to wait then. Are you going to Tokyo?
Really? What did they do?
Oh no! Did he get let out in the morning?

You can report yourself to the police.
Im not sure everyone agrees. But Im not American so I cant judge it fairly
If you are very sure about it. I know you will!!
Good for you. I hope you will
Were you expecting them to?
Do you expect them to lose now?
Have you ever thought of talking to someone online?
Perhaps you should join Facebook.

Yeah its very sad
What did you receive?
What was in it?
Im looking forward to it too
What kind of donuts?
Did you eat them quickly?
I havent watched it in years. Is it good this time?
That always makes it interesting
Was anyone there or was it just the wind?
At least it wasnt a robber.
Oh really? I didnt know that actually
last time I saw him he was playing pretty rough so its neat to hear hes back on track
That is great I bet it is pretty.
Do you play any instruments?
CAn you not ask him not to?
Could you hide the keys?
Is it for a job?
What kind of job is it for?
You will do fine just relax.
Just remember that it is only one interview. 
No  did you used to text while driving?
But maybe some people arent as consientous as you and did get into accidents
was there something wrong with it?
ah well thats true
Are they going to pay for the repair?
That stinks nothing you can do.
Top scorers in what?
Nice what is your favorite subject?

I love watching soccer .
I love Manchester United.
Really  do you know the bride?
Thats nice. When are they getting married?
ok now deal with it by confessing to her 
oh ok. Just be hopeful that he wont find out
What are you looking to get?
Have you asked you boss?
Aww you must have been close to them.
Thats hard to lose someone so close to you. At least their memory will live on forever with you.
Maybe he wants you to work the weekend.
That would be a smart move.
I do not like pizza.
I just do not like the sauce and too much bread.
Its not fair  but I suppose the opposite view is that if they make enough money then you dont need the support that otehr people do.
What happened? Was it that bad?
I am sure she didnt like that.
Do you think there are any reasons for that?
Who is everyone?
How many grandchildren do you have?
I hope it works out well for you buddy
when do you go?
i wish you good luck!
What did he do to the dog?
Did the dog ever come back?
oh dear. Are you ok?
oh no. sorry to hear about your pig.
What job is it for?
What is the name of the charity?
Did you shave it off or are you naturally bald?
Have you considered a hair transplant?
What did she make?
Nice. I love creamy pasta sauces
I know right? The wage gap is pretty big in many cases.
Thats a good way of looking at it. It really boggles the mind.
I agree. Im sure Lakers fans are thrilled!
I dont think they can... yet. But Im rooting for them anyway.
probably brought back some memories ?
well at least it brought back some good memories!
oh wow that is gross.
yea i dont see why thats allowed on tv how is that not animal cruelty
Was it alright?
Oh no. has he done this before?
Oh man! What did you want to do with it?
I love to fish. Therell be other chances though
did they taste good?
thats all that matters!
lol. Did the child cry when you took it?
That sounds very interesting.
Job interviews always make me nervous. Research is a great idea!
It definitely cant hurt. Good luck on the interview!
Lovely how old is he?
I heard about a baby whos first words were Hey Google
Yeah  along with a  million kids called Alexa.
Wow. What did you do then?
Im glad you got your money back.
Are you going on vacation?
how bad was it
well there is always the next game!
Thats so funny! How did they react when you did that?
I wouldve been so embarrassed if that was me. At least youve got a funny story to tell people.
I feel sorry for you how did you reacted ?
This is normal maybe you should take so time alone to think about how you really fell about the situation. Anger  can make you do things that you will regret later. 
Oh that sound like a lot of fun!! Hope your date ended up being worth all that work.
Confidence is definitely a good things to have when going on a date.   I bet your looked great!
Thats good. Great teachers are always needed in this world.
Oh no! Did you hurt yourself bad?
Ugh! Sounds like a problem. Can you find out who it was.
Well its best not to think about it too much. Being angry will not help at all. 
That is so nice of them!
You have some great people at work!
Oh that can be annoying! I guess in her defence it was a Saturday night? But still it doesnt take much effort to try to keep the noise down even if you do get in late! I hope you were able to sleep okay. 
Yeah like you suggest it is the little considerations of the other persons needs that can make the difference between an okay and a really good flatmate.
That is so sad.
Yeah it will take some for the pain to go away.
Oh no. Im so sorry to hear that. It must have been terrifying?
Im glad youre ok
I hope you did well.  Was it difficult?
What was the test over?
Nice who did may I ask?
I see you must me so proud of him.
That is cool
Awesome! Congratulations to you both! 
I bet. What school is she going to?
Yes I have 3 children
That is so cute! That must make you proud
How did it go? Did you get the job.
Thats so awesome! Was it in the field you wanted?
I bet so.  I cant imagine the difficulty of having to enter a field like that.
Division 1 is pretty prestigious.  That is very cool indeed.
Wow that mustve been awful! How did it all turn out?
That sounds really scary Im so glad it all turned out fine.
It is so nice to have family be able to back you up in a time of need. Have you been able to catch up yet?
That is wonderful! Great wait to start the upcoming holiday season.
Not cool! Why did you do that?
As you should! You should put back the money that you stole.
True I hope you can fight those urges.
That must be so frustrating
Im sorry to hear that. I hope he stops soon.
Oh my how did you deal with it? I hope you didnt kill it.
Good on you. The spider is probably thankful for that. It didnt mean to scare you.
I am so sorry that you couldnt go as I can see this was so important to you.  Why did you have to cancel?  Must have been something important come up!
Im sorry you that happend to you.  DO you write books?
Was your name on it?
Have you had issues with this worker before?
Oh no what did it say?
Oh congratulations!  I am so happy for you!
Were you guys married?
Are you serious? Thats so childish. I wouldnt let it bother you even though I know thats easier said than done.
Good on you for taking that stand! You must be very proud of yourself 
Its all down to hard work. You deserve to be there. 
I dont really follow soccer but it always cool for an underdog to do well.
I do too.  Was it their first time to the final?
That is so cool!
He must be a hard worker!
Do you feel nostalgic about it? If they were good memories.
Yep childhood was the best time. Its best to remember these things every now and then.
Oh no Im sorry to hear that. 
I would have done the same thing. Some people have no respect.
Yep those are the most exciting times of life. 
It must have been the best feeling in the world. I am glad you felt it too.
Thats great. Is it very nice? Ive never been in one of those before. 
How many people does it hold? I have five kids so we have a minivan. 
She must have a lovely voice!
Did you have your alarm on
Oh wow I would have thought maybe an animal had gotten in
Yes one time. I was feeling very hopeful that day. Have you?
Oh my sorry to hear that. I am sure there is another job out there for you.
How long were you deployed for. And thank you for your service.
In the medical clinic I bet quiet nights were ok.
Oh my goodness Im sorry! I have a dog and two cats.
That says a lot about your spouse when losing your pet is worse. 
Cool!  Getting a new phone is like Christma!
That is a pretty good girlfriend to buy you a new phone.
Oh thats nice of them!  I hope you had a good time at the party!
Ooo wine a classy bunch of folk you are!
I seem you must be quite proud of her for writing on such a subject.
I agree high quality work deserves to be read by a broader audience. 
I sure hope so. Why do you think that it will be a good day?
Yep it sounds like you are starting your day off on the right foot.  Hope mine goes as well as yours seems to be going so far.
You must have been so impressed. They must have been quite talented.
I wish I could dance like that! Too bad I am only good with computers!
Oh that sounds awful! What did you do?
At least once its over its over. I would consider other airlines next time! I would also write a complaint letter. 
Are you good at doing flatpack DIY?
That must have been exciting. 
I have. Its definitely awful. Its much like losing a family member.
Oh no! What a horrible thing to happen. Im sorry to hear that.
Wow what a good moment you had. What did you take as your meal?
Hahaha hahaha u can see that you like good things. I missed that with you.
Are you excited about something?
You must be very hungry
Why would you do that?
Oh wow Have you ever thought about getting help?
Yes and it was the worst experience of my life. Have you?
Oh my I hope you dont feel scared living alone
Oh what is the race? Sounds like a lot of work!
Im sure all the work will be worth it in the end!
Cool! What style of music? 
Ah Ive heard of them they used to be played on some of the local rock stations. Love a tour tshirt always means you might make a friend if you wear it out as other fans are bound to compliment you!
Ha. Was it geice?
How much did you save?
Yes it is terrifying!
Oh thank goodness it was nothing serious.
Thats frustrating. How on earth do you ever get something done?
It would make sense. If you two are doing the same work job its only fair that you evenly divide the housework as well.
Yes its like that all the time for me. 
That is great. I stress myself out over things and I think by doing that it makes things worse.
That is very true. Congratulations on passing your test.
Oh goodness. Why did you do such a thing?
Maybe next time ask her. I hope you pay her back when you can.
Excatly! I would love to know what they spend it all on
Yup they cheat the system and then get a huge refund back
That is terrible. Are you going to take of her?
Why not asking her to move to your home?
Wow that sounds intense. What were some of the features it had?
That does sound scary! I hope you at least enjoyed it a little! 
Yes cruises are awesome. I am sure you will enjoy it.
Nice hopefully you many good writers and keep in touch with them!
you must be excited! 
Nice. Im sure you will have lots of fun doing it.
Do you still talk to the people you went with.
Where did you guys hike? Did you stay over night
Yeah I guess that happens every once in a while.  Something you went through recently?
Oh thats too bad.  Im assuming you didnt win?
Not particularly. I wasnt my best self at that time. I suppose who really is though.
At least you had a good experience. I definitely feel you on the responsibilities part!
You must be really excited for it.
I agree there are great ways to buy unique things 
That was nice of them to chip in. It must have felt good that you had someone to help. 
Thats wonderful. It makes all the difference to have people you can trust especially when you are not feeling well. 
That is nice. Do you like fishing?
I am not a big fan but I go fishing once or twice a year.
Thats great. How big is the bonus going to be?
That would help me out quite a bit too!
oh no! Is everything ok? I hope he didnt scare you
Im sure your very worried. Please get help and call the police. I know it can be nervewrecking.
That sounds so good and the perfect way to spend a Sunday.
Are you going to a restaurant or making it yourself?
Yes I loved him. Have you?
It must have been very devastating. But remember him for all the good times.
DId you get tickets? Or getting ready for your licease?
Thats awesome! Good luck Im sure you will do great.
Hopefully it brought back good ones. Were you close to them?
Its good you have those great memories though!
No do you have one really sick pet?
Did you toke her to a vet?
Are you serious? Why wouldnt you pay him back.
Oh wow I would have called the police.
Did he do something bad?
Its a tough situation. Did you call him after?
That must have been quite the surprise. 
That is so crazy!
That sounds like a smelly situation.
I hope you get that cleaned up.
Was he a competition eater?
Thats pretty impressive.  I dont think I could manage that.
Oh man! you must be sad. have you been bad lately?
I can see how your frustrated. Maybe you can talk to your dad about it. 
A workout program?
Im a division 1 strength coach.
Its good to feel good about yourself
Its a very confident attitude
No unfortunately. Have you?
I agree but I also enjoy my independence. 
Football soccer or American football
Do you play on a professional team?
Oh no! Hopefully youre able to get it all fixed up so you can use it again.
Thats quite a bummer!
You must be excited. packing can be hectic. thank god you are organized. 
I agree. You should double check everything to make sure its there. It will help with the worry and anxiousness about it. 
And what was this thing?
I see you must be very prepared and talented to compete in such a thing.
Oh wow! Congrats I know the process my husband did one. What is your on?
Yes! What univerisyt it it form
Im sorry to hear that. Is it a total loss?
Are you going to replace it with a similar yearmodel?
Oh my why cant they just set a time and commit to it?
I agree you should talk to your friend to be more committed to the plans.
Well that sucks but at least it seems like you have a decent support system?
Yeah make sure he knows that!
Did everything went as planned?
I understand. Did you planned it another time?
Wow thats amazing. You must be excited and full of joy!
I can agree how you can feel amazed about. Maybe I will get one so I can be amused just like you. 
Thats awful. Its a shame that theres still racist people in 2018!
I would have done the same thing.
Yes I litke that too. Do you do that frequently?
That is awful! You should file a complaint!
I would see if you can escalate it. Talk to the corporate level. 
That sucks. I hope you wont be out of transportation
I bet! Theyre really cool cars with personality
Oh those definitely sound like some good memories! At least you have some pictures.
Im sure they would enjoy that quite a bit. They can make memories just like you did.
I do like them but I havent been on that many unfortunately.
Oh no are you alright?
Well just never go back to that bar and make all new friends!
Glad to hear youre feeling better again.  How did you hurt it?
That sucks.  Maybe you need to be a bit more careful until its fully healed.
I feel for youbut dont take it the hard wayits well
Thats what you should do
I am sorry you have had back luck. There are some honest people out there. 
I know it is true. You just have to try to focus on the good I suppose. 
That is a really exciting time. You must be so proud.
I know its hard when they first go off for college but it sounds like you raised her well.
Oh thats amazing! Is it a novel? 
How long did it take to write? I always admire the stamina of people who can write a book. 
Oh Im sorry. I hope you werent hurt!
Thats okay. It happens to everyone! 
I know its a blow but youre only human. Everybody makes mistakes sometimes.
Im sorry. People can be greedy and unempathetic.
Im very happy for you thank God you could get a job thats good!
I imagine it was very complicated for you when you did not have a job that happened to me once and I felt very distressed.
That is nice. How many brothers and sisters do you have?
Sounds like a real example of learning from the past. sorry you had to go through that. are you better now?
Sounds like youre in a good place. Congratulations!
Thats so funny I was just looking at the racing schedule yesterday! I love races if you are talking about horse races. And good memories are the best. 
Did they used to take you? They can be so exciting. 
Thats great! That is wonderful luck!
That is wonderful. I hope you have a great time!
So you definitely believe in the old adage fail to prepare and you prepare to fail?
That sounds like a very sensible philosophy. 
That is so nice of them! What did they bring you?
It sounds delicious! What a good friend. 
That sounds like fun. Did you see any lions?
What else do you see besides lioins?
Oh my! You must have been terrified about it! Did you get it fixed?
Im sure it was very scary for you. Your such a brave person with alot of courage to do so. 
Wow! That is a very expensive car! Did they win the lottery or something?
Yeah. Must be a smooth ride. Lucky guy!
Thats not good.  Cant you withhold if they refuse to fix the leak?  I would be really mad! 
That is true about the waste.  I would sue for compensation.  I think the law is on your side regarding this issue.
That is great.  That is a big worry off your shoulders Im sure.  
I am glad to hear it.  It is a lot more productive to focus on the future than the past.
That is great. They noticed you because you are doing a good job
Good luck with that.
who felt left out? Im confued?
Thats unfortunate what did she end up doing?
What did u do with it afterwards?
Okthats a lot better
Oh thats not fun! I hope it cleared when you took it out! 
It should have cleared it. I once left bread for two weeks when I went home for winter vacation.
Thats so cool!  You must be proud.  Im terrible at hula hooping
It takes a lot more skill than it appears to!
Wow congratulations! Are you nervous?
Awesome! I hope it goes smoothly and that everything works out great for you!
Thats not right! You could probably complain anonymously to the city. 
No. Theres definitely something wrong if they wont call a pest control company.
That is nice. How many childrens do you have now?
That is great. Good job.
That sounds frustrating especially if they are inconsiderate and drain you of your funds. They sound kind of entitled.
Oh wow that must be embarrassing to deal with. Sounds like they are going through a financial situation but they should at least talk to you about it since you two are friends.
Thats great! I hope you have lots of fun and dont get too bitten by mosquitoes
Dont forget marshmallows!
Wow.  That was uncalled for.  I am sorry to hear about that.  Sounds like she is not someone you would want to date anyway
Do not let it get you down.  There are plenty of people out there who are jerks.
That is terrible. How much did it cost you to fix it?
I understand. Does the grocery store have outside some camera?
Oh NO! It can be annoying especially early mornings at work with no coffee. Hope you stay away!
Sounds frusterating. I hope your next one is more dependable. 
Thats not good! Im assuming they got it back on for you?
I bet it was! Thats pretty quick for them to get the power back on actually. In my city it would take a full day.
I be you cant wait! Seeing exotic animals is so exciting!
This will be fun! I bet your full of joy right now!
Im excited for you! Enjoy your day!
That is so scary! Did they catch him?
Im pleased to hear that the security guard sounds brave. Still it must have been very stressful!
That sounds awful! Did they fix the order?
I dont think I would ever order from that place again!
Yikes I wouldve been freaking out.  How did you handle it?
haha I would have run too!
Thats so nice... almost a decade!
Very happy for you! To many more!
Awesome first date! Hopefully it goes well for you.
Whats your favorite exhibit at the zoo?
Oh my.  I bet you were a nervous wreck.  How did you find your cat?
I am glad he is back home and safe again.  You must be relieved.  
Thats awful! Especially in the middle of summer!
Were you able to afford it?
I wish I can win like you I have never won anything before
You have to give your spot to someone else? What do you mean exactly?
Thats unfortunate but an emergency is an emergency.
That is great!  Are you nervous about whether or not you will get into med school?
Thats good to know!  I would be super excited if I were you!
Thats frustrating!  We have cat scratching posts EVERYWHERE to try to avoid that but still had to put the sticky tape on the couch to prevent scratching
Cats are always getting into things they shouldnt but I still love them
What did you do there?
That sounds like a lot of fun! I have never been there
Awesome I love breakfast! What did you have?
Ah such a classic breakfast! You cant really go wrong with that.
You must be proud.  Did her team win the game?
Impressive.   Is she looking forward to her next game? 
That is the worst!  Did you have somewhere you needed to be?
That stinks!  Hopefully you are not to mad because of it.  Flat tires happen to the best of us!
Thats awesome! Its always good to catch up with an old buddy.
Hopefully he hasnt changed too much and you guys still have similar interests!
That sounds wonderful! Im sure you
I am sure you will get there I meant to say. Dont rush or settle and I am sure you will find something perfect. We bought our first house on Friday!
Great! What was it about?
Oh how cool! Did you go alone or with your family?
Oh no! I am sorry to hear that. 
Oh dear. Well next time you are at the store get two cartons!
its always good to be prepared. I live in an area that gets hurricanes too.  Ive even got a generator. 
Last hurricane I was without power for a whole month. It was miserable. 
Oh no! I have had that happen too! It was very embarrassing!
Yes! Did you notice after a short time?
Oh Im sorry you had that experience. When I was traveling crosscountry I used to FaceTime or Skype friends and family. Would that work for you?
Thats very true. Another thing I did was find a Trader Joes or some sort of store and stock up on decent food. Eating alones no fun but at least youre safe and nourished!
I would be so scared to sky dive! How nervous were you before the jump?
Im glad you didnt pass out! I dont know if I would be able to go through with it.
Congratulations on that. What are her plans now?
I hope she would find one as it seems now the economy is really competitive
Thats very sad.  Are you planning on going to syria to help them?
It could end today if everyone came to an agreement.
You must have prepared yourself for this! You will do great!
Great preparation indeed! 
That must have been scary! How are you feeling?
I wouldnt want to be either that sounds terrifying!
That is great.  Was it a scratcher ticket?
I bet.  That was a great surprise I am sure.  Enjoy your vacation!
How frusterating! Have you brought it up to management
I can tell the frusteration in your tone. I would go above your supervisor since nothing has been done. Otherwise you will stay frustrated and angry. 
Wow! I dont know what else you can do. Your at a dead end right now. How annoying!
I know how you feel. I would be furuious. 
I do too! Im always worried Im going to throw up!
I hate when parents dont keep tabs on their kids especially when they are misbehaving!  What did you do?
At least you did the right thing and didnt yell at the kid yourself.
I wish you the best of luck! 
There are many types of loans out there so hopefully you get one! It will also help you build your credit. 
I bet your anxious to know what happens
Wow! I bet you were so happy for her. I can tell by the joy in your words
Who says unreal things? 
Yes that happens but Im not really understanding the context of your comment...
Relaxation is very needful
Yesits well deservedvery wrlcomed
Yeah its very nervwrecking. Im anxious as well to know how it turns out. 
Yeah makes me nervous to know what and how it will turn out. Hopefully everything will turn out good for the best. 
That must have taken some preparation! How did you feel afterwards?
I wouldnt be able to move the next day! I hope you rewarded yourself after all of that hard work!
An ID for glue? Whats next showing ID for buying a greeting card? Sheesh.
I can see that. I guess this is why we cant have nice things.
Know the feeling. I had one job where I spent all day either playing cards or working online just to relieve the boredom!
Is there any way you can do something else during down time or do you have to be available immediately if it gets busy?
Im sorry. What type of job do you do?
Me too. My phone was a help to play online games if I was totally losing it! And sneaking out for a walk helped too!
WHOA! Thats awesome! Ive never won anything in my life lol
I bet! What did you do with all the money?
Oh no!  Did you ever find him again?
I am sorry to hear that.  Maybe he will find his way back home some day.
Why did you lose contact? What happened?
Thats very sad Im sorry to hear that
So where did you sped the time alone?
That sounds like fun Who are you going with?
I am sure you will enjoy it. 
Oh that sounds like fun! What types of food do you cook?
Food always makes the party! 
Wow! How content you must feel about it!
That must have made you feel happy! I can tell!
Im so sorry to hear that. Losing family can be and is very tough.
Thats all you really can do. I hope you find that you heal in time.
The irony that the internet bill could not be paid online is kind of funny.  But I can see how that would be a let down and inconvenient.
That is good.  I like to pay most of my bills online too
Whew youre braver than I am.
I hope it all goes okay for you. Trust your instincts about doing it or not.
Really what happened?
Wow I bet that was pretty interesting to look through and remember those days gone by.  I hope the reminiscing was all good memories.
Im sure that is definitely not true. What makes you think that?
Those type of people are really difficult to deal with. I hope he is open to change.
Being anxious is normal! Be yourself and you will be just fine!
You will be fine! Dont overthink. Just make it a happy day. 
Im sorry to hear that! Are they trying to shame or embarrass you about something. 
You seem like a trusting guy. there are not too many of those these days
Were you embarrassed or what happend?
I know! It can be sentimental at times! You will grow along with them. Enjoy the ride
he didnt punish you... he punished himself! That makes no sense 
Thats great. What do you have going on?
Well thats good to hear!
Oh no thats terrible! Im sorry you had to go through that. Pets are our family.
Im sorry. I hope memories of your dog bring you comfort.
Do you like it ?
Well if you dont you wont be the only one.
Oh no thats bad. Did she take any medicine?
Hmm maybe try some propolis. That works for me and I have horrible allergies.
Really? That was cool
That is kind of them
Thats so goodam happy for you
Waoyou are so favouredare u back already?
Did you feel bad about it?
Sometimes we do things that we dont regret at the moment but do later on down the road.
Oh no  what happened?
Weve lost several with our girls over the  years.  I understand.
Hopefully you do good on those and the doctor clears you.
You will be okay and get better.
What was a snake doing there?
I dont like snakes either 
what? why would she say that? thats mean
like what? you think she wanna do something bad to you or your brother?
You dont like reading alone? 
Yes I can understand that. Im sorry you dont have anyone to read with. Hopefully that will change in the near future.
Oh Im sorry to hear that you seem upset about it.
Oh wow I misunderstood what cheating meant in this context. You can always bounce back and redeem your diet.
There will surely be maggots on that when you get home.
Ill never go to your house in that shape.
I agree!  Especially the green ones.
My husband always says alcohol makes them acceptable.  lol
I would have cried for hours.
I hate spiders and frogs and snakes.
I love pizza!  What is you favorite type?
Why do you say that?  It cant be that bad for you right?
I try to eat the most junk food possible.
I think i will most likely die before i am thirty.
Oh no that is terrible. Ive had that happen once. Did you find him?
Im so sorry to hear that. I know pets are just like family.
Did the vet fix the dog?
My dog is also like family to me so i understand.
Thats funny! I agree and its worse when they arent your kids.
To each their own. I have 3 and to be honest Im glad they are getting older. Babies suck.
I would have had a great time eating your food.
I do not eat chicken but i would have loved the brisket!
I agree that was a really scary one! I think it was much creepier than average horror movies.
How long did it take you to not be scared around your own apartment anymore?
Wow it really stuck with you a long time.
Sounds like a good night. What movie was it?
Thats a perfect way to end the day.
That happens more often that you might think. Just because its expensive doesnt mean its any good.
Yep probably would have been happier at some hometown diner.
Oh yeah I hate that too. Its so inconvenient to be closed when people have time to go there.
I agree. Its about time society caught up.
Im glad youre ok! Its Sunday Im ok too!
Totally. Im not working today. How about you?
yea have fun
ok you have a greate time enjoy
Indeed. Are you religious then?
I was raised in a presbyterian church in Scotland but havent been to church in a while. Perhaps I should go. Which church do you attend?
i bet! I wanna go on vacation too! its been a while. where are you guys going?
Ive been to florida once. I went to universal and adventure island parks. so much fun! I hope you guys enjoy your time there
Wow  can you ask them to tone it down at all?  That would drive me crazy!
That is just crazy they should not disrupt the complex like that.
thats good to have friends you can count on! what kind of party are you having?
nice! Happy belated birthday  I hope you had a wonderful time with your friends
That always makes it a great night when your team wins!
You should have placed a bet since you were so confident. You could have won a bundle.
It is always good to have a friend who can take your hand in times of need. I wish I had more of that type of friends
Will you also have his back?
I need to start saving more money honestly.
I like to spend money on food alot.
Ugh I absolutely hate it when that happens!  
Its so frustrating!  My dog is elderly so its been happening more.
That must be very painful for both him and you.
That sounds better than I had thought.
That is not good.  Why do you think it wont come?
That is true.  I have lost packages in the past.
I wish i could afford a vacation like that.
One day ill try one of those.
Yes he will. 
Hes a beautiful reason to get up
Is she still with you?
She will always be with you.
Maybe they just have better taste?
You can get good looks for cheap! Look at second hand clothes Ive bought lots of designer stuff used.
I would have cried right there.
I can barely walk much less imagine that.
So what do you have for example ?
Oh that must be pleasant to remember the good days with.
why is that exactly?
I try to forget about how bad it really all is.
Okhow do u combine it?
Waothats goodit s so refreshing
I am very confused i hope one day they will.
Keep talking to them and they will make sure you go first.
That must be very hard for you all but Im sure it will be worth it in the end. Whats the exam for?
Thats fantastic news! Congratulations to all of you  him for working so hard and passing and you for being so patient and understanding.
Good for you. Is it truly your first time flying on a plane?
One advice. Dont freak out when the plane go through some turbulence. It is normal and will only last for couple of minutes
Ouch!  That is not good!  Think of the bright side though.  Better opportunities may present themselves to you!
Dont think that way!  There is always something to look forward to!
Was your dog ok? I hope it didnt run away.
That is awful and I bet your husband feels really bad. I would be really mad though.
you mean you stole it or they gave it to you?
thats not good! Thats stealing. if you needed money you shouldve just asked them for it. You need to tell them what you did
I would have screamed.
You should have checked the entire house!
Wow what a show off. Would you say they are nicer by a large margin?
Okay I see your point I think they make really eye catching shoes.
Im really sorry for your loss. At least they still live on through your memories.
Thats really awesome. they sound like amazing people. 
 i dont think i know who Rodney Dangerfield is but hey good for you! its awesome when people have a good sense of humor
I need to google him. Ive never even heard that phrase lol
Thats cool. Do you have a photo album you keep them in?
Oh ok thats a good idea.
The gym always hurts my body when i go.
I hate that feeling so much.
Well its time for a wash then.
Come on you can do it.
Summer flys by i hope winter lasts a long time.
The winter is where i spread my wings and grow.
Seems like you were well prepared did you pass?
Thats a very complicated way to say November.
DId you get out and kick them?
I have bad road rage.
i am looking forward to trying to get pregnant by the end of the year
really? we have been trying for 6 years so its been difficult
I do not think that I want kids.
well i am sure many people do not want to have kids.
im sorry. i know how that feels.
your previous conversation. no worries. I love Disney havent been in 10 years but i love it
How come what do you mean?
Confusion runs deep in me.
Thats really great for you! Some people say that praying helps solve anything
Thats very true!
Ill always talk to you.
Ill always be for you.
Do you still have the cat?
Thats great to hear! Im glad you kept him around!
i hate when that happens! I stub my toes all the time im surprised i didnt break none of them yet
good thing is they heal pretty fast and you dont need a cast or anything like that
I wish you the best of luck study hard and youll do well!
I remember Calc II it can be difficult but if you practice its not so bad.
Good for you. What class was it?
I am not really good at chemical science and had much difficulties during high school. Enjoy your moment. You deserved it
that sounds amazing. i havent seen my family in almost 2 years
i do but they wont come visit and i cant afford to go visit
Im sorry to hear that. Why dont you join some groups so you can meet some new people. 
Sometimes you just have to reach out to people. Oftentimes other people are feeling the same way and you dont even realize it. 
What happened to cause the change.
Oh okay. Take good care of him and hell always love you.
That is great Im sure youve worked very hard for it.
Im so glad they are recognizing you for all your efforts.  It feels so nice to be commended for a job well done.
Heck yeah! I loved that game on the n64 we used to play it all the time in college!
Ill be sure to check this out! My brother has a switch I can borrow!
That sounds like a lot of fun will you be cooking stuff too?
Sounds like a wonderful daylong event hope you enjoy it!
That sounds like a wonderful time. I wish I had the time for that!
Thats very true. 
I would feel guilty too if I was in your shoes.  Did you feel bad because you stole or bad because you got caught?
Then why did you do it?
That is a great attitude to have and wonderful that you are so supportive of them.
Some people get jealous when other people are doing well so you are truely a good friend
Thats awesome! I can say that its agreat feeling to graduate. 
Yeah but now you can go out and make your mark in the real world. 
I bet I get home sickness even if Im gone a couple day.  I bet they are happy to see you as well!
Hope you guys celebrate and eat something good for dinner tonight!
Thats awesome does she live far away or just super busy all the time?
Are you going to dinner together or something? 
Oh? And hopefully they did not!
Yeah I can see that! Not much you can do though to prevent it. Except for living as healthy as possible!
Wow how exciting. Are you going to go?
You can get the pills the patch or that bracelet to help.
That is great! What game did you play? Was it fun?
What do you do in that game?
That is nice.  Was the quilt passed down to you from her?
That is great to keep things that remind us of our loved ones
I know that nostalgic feeling. Time really flies.
Absolutely that makes me want to go look at some pictures.
Oh that sounds disgusting. Have you talked to him about it?
Oh no! I would be trying to find another place if I were you or tell him to find one!
That must be stressful! 
Well if you study hard Im sure you will do fine. 
I can understand. Ultimately you dont have to be rich to have a kid though
True. Well whatever you decide to do I wish you the best!
That is very irresponsible from your side. It is never wise to spend your hard earned money on such leisure
That is the illusion of winning when in reality you are expected to lose
I love physics!
No that is normal.
I didnt go to the gym forever! I know how you feel though
i know. I had an anxiety when i first started coming to the gym. I didnt know how to use a couple of machines so i stayed on tradmill the whole time
Oh no when did this happen? Do you think youll find him?
Thats sad Im sorry to hear that!
My family was over all weekend and we had a blast.
My family is my whole world.
Hopefully you dont have to go through anything like that again.
Thats terrible of them! I would sit with you!
Hey that really stinks. I hope that you can find someone to sit with you.
What was in there?!
Thats hilarious! They sure do! My kids look forward to them!
Thats Awesome. Did you change anything lately?
Oh that is awesome. What motivates you?
OH no! Can you return it?
Yeah  sometimes stuff looks way better on the model.
Its always nice to look back on old memories
Childhood was a lot easier
I agree mothers are great. I appreciate mine as well.
They make so many sacrifices for us. I love to spoil mine on Mothers Day.
Hmmm yeah I maybe would consider moving out. 
Maybe you should have someone go down with you. Safety in numbers?
I am so sorry to hear that. I know what that is like unfortunately.
Yes definitely. My thoughts are with you I hope he still has many years left.
Oh I love to read as well.  Especially during a rain next to a window.
It can! The quiet can be so calming
When did you feel prepared?
What were you prepared for?
ohh its very seek
its very critical situvation
wow this sounds like a crazy situation.
wow well Im glad this all seemed to work out for you!
thats cool dont need a diaper rash
thats usually what happens lol. 
Awesome! What was the name of the book?
Didnt they make a movie from that book?
You mean new house? Did you find it for sale really cheap?
Hmm perhaps it means something really bad happened there. I would give the Ghostbusters a call.
That is very true! I donot understand why people doe that!
Yeah they deserve it!
Awesome! Are you going alone?
Thats great! Is it for vacation?
Im not familiar with the hot light term what does that mean exactly?
Oh thats a neat feature Im sure they taste better when theyre fresh.
Its great to be able to have that trust and bond. Did everything go well?
Thats good to hear all well that ends well.
On no! Did you ever tell her?
Do you think she will ever give you a second chance? 
That is so sad. I hope it wasnt too hard for him.
Losing a pet is tough for everyone. I completely understand the grief.
Aww man yeah we get really attached to our pets huh?
Im sure she is.  All the fish flakes she can eat.
That is horrible.  What is the treatment for it?
I wish your cat the best.  I know it must be hard
Oh cool is it for work or fun?
You sound really well prepared!
How badly did you slip up? Youre allowed cheat days
Thats quite a big slip up... Im not even sure how youd do that.
Yeah I like looking at my old pictures too!
Yeah it is good to think about the good ol days!
Wow you must be euphoric!
How lucky!  Dont get crazy though.  invest form the future.
Thats crazy. Where did it come from?
Strange the receptionist did that. I bet everyone wanted to pet the puppy!
Thats exciting. When is it?
Christmas day huh? What made you decide that?
dont understand youwere you chased by a hurricane?
ok so what was the time frame of evacuation?
That is annoying!  Is someone in your house not doing there job cleaning after themselves.
That is no good.  What are you going to do about it?
How nice of them. My oldest is paying her own way. I wish I was in a situation that I could help her more.
Im sure it was a huge relief not having to worry about loans. Im still dealing with mine and I graduated in 2008.
oh my goodness that is horrible!
I am sure it does.  I am really sorry about all of that.
This happened to us last spring. Our dog was 8 years old. It can be a very emotional time but it gets better over time. Have you thought about creating a memorial for him? Maybe a photo collage to hang.
I know how you feel. Just know that it gets better and try to think about the great life he had because of you and your love!
that is great are you on a business journey or Holiday 
i will be staying at home 
That sounds very lonely and sad.
We watch the twilight zone too on new years. What is bomb food ?
I see. I usually reflect a lot on new years thinking of the past and looking to the future.
nice  just relaxing after a long week that sounds perfect honestly
right it would be awesome to have 3 days off but this is the real world 
you need not to be afraid as long as youve prepared very well
yes i believe you are
That is great news! Im sure you are excited! Congratulations to you two!
I bet you two will have a long and great marriage!
You make it out of wood or is it one of those aluminum ones?
Good for you.  Theres nothing quite like the sense of pride assocaited with building something!
Ah Im sorry to hear that is it for work or something else?
That does suck well maybe you guys can work something out to see each other every so often.
I hope so is your car in bad shape?
Just a month? Not that long to wait but better be careful in the meantime so you wont be left somewhere far from help.
Wow heard that is a tough test good luck and Im sure you are prepared.
Good luck and a future congratulations on killing it!
Thats awful. Wheres she staying now ?
Im glad shes got you to look after her.
That sounds so relaxing!
I hope you enjoy it!
Thats awesome reading is my favorite past time as well.  What book?
Oh Ive read that That is a really good book I even enjoyed the movie as well.
Maybe you should talk with him about how you feel?
Well at least you can say you tried. Sometimes teenagers need to figure it out on their own.
That is so so sad. Are they going to separate or is there a chance that he can change his ways and earn her trust again?
It is very difficult but Ive see marriages recover from that position  but it takes years to build up that trust again properly. I wish them all the best
Oh gross you should bail quick if you see a kid getting sick so that you wont be around to help clean it up.
Im sorry maybe a nose plug would come in handy
as a matter of fact my friend asked me help him move recently  but i was busy at work too he understood 
we cant win them all  but work always comes first 
Howd it taste? And what kind of cake was it?
Well look at the bright side  you got a cake for the anniversary of you becoming a parent to your daughter and your daughter still gets cake.  I kinda think everyone wins there!
That sounds really great! What movie are you going to see?
It really is! I hope that you have a good time!
Thats pretty scummy has he always been like that?
You should have a talk with him and let him know how you feel.
No way! thats gross
I hope they at least fixed it for you!
That sounds so fun!
That is great! Im sure they will enjoy it like you did!
Very good. You must be handy around the house  Im useless! Lanais are wonderful  and necessary in many places!
Smart move. Wish I could do stuff like that. You should be very proud of yourself 
I think you should take the rest of the day of and relax in your new lanai. You can sit and bask in the glory of a job well done!
Thats awesome are you having it ?
Uh oh. What happened?
That was a sweet surprise. Is everything okay now?
Dont think that well! As long as you are prepared you will do great!
Ah yeah I struggled with that too but if you try hard enough you will get through it.
That sounds like a lot of fun. Do you live in the country?
Awesome you will have a blast. Make sure to stay safe.
That is adorable! I bet you were proud!
Awww! Thats great!
Oh no I hope shes ok!?
Lol pour water on it next time. Always does the trick!
Im not suprised. I always did that as a kid.
Yeah the only way he will learn is if he figures it out by himself. 
Awww thats sweet! He was lucky to find such a great partner!
Oh no! You cant do that to your friend! Youll find the right single person in time!
The perfect person for you will come soon enough
Yum! What type of food was it?
I love burgers! Youre making me hungry!
I would be upset too. You need to sit down and talk to him about it
youre a good parent. Keep up a good work
Please call the policeits called noise abuse
Thats what you have to put up with with the wrong neighbors
Aw cant fit any classes into your schedule?
Oh congratulations you must be smart!
Aw Thats awesome.  The training paid off and I bet she feels really proud!
Haha I bet when she becomes a pro you can say youve been her fan since day one!
I hope you got a warranty on it. New cars should not have issues for a while.
Well perhaps you got a lemon. I would ask for a new car if it happens again.
Oh no! I hope that you are getting better!
Thats awesome that you have such a great partner! 
Isnt it fun to think of times like that. When you were free of most responsibilites?
What year did you graduate?
That is great that they are willing and able to help.
I bet that was such a relief for you guys!
Oh wow I bet you were really proud?
Im sure he will! Best of luck to him!
Thats the worst when they take forever.. Have you called them up?
Yeah I understand they should at least give you a discount!
I feel jealous I didnt get the artistic genes my brother got lol
Probably! Makes me feel better now lol
Thats really awesome! You are a really lucky person!
Thats so awesome. I wish my godmother did that!
That is awesome. I am sure she will do great.
And think one day she may be able to save your life haha.
Oh i can relate that happened to me with UberEats a couple days ago. Its so frustrating!
Yeah its the worst when they dont own up to it makes me want to use the competitors service just to spite them. Very annoying.
Oh no! At least you noticed now
Yes and also explain to them you noticed you were doing it. Theyll understand
How many slices did you ate?
Thats a lot for anyone lol
Ive done this before! It can be very nostalgic to see old friends that you havent seen in awhile. Did it bring back any particular memories?
You could always make a collage with your favorite pictures! 
I sort of have. I worked like crazy to get a work visa for the US so I could be with the person I wanted to spend my life with. It paid off so I can kind of understand what youre saying.
Scotland. Its quite a process getting in here despite what some people try to tell you! What happened with you?
Well stay focused and work hard! You got this!
Maybe you could get out and meet some new people.
Yeah arcades are pretty sweet. I like that some of them have bars in them now. 
Im not surprised. It also helps me play better!
Congratulations and Im sure you will do fine.  Do you think you will enjoy doing it?
Itll be a good experience at the very least good luck!
that is sad. why would he gossip! thats so low
That could be so hard on you
Just keep your mind occupied with other important stuff
Congrats! Is this your first child?
I think you will do fine! You will be in love at first sight for your!
Congratulations she must be a quick one I was always the slow one at the back of the pack.
Wow thats impressive she might get a scholarship one day!
I imagine that must be so awful. Have you had that before?
I hope the doctor can help you get the pain away!
Aw thats sweet Im glad you love her so much!
Thats good no body should ever cheat in my opinion!  At least end the relationship first.
Oh my god. Thats aweful!
Well he sounds really irresponsible. I would make him pay for the damages. 
Tell me about it they have to be in my top 5 things I hate the most.
Plus they are so small its harder to kill them for me. Flies are larger so I have an easier time getting rid of them.
Uggh what a buzzkill.
Id say that is definitely true for you now.
ok and how does that work
thats awesome but would you?
Ok why would you do that?
Call her back then since you miss her like crazy
No way! Thats sad for the man but gross for you
Wow that is disgusting
Thats awesome! Where are you vacationing to?
I love the beach! Im sure youll have a great time there.
I hate spiders! Especially if you know theres one in the room where you are sleeping!
Haha sorry Ive been in that position and chose to sleep on the couch because of it!
Thats really great that you have such a great partner like her!
I would be the same without my wife too!
Aw dang sounds like he is battling it very well though!
Ouch Im very sorry for your loss! You did your best and Im sure he is in heaven now looking over you!
I can definitely understand how you would be worried about that.  I think Id have to decline  LOL!  You are a good person for being willing to meet with him.
Well yes if there is a child involved then youve got to deal with him at some point.  I hope it goes well for you though.
Ive never watched a single full star wars movie just bits and pieces haha
Thanks I will look into it! Maybe get caught up before the new movie comes out!
You must have been surprised! Were you happy about it?
Sounds great!  What a good idea your mom had!
No way! That must have smelled so bad
I can imagine eww
Aww man sorry for your loss those are the worst its like losing your best friend. I hope he passed away peacefully and happy.
Aww shoot I lost a dog when i was little in a very tragic way as well. I miss that big guy he was like a brother to me. Hope youre doing good now hes in a good place.
Its okay! A cheat weekend every now and then can be well deserved when on a diet! Start right now eating healthy again! You can do it!
Thats awesome! Good luck with your diet!
Congratulation!  It is really smart to be as prepared as possible!  This baby will change your world!
That is good.  It will make you quite happy.  I couldnt imagine life without my kid now!
Ouch! Thats the worst are they pretty damaged?
Oh well shake it off and keep flaunting that nice car! 
Good for you! Its always so satisfying to look back and see how much youve achieved.
Nothing wrong with sleep  along with food its what keeps us going! How many hours do you work?
Yum what is she cooking?
Yum that sounds delicious! Im a vegetarian as well I will have to look into the recipe for that!
Oh wow. No Ive never had to deal with that before. I hope your husband is ok!
Thats awesome that you had such a great support network to help you. 
Umm..did you MEAN to kick it?
They are kinda like rats with wings.
Aw poor fellow well Im sure he was close to his home.
Theres always next time forgive yourself and help the next pupper you see!
Oh you must be so sad I know I would be if that had happened to me.
That is great! I have a dog that I adopted in similar circumstances. 
Oh god no my heart would be racing. Were you scared?
Damn i cant imagine ever going through that. I hope it was something minor and didnt affect you too much.
Wow that intense we all make mistakes though hope youre doing better!
Sounds great! Yes relaxing time is always needed and appreciated.
Hope you enjoy your week off! Sounds like you earned it 
I take the bus so I dont have to deal with the traffic but man that sounds like it would really stink
Wow he sounds like jerk!
I used to enjoy doing that with my grandmother shed tell me all about when my dad was little.  I love old stories like that.
What an interesting field  my husband would love to say that was his profession!
oh oh so now you dont know where your enemy is hiding.  Sounds scary.
How annoying but would be wise imagine it jumping on you while you sleep.
What kind of chair is it? A lounging chair or maybe  a computer desk chair?
Oooh thatll be really good. It aught to be really comfortable too.
Sweet! must be a really big pool if you have to wait until next summer. 
Oh yeah gets too cold. Ive always wanted one of those concrete pools. Im stuck with an above ground one for now until i get enough money for one. 
So what would you do to halt that?
Thats not good do you think he will pay you?
You can take out a loan but good luck I hope you get it!
And no one told you about it?  Maybe no one noticed it at all?
That is horrible!  I hope they realize that their reaction was not exactly nice.
Oh my! I hope is ok!
Yeah that is a really suckying thing to do to you. 
So how does he afford such luxury?
Ok he shouldnt have stopped! Other kids deserves it too
Hard work usually pays off. Which exams are you taking?
I hope she recovers soon. I know it is hard to see loved ones sick.
That is good to hear. I am sure she will be fine.
Good for you! You are a lucky person!
Thats great! Im a bit jealous.
Yeah ive been through that feeling before I had a show that was going to get cancelled but thankfully it got saved by another company. What show was yours?
Oh ive heard of that show never got around to seeing it though. That sucks!
Thats really great. Im happy for you.
Congratulations it sounds like youve really made it. I envy you.
Im sorry to hear that you couldnt finish it! What couldnt you finish?
Hey you are being too hard on yourself. Im sure your boss would prefer it done well and not rushed. 
Yes! I always cried when I watched it as a child.
Yes! My kids cried too 
Oh I love the thrill of a good roller coaster.
Its definitely not for everyone. You either love them or you dont.
I could imagine. Dogs are amazing.
Definitely. Hold on to those.
Thats great family comes first over everything!
Yep theyre always there for you no matter what
Awe! Really I was planning on seeing it this weekend. 
Really? What was the main disappointment? 
Thats nicehope you will host them well?
Uhmmnn! never knew you had room mates
What type of trip are you planning?
Oh dont stress it ive done that so many times. It happens
Yeah or buy pants without zippers. But dont stress it im sure whoever saw it didnt really mind!
Oh that sounds exciting. Ive always wanted to go.
Ive flown but not much and never left the country either. I hope yall have fun 
Theres some decent benefits to doing things the old way. 
Got anything specific you like to be traditional about?
Yes Im a picky eater.
Yes I hate that. I usually end up going back and getting some more just for me.
Thats awesome i cant imagine not having AC in this hot florida weather!
Yeah the heat isnt as bad but mix it with humidity and youve got the worst possible combination. Its terrible!
That sounds like such a surprise. Does he have a disability that keeps him at home?
Thats great to hear! My papa is getting older too. Its nice to be able to spend time with him.
Oh awesome what part of Florida?
Oh that sounds really fun and I bet she will love it all. Im jealous 
wow try next time!
well thats how fate would have it
Im sorry to hear that.  What happened?
I know how frustrating it can be when we receive so an awful service.  They should train people to do a better job.
That is so sad. I know how it feels to lose a pet.
I lost a goldfish once. She was my best friend.
Bet youll be glad to have some free time on your hands at last.
lol  yeah I can relate. Kids can be a real handful when they dont have structure  as in during the summer months.
Okay now I understand... COMPLETELY! I deal with that daily! I am ready to give up on ever cleaning again.
That sounds rather convenient. Are you giving up anything for that?
If its too traumatic for him you can always try to put him back.
Oh my goodness! What did you do? I bet your heart was racing!
hahaha that sounds about how I would have reacted! I once saw my shadow on the blinds in my living room. I sat there frozen thinking someone was outside. Then I moved and the shadow did too!
Thats awesome i dont have kids yet but i was also looking through some old school photos of me and my friends. Such innocent times.
Yes it does I wish her the best! early adulthood is the best time!
I agree and its full of commercials no one wants to see.
Oh yes I know what you are saying. Ive never been into GOT but Ive heard its good. 
I would be so mad. I cant believe people can do that and sleep at night
I hope so too. That is just not right. They could have left a note at least.
wow! love birdshow niceso where exactly are you headed?
Wellit would be a whole new experience for you
How annoying! Did she fix it fast?
That would be frustrating. Did it get corrected? Did you still have to pay?
im sorry thats awful i hope he makes a full recovery
i can only imagine!
Thats cool what is the position?
Dont wish demonstrate. Do something that reflects what type of supervisor youre going to be. People love previews.
Give me an example?
I get it. It does seem like they are always coming out with another version.
Oh thats too bad. Perhaps have the picnic indoors? It wouldnt be the same but at least you could share food and have a laugh!
I can imagine. Thats the problem with planning outside events  we cant dictate the weather. You should try planning something outdoors in Scotland where Im from  soggy food every time!!
Who has cancer? Someone you know?
Well I am no cancer expert. Probably should get a second opinion from a doctor.
LoL....no sweetie Im sure its your dog again. Didnt the same thing happen last month?
Oh sorry about that I thought you had a dog. Well then maybe the noise the some type of critter. Have you checked under the bed today?
I remember that. A lot of people were grossed out and didnt want to do it. Were your girls one of them?
Yea it tends to be kinda gross. My teacher had us dissect fish as well and I prefere that much more for some reason
I sure hope they are trustworthy.
It is so good to have someone that is trustworthy no matter what you tell them.  Im glad you have a friend like that.
Im so sorry to hear that my girlfriends cat is going through the same thing right now. It cant be easy.
Thats so sad... The best thing you can do is spend lots of time with her and make every minute count. I wish you all the best.
Usually people want someone in their life. I guess that takes staying away from others.
Some people prefer to be alone. Whatever makes them happy I suppose.
I would laugh so hard if that was me seeing my dog do that
I hope you can share it on social media so that the whole world can share in the fun 
i do too its a shame
i am too i hope we can make a change before it is too late
Lucky for you! Im at work right now! Haha!
No its fine! Enjoy your day off I definitely would if I were you!
Oh thats awful. Were you okay or did you have to go to the hospital?
That sounds terrifying! Ive never been in a car accident and sure wouldnt like to be in one.
oh wow did it bring back memories?
That is so fun!  Memories are always a wonderful thing to have
Well it is good to be thankful. We have to remember all the little things.
It is good to appreciate what we have not opine for what we dont have.
I hope you got it on camera I would if i was in your shoeas
Nice buddy he will thank you for it when he grows up
Awww good for him! 
Im glad hes getting better with his speech and I hope he continues to improve!
I hate when that happens. Im so bad with directions.
What did you end up doing?
I depend so heavily on my GPS i dont know what i would have done
Oh thats great news. I bet he is having lots of fun.
Thats great. Some people can go through college and still dont know what they want to do.
Thats a ton of oysters! I dont think Ive even ever eaten one oyster. Whats a mixed plate? 
Hmm its funny how seasonings and spices really alter the viability of a food. Was the buffet all seafood?
That is awesome to hear  i bet the pays good too 
if your happy there i would stay if not seek the better pay in a different town 
Oh man that had to be embarrassing.  I know how you feel though bc I once went to work with two different shoes on
Well it will probably never happen again so dont worry about it to much
Im so sorry. I know that must be very difficult for you. Its nice that you have pictures to look at and remember old times together.
Pictures are a great way to remember the past. I treasure every picture. Each holds a special memory.
We all do it. I bet they deserved it.
They sound like my kids. I hope they start behaving better for you.
Dogs can be so destructive.
Poor thing had no clue why you were mad
Ok so are you gonna go?
Dang three times?  I hope you get that figured out!
Yeah get that right.  Make sure you dont fail it four times!
How shocking! I have got to know are you keeping the puppies or giving them up for adoption?
Good idea. I hope they arent too much of a handful until then!
Oh that sounds horrible. I hope it wasnt a long ride on the bus. 
Oh no that is a long time to be sitting in trash basically.
i bet so. its a shame when people dont take care of their teeth
i wouldnt doubt it!
I have found that using alot of online recipes with good instructions helps. Cannabis also induces hunger and reduced adhd thus it helps me pay better attention even more so when Im hungry af! 
yes I always pay attention to the reviews and peoples personal comments they can often be priceless!
Not that I can think of. Can you give me an example?
Oh I see what you mean. Thats frustrating!
Did you at least study for it?
That is the best feeling!
Oh wow that really sucks. Did you ever find the culprit?
Yeah I wouldve definitely quit once I saw that.
I hate when they do that! Were you able to clean the rug?
I bet! Time to get him trained a little better.
Wow that is huge. He must have a lot of stuff to haul.
As long as he remembers to make wide turns. Otherwise bad things happen haha.
Has it ever been a ghost?
Yeah fears like that are pretty unconsolable.
Thats so awesome! What did he say?
Oh my. What a strange first word.
Im not quite sure I understand did you go bowling by yourself? If so thats so sad and lonesome.
As someone who deals with lonesome moments I know how that feels. I wouldve totally gone with you had I known you haha.
did you feel like being spontaneous or just did it for the thrill of it
next time you go in put the money of the candy into one of those charity cans
Yeah me too! Are you going to go with anyone?
Nice! I am sure it is going to be a ball of a time.
That is a real bummer. Maybe you should take some time to reflect on their life.
Yeah no need to talk to me about it right now. Think about all the good times you had together.
That really stinks. Have you gone to get some help on it?
I am sure he will be able to help you. I hope you pass.
Oh no. That sounds like a messy situation.
Hopefully hell learn that thats not the place to do that.
I am sure once you clean up your scruffy look youll be able to land all the ladies.
Nah you can forgo deodorant. The media just tells everyone its necessary since its a poorly known method of government mind control.
He must be related to my dog. Was it hard to clean up?
You may want to check his diet. Something in not right there.
That is so awesome! Good for her!
Amazing! I would be proud if I were you as well!
Really I cant believe you like it. Are you sure he bought it and not his mom lol?
Either way you have the perfect outfit to go on a date with your boyfriend right?
Oh no! Is your dog trained to go outside?
Im sorry to hear that. Just take some deep breaths wear gloves and maybe even a mask if it makes you feel better. You can do this and youll be alright!
Yeah I am the same way. Incredibly unsafe to do such a thing.
I know. I dont want to die doing something incredibly mundane.
i hope you feel bad about what you did 
as long as you can live with yourself  is all that matters lol
That sounds very relaxing. What kind of book was it?
Oh I get that magazine too. I like it for the stories.
Dang. What did you by? Mountain dew and doritos?
A much better purchase than the neckbeards staple. I hope you won!
That sucks was it a nice rug?
Thats awful put the dogs nose in it.
Nice! Which one you getting?
Dang! Now that is a savvy phone! I have 12 of them.
Aw how wonderful. She must have been really proud of herself and happy.
Truth be told I never learned how to ride a bike.
That sounds like an interesting life choice. Its probably very calming.
Its an important tool set to have!
Have you been studying? If you do that I am sure you wont fail.
Nice! I am sure you will pass with flying colors.
You are the 2nd one today. Was it a mile high?
That must have been quite the workout. At least you should have plenty of fuel for the winter.
oh thats a nice surprise
thats really cool
Shocking. Does that not happen often for you?
Ah well better than me. I get it so much it doesnt even bother me anymore.
Lol owning it is just about the only thing you can do at that point!
I hope nobody in your office is the easily offended type!
Nice! Did you steal anything while you were there?
Well at least you filled your stomach. Next time dont forget about your pockets!
Congratulations thats amazing.  What did he say?
Wow hes a pretty smart kid.  He must be reading up on his history and the communist manifesto.
Thats too bad. Did someone cut you off?
Awww I would be sad too. Did anyone go and get it?
Understandably so. You must be pretty anxious over the whole ordeal.
Thats a great idea. No need to let go of the place you call home completely. I hope everything works in your best interests!
thats fair tho i wouldnt worry about it
good luck with that
That is a very nice friend. Moving is hard work.
Hope you dont have to move again any time soon.
I hate when that happens.  I bet that smelled great.
My dog did that the other day.  I yelled at her and told her that we dont poop in the house
Nice! Did you fall?
Oh no! Well at least it sounded like you and everyone had a good time.
eww i know how that feels
Oh geez! I bet that was a CATastrophe!
I bet. I wouldve been sick.
lol sorry for laughing  but that sounds like something i would agree to and forget im afraid of heights too 
sometimes when my friends are annoying me  i tune out ... later o yeah we are supposed to do this today and blah  blah  blah
Oh thats a good point! I never realized how much money I was spending for fast food until I started making a budget.
My go to lazysandwich are fried balogna sandwiches. Its saved me a lot of money thats for sure.
That sucks. Are you hurt?
I would be mad too. Are you going to sue?
thats so amazing
thats so cool
That is unfortunate. I hope it wasnt 1 or 2 miles high?
That amount of poop really does things to a rug. I recommend getting a new house.
That sucks. Did you ever find any worms in the apples?
Yeah if only I could go back and have a crisp apple with some snake oil...all would be right with the world.
Mustve been some good convincing.  Was it a robbery?
Yea my phone is pretty expensive.  Im not giving my phone to anybody
im not sure i think its just an old tradition
Where did you lose it at?
Yeah that is a good thing he found it and not someone else. What are the odds.
They are so lucky. I would love to have a new car.
I would be jealous because I drive an old clunker 
Oh no! Thats horrible. Were you able to clean it up?
I could imagine.
thats great good job.
yea i tend to have similar issues
happy birthday! are you exciteD?
i hope you have a great time
Oh boy did you embarrass yourself by getting real scared?
Thats something thats easy to laugh about after the fact but I bet you were running for your life when it happened! Haha
I know what you mean.  Its an easy chore but sometimes that smell is gross.  Its that sweet smell. yuck
Well now i definitely dont want to take the garbage out tonight.  Ill make someone else do it
oh really? why was that?
understandable no one should have to go hungry
Thats horrible! What happened?
That really sucks. I am glad you are okay.
That really sucks. Maybe you should get another job?
I am truly sorry for your lots. I am sure things will get better.
Well thats great! Im guessing he has a bad habit of doing that?
I guess youve been training him and its paying off? Tell him hes a good boy and give him a belly rub!
Oh thats so aggravating my dog still has accidents but not many
Thats terrible but the rug is replaceable. 
im sorry to hear that my child hood friend died in a car crash  and it hurt me for a really long time i still have dreams about him through out the years
his family must be going through some tough times right now  i hope everything goes well
Ive actually heard a little bit about CBD oil from my sister but I never did any research myself or try it out.
Oh wow so it actually works? I might have to give it a try and let me mother know about it she has a lot of pain in her legs as well.
I absolutely will! Thanks for the suggestion.
That sounds like so much fun.  What concert is it?
Dont stop believin.  I bet youll have a great time!
I wouldnt look forward to that either. What are you going in for?
That doesnt sound grand at all. Hopefully it is a painless procedure.
Thats super nice of her!
Good parents are super useful!
That sounds like a job!
I wish you good luck with that!
Why did you steal candy from the store?
Did you not have any money to pay for it?
Oh no!  Is that the first time it has happened?
May I recommend gloves?  Thick gloves.  And a lot of carpet cleaner.
Wow that really stinks. Did you catch the culprit?
Yeah especially since I imagine that is a costly monthly expense. I would install some turrets in your garage.
Thats always fun to clean up.
Think of it this way. Yesterday I had to clean up my dogs vomit where it vomited up a used tampon.
Nice! Which game is it?
Sounds really fun! I think I will pick it up today.
Thats cool. What city?
Oh sweet. I hope he has a good time in college.
Oh Im so sorry to hear that. How long did you have your rabbit for?
I could imagine. I dont have any pets. But I understand it can be really devastating.
Oh no! Were you able to clean it up?
Yeah hopefully it doesnt happen again!
Ew! Sounds like a disgusting job.
Thats great! Good to hear youre saving some money!
I do too but seems like most people are like that nowadays
I would be mad we had that problem all the time at the last place we lived. 
Oops. Could you sneak it back in without him seeing you?
Depends how close you are and how mad hell be. Usually I advocate honesty but dont know enough about your situation to advise.
Oh boy. I honestly dont know what to say. Maybe ask him outright if hes cheating. If he is do you really want to stay with him? If not it doesnt matter if he knows about the phone or not!
Good luck! But be nice  Ive confronted people before and totally lost it. I then regretted it.
That sucks hope it didnt dry into the carpet.
Thats pretty understandable.
thats great good job
i know that feel
Nice! Where is he going to school at?
Wow thats pretty far away. How do you feel about him going all the way up there?
dangit  i would have been pretty upset  not to mention the clean up 
shhhhhheeeeess  that would have given me a small heart of attack or just tunnel vision out of rage
Thats so sad! Maybe you should give him a call?
Thats the spirit! The loneliness should melt away!
Oh no!! You must have been so mad!
That dog probably wouldnt be living in my house anymore!! Did you have it cleaned?
That is not good.  Did you scold your cat?
I can imagine.  My dog used to stain the carpet too.
That really sucks. What kind of car was it?
Ah I used to have one of those. Those cars were built to last.
I think the opposite honestly.
Yeah I know thanks.
What happened?? You did not studied hard enough?
the best thing for you is learn from this and do better next time 
That was nice of your neighbor! I hope everything was still inside of it!
Thats such a relief! Its such a hassle to cancel all of your credit cards and get a new ID! You should give him a reward!
Nice! What grade is your son in?
Nice! I am sure he is going to be hanging with the popular folk in no time.
Ha! At least youre confident in your skills. Do you do anything special to it?
That is all good to know! Ill have to keep it in mind next time I cook it.
That is terrible I am so sorry. Was it of natural causes?
You can just replace him that fast? Dont you need time?
Thats pretty brave of you facing a fear like that.  How did you feel when the flight was over?
Flights are convenient though.  Definetly faster than driving somewhere
How exciting! Where to?
I am happy for you and hope you have a lot of fun!
Congratulation! thats awesome. I know how much work that can be
Youll get there one day.  It takes time and saving 
Lol are they still holdig that against you?
Lol. We all cheated at some point.  They know that.
Did you try to find someone to go with?
Maybe you should find some new friends.
Mine did too  5 minutes ago actually. Are you thinking about getting a new one?
Thats too bad. Perhaps it would help you heal your troubles away.
Hell yeah! Return of the king!
Yup hes been through a lot
Oh yeah. Makes for a great game when its close!
I am so happy for you! I have been married for ten years and it is the most rewarding thing ever. But you should be nervous because in two months you have to share everything.
Thank you . Well lets talk about the wedding hopefully you have a wedding planner to help you right. I dont want you to stress out to much you are the excited bride!
Well good let her do all the worrying and you focus on your big day!
Oh wow thats kind of rude.
Have you brought it up to her? Maybe she doesnt realize shes doing it.
where did it go?
I hope so hope is still alive and Have you search everywhere?
Oh no! How did you find out?
Ah I see. I hope you find someone more respectful and caring
Oh that is awesome! Even barely awesome employers are hard to find.
Yeah they generally have a better chance at giving it more so than large entities.
Oh yeah especially when it is something you are really looking forward to receiving.
Yep but at least we have the internet to take care of those things.
did you try redoing your steps of the last day? to see maybe you left it at a friends house
i feel bad for you have you tried asking other people that are near you often to see if they have seen it?
What do you love about football season? Theyre football right?
Wonderful! Good luck I hope they win.
What are they repeating?
I hope you can provide them with some help.
Its awesome. Sometimes I also try to find solutions in youtube.
Yeah youre right.
Thats terrible. Did you guys clear that out?
People must have no lives to want to spread rumors like that.
Oh my. How did you handle the situation with your toddler?
They can be pretty crazy at that age.
I bet your so excited! I just got one last month too and it makes my life so much easier!
AOL slow Lol.. I certainly know how you feel! I would have expedited it to me!
where did he go
Im assuming they didnt leave insurance info?
That sucks man. Are you gonna get it fixed?
Yikes high risk investment?
Is it something that can recover over time? I hope so
A lot of marriages also end in divorce when they go into it too soon.
Youll find someone. You sound like a good person.
why did your friendship with your friend ended?
that is true i agree with you that is not what friends do
For what purpose you do this
How his your health now
You sound lonely. Do you not have any friends?
Have you considered joining any hobby groups to make some new friends?
oh thats sweet. congrats
im sure it wont take you long with that degree
Thats terrible!  Were you in a bad part of town or anything?
That kind of thing always creeps me out.  Glad you made it ok!
Why is that is there something scheduled today that you really are trying to avoid?
My first marriage was much like that I hope you have a very calm day and no arguing.
Great job!  Did anything else come with it?
Yeah anything is better than nothing.  Good work!
did you take it in to get fixed?
ah i understand now
I hear you! What made you feel all alone?
Oh okay! Where did they go?
What time was that?
Wow long time! Are you still at this job?
Complaint them about the product
OMG. Thats unfair
You must be proud. What kind of cake did you make.
I love tres leche.  I havent had a slice of that in forever.
Oh god. Are you ok?
Weve all been embarassed at work lol. Dont even worry about it.
Did you propose her?
Oh so sad. You may try one more time.
What was the size?
Oh cool! Does he have a country club membership? What were you doing that you couldnt go?
Oh I am sorry! Bummer to miss out
Oh I bet that was so good
That is always a good feeling
How long does film school last?
So you have two dogs? That is so nice I love dogs.
Beautiful sounds like she is in good hands. 
they must have something against trucks
thats true and also not a good sign if a cop decides to pull you over
Is your current ceiling fan broken?
Nice I hope you enjoy it.   Grats on the house too.
OH! I do too! They are so healthy and you can get them without any sugar too!
Oh...well you should try it without fruit itself is already full of sugar  If you try the ones with orange juice they can be pretty sweet on their own.
Im sorry to hear that sounds like family took a trip?
Im glad the bad times have stopped and hope your furkids can help cheer you up. I feel lonely at times too its only human.
Oh yes they are! I love it when that happens
Lol! Cool what kind of memory did it trigger?
Oh you are brave! I LOVE the ocean but I am terrified of being in the middle of it 
How fast are they supposed to be going?
Theres a lot of selfish people in the world and a lot of impatient ones too. Its extremely frustrating.
did you mute it
i hate when that happens
We dont see many here. Do you live in a city?
Well the city probably should do something about it.
What happened to make him flood things? Something overflowed?
Thats too bad. Well I hope it didnt ruin anything special??
What happened? Is she undergoing it for depression or what?
So disgusting to see such irresponsible parents bringing up a child in such conditions. Hope for him to be well
That sucks.  Someone in a parking lot do  that to you?
and I bet they just drove off and didnt even leave a note.
it sure does feel  good that someone notices
That has to be really annoying.  Have you called animal control?
Yes thats one way to deal with it.  What did you end up doing?
Im sorry to hear that. Was there something going on around you that made you scared?
Wooded ares are beautiful until you have to be alone in them when its dark.
What was impressive about that?
Everyone knew he was going to do it though
that sounds cool
i bet it was
That sounds like so much fun. Ive actually never been to a casino but would love to.
I would feel the same way. Im not always very lucky though so Id be a little apprehensive at first.
Im sure shell be happy with whatever gift you got her.
What was it that she wanted?
Wow.  How much did they win?
Jeez thats a lot!  I hope they can manage it ok.
you try calling for a status update?
ah it happens i guess
Pets are great companions! What kind of pet is it?
Wow I was not expecting that! Im happy that you get to spend time with it.
Why? Whats going on? Or yknow not going on ?
Is there something going on thats got you feeling that way?
Slippery floor or slippery you ?
Oh been there before. Sometimes Im given things that make me very unsteady.
what did she do? woke up late?
ah yea mine does that.. i have a spray bottle for days like that 
Oh no. That is gorrible
Did the person stop?
Why on earth would someone do that? A totally pointless act!
Some people will steal anything I guess. A store employee once told me they had to keep certain things by the checkout or they walked!
It sure is! I got caught when I was about 8 bouncing a ping pong ball while leaving a toy store. The owner took me home and my Dad gave me a hiding. Never again!
Oh yes. While other teenagers were thieving I was being a very good little girl! Hope you get a replacement for your trash can.
Howd they do?
Good for them
On your car?? Did you get it on camera?
Oh bummer! I cant stand it when people are that selfish! I wish we had CCTV cameras everywhere like they do in the UK
i bet it was!
i wouldnt even try that
Sounds annoying she needs to be more careful
Oh wow like for law school? or what you take after law school?

I would have been as well how late was it? 
sounds super scary! my god. 
Oh lord! Why did you need to lie?
Oh ok! Well I can understand that.
aweee you got puppies? i barely sleep so i feel you
thats so sweet of you that you adopted an abused dog and taking care of her
Im sorry to hear that. Why couldnt you go home?
Thats crazy! Is it always so busy?
what did you say
oh well .. next time will be easier
That sounds crappy! When do they close? 
Sounds like a good idea! I would do the same. 
Storms can be quite scary! Is it over now?
Hopefully thats the last storm for a while.
Thats awesome! I hope its a good paying job.
I know what you mean I hate job searching.
What kind of pet was it
Oh that sounds scary
oh im sorry to hear that
well it sounds like it has gotten a little easier which is always good.
My cat hasnt been feeling well this past week I think there might be something really wrong.
For the vet to see me cat.
did he pass away?
have you gotten a new pet or still too soon?
Oh no how big is the dent?
Not too bad. Is it deep?
I bet you are a happy parent then
I guess thats all kids though
Sounds really fun do you go kayaking often? 
I bet you are going to go more often now. Kayaking is really enjoyable. 
thats awesome news! congrats
is it going to be a big wedding or small?
Why did you have to walk home alone?
Thats awful. Are you ok now?
I do too! Do you feel like you are prepared?
Maybe practice with a friend or spouse! That may help you feel a little more confident.
i think you are right about that
Whats happening next week? 
Oh thats right mine arent old enough yet so I dont have that type of joy but im happy for you! ha ha 
Audis are pretty nice. You must feel a bit jealous hu?
He might have a large monthly payment.
ah damn!! it would have been pretty embarrassing!!
She must have been shy to tell you that
Oh man what do you think happened to it?
Ive had that happen. Are you going back to get it?
How long have you been working there for? 
Kinda creepy then that you are randomly the only one there 
Thats awesome. Do you workout regularly?
I should get to that as well.
That was very nice of you though
It was still a nice thing to do
Yea that can be hard sometimes. Im sure will understand.
Im sure she knows how hard you work to provide for her.
hard work pays of
keep up the good work!
Gross! Do you work in a restaurant?
Thats sucks. I bet all that food smells.
Congratulations! Thats getting to the point where you look at their homework and realize you forgot how difficult it was ha.
Oh Lord I have forgotten almost everything I learned in Algebra and beyond.
Oh wow. How long has it been since you last spoke with her?
Thats awesome. I know you were happy to receive that in the mail! 
do you give them money?
yea me too
oh damn!! did you find who it was?
ah that sucks!! bad luck!!
Oh no! Did you actually see them do it? 
That is really frustrating. Were you able to claim it on your insurance? I cant imagine how frustrating that must have felt. 
I bet that was fun. Like where? A museum or something Lol
Oh wow that is surprising. Did you guys have a picnic?
thats a mess and i feel pity for you
Use thinner which is used for painting  i think that ought to do
Stay positive you never know. Maybe send them a polite email saying thank you for the interview and things you liked about the company.
It cant hurt! Just keep on applying even to job that are above or below your skill levels.
What were young to do with your freetime?
Oh I have always wanted to do that
what did he do to it?
Nice Im sure you are a great uncle! Its fun to be youthful sometimes and relive childhood memories!
Yes defenitly! I see my daughter who is a toddler and love to see all that life in her!
mine started today!!
thats always good when they cant wait to return
Thats always disappointing. In time for what?
Oh thats too bad. I am sure you felt bad but your son probably understood.
Sounds like life is finally moving the right direction for you its great to be thankful for the simple things in life!
Yes  people get so caught up in material things and forgot how blessed they are to have food and shelter!
Whys that? What happened?
That can be scary! Theres usually nobody in the woods though luckily.
did you call the popo ?
yea they are dumb.
wow that sounds nice
hard work pays off i guess
Great where will you be going ?
Dont take too much money with you.
You should make a sign that says something about your lunch on it?
are you able to go real early before the crowds get there?
ah that makes sense
Its awesome. Hope youre getting promotions at right time.
Good for you!
Were you supposed to?
I hope they get it figured out for you. How frustrating. 
Why was he suspended did he do something wrong?
Did it every get straightened out that sounds pretty terrible.
Well thats different at least.
what do you do to get prepared
thats a smart idea
What kind of dog was it?
Was it a big one?
Why were you late
That happened to me too I hate it
yea i also love my sister pet
yea its fun
tell me about it.
Thats good   Having a good family always makes life easier.
I bet!  Mine have been really great too!
Thats terrible! How long did you study for it?
I bet you put a lot of effort into it. Maybe you could talk to him and plead your case to get him to reconsider.
That mustve been scary what kind of mask!
Do you plan on getting her back later?
Maybe try a freddy mask this time.
Thats good to hear! How long is the vacation for?
Thats not too bad. I hope you have a fun and relaxing vacation!
what kind of sub is it
ah that sounds tasty
What kinda glass?
Hell probably be upset but Im sure hell come around. It was an accident.
Im sorry to hear that you got to check though.
What happened that lead to it?
Yay!  I love dogs!  Do you have any you want to get specifically or are you just going to look until you find one that clicks?
Congratulations!  Im sure shes going to be super happy!
Im sorry to hear that did you do anything to not feel so lonely?
Ah I see. Was it a good kind of alone then?
is that a good thing or bad thing?
oh congrats then. i hope all goes well for them!
have you gone to the doctor yet? or is it not that serious
oh ok so it is just a  common cold then?
Im sorry to hear that! Is it that busy at work?
Oh are you a teacher?
thats great of him to stick by her side. you dont see that anymore
thats a good story.
What did you get in debt for?
Was it worth it?
Oh wow! Thats amazing. Congratulations!
Are you undergrad or grad student?
Thats awesome! Life moves fast doesnt it?
Oh so hes your little brother? You must be so proud of him.
Wow. Id just use that as motivated to get better. Im sure you can get to her level or exceed it with some deligence.
We cant compare ourselves to others. Itll just make you miserable. There will always be someone who is better in something. You could be better at something that someone else isnt.
oh wow.. gonna be the next bobby flay!
If you have the drive for it im sure you will do great!
Parking lot accidents are so rampant.
Are you gonna get it repaired?
It sure did. Did you get a chance to relax and have some fun?
So am I. Would you be okay with longer work days then?
Nice friend. All of mine have been gone for decades.
Sure is last time I saw one was some time in the 90s.
where is your trip at? why are you so exited
wow i have always wanted to go to las vegas good luck and dont gamble all your money haha
I love package delivery days!  Ive got a couple coming as well.  What are you waiting for?
Oh wow a big package!  Hope you enjoy it!
Ouch... Id have to admit that it would make me a tad nervous.
Absolutely! That is definitely the attitude to have. Trust is huge in making a relationship successful. Its just natural to feel a bit nervous.
hahaha you must be so proud! How long did it take you to teach him?
Man Id love to see that!
Dang heartbreaking. If I were your coworker and you told me that Id lend you at least a couple bucks for the vending machines or something. Hopefully you can go home and have a nice dinner.
Ah there you go. The world isnt completely heartless. Yeah I think the trick is to always keep that stuff with your car keys because then youll never forget it.
Ouch that sucks.   Honestly if you had a crappy obamacare bronze plan its unlikely theyd pay for anything anyways.  Its always a nightmare.    Youve got to spend a fair amont of cash before they cover anything but a checkup.
Yep youll probably be fine. Give it a couple of days. 
thats a bad feeling  dont be too hard on yourself 
Yeah but its a test! Its not like you cheated on your spouse or did something severe! lol 
That is always a good feeling. 
Thats the spirit. It is always exciting to start something new.
That must be so nice having that freedom.
Do you feel you could see yourself marrying her?
Lucky you my girlfriend Elaine is a bit mean sometimes.
I love dogs! I bet you were so happy. 
Oh my god Ive always wanted a husky! You are so lucky. They do have beautiful eyes.
Oooh thats exciting!  What schools did you apply for?
Thats worth being nervous over.  Im sure youll do great!
Oh yeah what do you plan on doing? 
Sounds like a good time! 
did you have some back up clothes ?
Im sorry that made me laugh. Never really seen a parrot speak that well before. Thought it as just something you see in movies. Does it say anything else fun?
Thats... a really interesting strategy. Wonder what will happen once he actually does lose weight and doesnt want to be called fat anymore! Well I guess to each their own.
Im so sorry to hear that. Its hard losing someone that dear to her. I hope she opens herself up to healing.
Its gonna take some time and Im sure those phone calls help more than you think.
I did that 32 years ago in high school.
Right I understand that. Its not a nice thing.
What is your wifes name?
Do you love her lots?
thats a bummer! How long ago did you lose it? 
Well I hope you find it and a winning lotto ticket at the same time. 
Good to hear! Congrats!!
Hope youll receive more bonus in upcoming days!!
what did you all make
that sounds tasty.
did he do it in a normal fashion or did he stared at you weird
you should have told someone that is how robbers usually target people
Thats great! Are you trying to buy a house?
Its nice to have a place of your own. I remember the excitement I felt when I bought my house.
thats good that it wasnt major.
Thats a good way to go into an interview. Did it go well?
Awesome congrats on your new job.
I bet you cant wait. Is it a substantial raise?
Thats fantastic. Congratulations! Buy yourself a little treat.
Im glad youve found a change of pace.
Of course it is. Id say itll benefit each other.
Oh no! Im sorry to hear that you dont have enough money for food but stealing isnt the answer! Maybe theres a local food bank you can contact.
Call your local support services. Usually its 211. They can put you in contact with charities churches and other organizations who can help you! I wish you the best!
Did you ask him to wash the dishes?
You should do to him a strong amount of punishment!
I hope your dog is found safe!
i hope it goes well!
That is fantastic. Anything new going on?
I wish I was that content with my life. I have too many changes going on right now.
I bet it did. I would love to listen to my old cds
What a fun way to reminisce. 
Yeah youre right. are you in reunion now?
Its very hard to leave. But the memories will always cheer with us. 
Did you prepare for it?
Its not too late. You will have to pull an all nighter and study. If you are prepared you will feel better about going.
Are you going to get another?
Probably best to also take time to process what happened
Amazing! How old is he?
Good on him! For what its worth Im super proud of him! 
That must be annoying what kind of dog?
Maybe try asking the neighbor about him?
Oh no Im sorry to hear that. What kind of test was it?
Calculus seems like very hard stuff for anyone. Dont feel too down. Just use this as motivation to study more!
Thats the spirit! Never quit and give up. Everyone fails sometimes.
Do you have a rather large family?
Will you have music and dance?
Maybe you should confront them about it.
Heck yeah. Tackle the issue head on! Maybe itll workout and theyll try to be nicer.
Aw thanks. I hope it all works out for you. Have a great day!
Oh no what happened? Why dont you think you did well?
I hope its better than you expect!
Ooh that is rough having to prepare for. How do you think you did?
Thats awesome! Im so glad to hear that! Hopefully this boosts your confidence for next time now you know you can do it.
oh its really frustrating and not fair
ok dont feel bad be happy and search for your future behalf
Warcraft  thats an online role play game right?
Im afraid I avoid those games  too addictive. Id never get anything else done! Presumably you play.
Hmm. Perhaps I should have a look then. I just have such an addictive personality  Hopeless!
Oh there are plenty of those believe me lol. At least you enjoy it tho. Thats good.
I know is it like when I got my new car?
A ford mustang I always like muscle cars!
Pontiac makes good cars. But more importantly your wardrobe mishap is a little funny sorry. Hope everything worked out.
Thats awesome! Did you get a good deal?
Some people enjoy fixing things. That will be fun if youre ready for it. What kind of car did you get?
Not me. Id be walking if i did. 
YouTube makes things so much easier to learn. 
Oh jeeze. Did they catch them on film?  Hopefully insurance will take care of it.
won the lottery?
well thats good too!
I love animals! What kind of pet does she have?
Oh wow thats unusual. 
uh oh! Have you checked your sugar lately?
After that bag of candy you may want to!
Im jealous of you. Im a little introverted and antisocial and never got good at developing friendships where I could make them longlasting and trustworthy. Good for you
Yeah since Ive been in college Ive been forced to socialize more and Im getting better at it. Its a muscle just like anything else I guess and you have to work it out. 
Thats great! Anything helps as you said keep trying for more!
We certainly need to do better as a country to make higher education more affordable.
Oh what kind of relationship is it?
Yikes stop the relationship at all cost!
Are you happy for her?
Well if you treat her right she wont go any where. 
Oh yea? Is it for higher pay or just needing a different scenery?
Is the new city have a higher cost of living?
I feel you man.  Im off in 1 hour and 11 minutes.  tick tock.
Its a small world... maybe we even work at the same place.
Oh god I think weve all gone through that. Did you have nice undies on though?
Oh thats not too bad then!
Its pretty good! Hope you had a good time!
Sure. Visit again and suggest your friends too.
Oh boy! Is it yours?
I love puppies. What kind of breed is it?
Have you tried driving around and looking for it? Or calling the neighbors for help? Maybe they have seen it.
I hope they are able to locate him! Check to see if your friend had it microchipped.
It is tough! Do you have family nearby?
That would be hard. 
Cool. Girl or boy?
Are yo going to spoil him?
I know what you mean lol
Oh boy what are you going to do?  Do you have a good bus system you can use?
I hear you!  I hate physical activity that seems unnecessary. 
HAHAHAHAHA.  I love that plan!
Oh goodness! That is terrible to hear! Have you contacted someone to help clean it up? That can easily cause mold.
Try seeing if your insurance with cover it. If not grab a shop vac or 2! They are great at sucking up water out of tight spaces
Thats a bummer.  Did you make her chicken noodle soup
Thats good shes got a nurturing  caring mom I know some pretty bad parents out there
They never learn do they ?
Oh well we tried didnt we.
Thats so nice of you to be supportive to your friend through struggles.  Is it a long time struggle or something sudden?
Thats awful.  Its so good they have someone like you who is there for them when they need you most.
Oh well you will get it clean
I guess try and get those done first
Congratulations! I bet youre happy.
Im super happy for you! Youll do great.
That is great what kind of dancer is she?
Im impressed where did she win the medal?
Thats awful. Is she alright now?
Hope she will be fine soon!
That is pretty unsettling.  Whereabouts do you live
I used to live close to North Minneapolis and I would always hear people fighting in the streets and every once in a while a gunshot.  Got pretty desensitized to it though
What is a clean fade
Oh it sounds kind of cool
Thats a shame. What is it that prevents you from getting them done?
Financial constraints are definitely a good reason. Maybe one of your friends could help you out.
Cool Do they have tournaments?
Me either lol. I wold be a good water boy lol
Thats some really good progress right there
I guess that could make you regret even the things you never thought og
What was the basic jist of what they were saying?
Thats something I personally struggle with. I never feel like I have enough money to hand out but theres many people worse off than me who could use it.
That is amazing what level is the team?
That is even more impressive!  I know they take hockey seriously up there so your friend must be pretty darn good.
I hope he does.  It would be good to have a friend in the NHL!
You must be some proud of that.
Do you think she has a future in music?
Nice were they guy friends or girl friends
Why did you feel cocky...did you talk to any hotties at the bar or what
Oh how do they go for that?
Do they like you doing that?
I do not believe that
I hate when that happens did you try to get a refund?
Well hopefully they get it resolved. Does not help your lunch today however.
I dont blame you!  I wouldve been furious if some girl was talking to my husband that way.  Ridulous how awful some people are.
Ha ha thats a good one.  
I would hate that. Luckily my dog makes enough noise for 5! My kids are grown and gone too.
Pitwolf hybrid. She helps so much.
gosh that is horrible! Did you try to call the company? next time chooe a company that guarantees they will come or the service is free
oh yes i understand i had no choice either. there is only one provider in my area
Im dealing with the same thing right now! I had to teach her how to parralel park yesterday! It is terrifying! 
You can take her to the DMV when they are closed! They will allow you to use there set up to help.
Im so sorry to hear that. How long has it been if I may ask?
I am very sure he was proud of you and cherished every moment he could spend with you while he was alive.
That sounds like a fun event
I am sure you will get it soon as well
Thats more rare than diamonds.  Youd better hold on to him
Awesome.  Can I get his number 
There is no better feeling than getting off of work!
Maybe you can knock off 43 minutes early.
That is the worst!
Thats too bad. What age is he?
Oh no! Does he have the option of taking it again?
Oh no! I would have a heart attack! Are you able to take time away from life so unexpectedly to spend time with them?
hahaha I would have been like a mad woman trying to clean too! I hope it works out and your husband can take time off!
Have you thought about cutting it down?
Sounds pretty creepy
Impressive what do you plan to do with the degree?
Cool I hope you find success and that your hard work pays off. 
Thats the worst what did you eat then?
Oh no! You should try to find the culprit and confront them
Hahahahaha.  Im sorry for laughing but that struck me as funny.  Is he trying his best or is he trying to get the point across that he shouldnt be cooking?
That might be a good Christmas present.  You could do it as a couple.  I did one of those with my wife last year and it was a blast.
I hear those wildfires are getting really bad. I hope they dont affect you too badly.
Drive safe! I really hope they can get those wildfires under control soon. 
Oh Im so excited for you! I hope you get a raise too!
Me too! As long as its not bad news right?
That would be hard can one work independently? 
Im sure you are doing an amazing job you seem to care which makes you a great parent.
I am sorry to hear that what did you dog do to make you angry?
I hate to hear that hopefully you were able to get your garden lined out.
Oh my goodness that must have been humiliating.  What did you do?
Did it happen after you got out of the pool?
I am so sorry that happened to you.
Oh my gosh thats the dream haha. What did you eat the most of?
Wow thats dedication. I guess those plates add up. Thats not a very nice policy for a restaurant to have.
Awesome what was it for?
Be grateful. Most people dont have a team to make them look good by comparison.
Dont look a gift horse in the mouth D
hahaha.   Kids are wonderful. 
Well thats wonderful that you had a supporting aunt like that. How do you think you did on your test?
Well Im real glad for you! You should make your aunt a pie or something sometime.
haha..yeah it is kid of pointless but it is a little fun as a kid. im sure your son will remember 
i agree. i remember a lot of obscure things that my parents are surprised i remember.
Excellent! Which beach?
where are you guys going? 
thats awesome! how long are you staying there? im sure you will enjoy your time. i went to mississippi a couple of months ago to see my family it was so awesome
Do you sleep better when it rains too?
Oh well at least you get to listen to it now
Oh no! Have you tried the old put it in a bag of rice trick?
Give it a few days even though it feels like a million. Ill cross my fingers for you! Im so sorry that is a huge bummer!
oh no! im sorry to hear that. I wish i could come over and help you clean up
thats good. what are you having for dinner?
Oof are you sure you dont want to try a half marathon first? Youll need to train quite a bit before doing a full marathon
Oh! Well then stay hydrated! I hope you do well!
Dont worry. Soon youll get good friends.
Yeah you should explore it!
glad to hear that. im guessing you have studied hard?
congratulations!! im glad to hear that. was the exam hard?
Oh no that is terrible. Is there anyone near you that could be of help? Maybe a family member or someone that can lend a hand or ear? Im so sorry to hear this.
I know it means swallowing some pride but if its financial help you need perhaps you could go the route of Gofundme? or maybe government services? I know it might be embarrassing to some people but sometimes your back is against the wall you have nothing to lose.
Im happy that you got a new turkey friar and fried your first turkey. You do seem like you would enjoy that. 
Hey some people are on this planet to fry birds and some people arent. I guess thats just how it is.
I understand how you feel.  My sister struggled to get pregnant. She did invitro twice.   
The first one didnt work. Apparently the second one did.... but thats supposed to be a secret for now.  Shes supposed to surprise me and my father with shirts....  my mom is a loud mouth and spilled the beans though.
Yeah.  Apparently shes just as bad as my sisterss Mother in law.  She spent a good amount of time complaining about it.
Sounds wonderful!  Nothing better than putting your feet up at the end of the day.  Think you might watch some tv?
Hope you have an enjoyable evening and relaxing sleep!  Love me some tv too!  Im watch Great Food Truck Race tonight!
Oh no! Im sure it was awful at the time but itll be a good story when he grows up!
That is too funny. Theyll grow out of it soon enough!
That sucks. What type of team?
Thats amazing how old is your son these days?
Thats nice that you can share things like that it seems like your family is very close!
That sounds risky but at the same time if it works out convenient! 
I am sure it will be fine!  Its not like you dont know where they live haha
Ive never cried at work but Ive wanted to lol.
Yeah they can be. But sometimes you just got to tough it out.
Youre doing good.
Lovely. I too love pets.
Oh thats nice you guys get to throw a party if you want haha
I bet youll do great.  I would be nervous too.  Hopefully it wont be anything too serious and more cut and dry decision.  Have you gone before?
i have never been before since I was either very ill or had babieskids.  Good luck and dont stress too much. Youll be great!
I hate when they do that. They make it so hard to pay for
They sound like a shady hospital to me
Oh boy. I know just how you feel. Could you persuade them to go to a restaurant?
Good for you! Id be so busy yelling at my husband Id forget to cook lol. Do you know them well?
Well thats at least something! Its when he decides to invite the boss and his wife over when youd decided dinner was mac n cheese  thats when it gets hairy!
That would be scary! Were you able to catch her?
Thats good there is nothing scarier than a fur baby missing!
Wow thats so cool! I wish i could rock climb.
I can understand that. I have MS so Im no stranger to autoimmune diseases.
Why did you lie to her?
Oh well you a very naughty person.
That would be tough. I think I was one of the last ones not required to take foreign language.
I wish you the best in dealing with this.
I hear you on that. Im visiting my girlfriend but she still has to work so the weekend is really the only time we can hang out. Do you have any special plans?
Thats a good idea. We actually did that last weekend. I guess it makes sense to do that as much as you can before summer is over. I hope you have a nice time!
Oh my gosh I feel the same to be honest. I hate hate talking in front of a crowd.
Im sure youll be fine just try to practice as much as possible beforehand
Im sorry but that made me laugh a little bit. Ive never been able to get into the idea of cats as pets just because theyre so independent and determined to do whatever the want. Doesnt seem like they can listen to any direction you try to give them.
Yeah it works for some people. Im glad it works for you. I like my pets to be a little more needy and affectionate but sometimes sassy can be really fun and keep things interesting and lively.
That sounds exciting  where are you going!?
I love the beach being on the Gulf Coast is probably my favorite.  I hope you have a great time!
Have you been reading reviews online?
Whoa. That sounds like a very nice computer. What a surprise. That should work out pretty well.
Hey! Good luck to you! Thats got to be tough! 
For what its worth Im proud of you! 
That is a pretty big decision to make. Did she spring this up on you or was this something you knew shed eventually want?
I hope you can figure out a way to make things work out! Sounds like youre stuck between a rock and a hard place.
That profession takes a lot of courage and a unique set of skills and personality. Thats pretty cool that you took that routesometimes I think about the what if of if I took that route. Pretty sure most people have that fantasy but only the people brave enough actually go on the path to do it like you
Well at the very least from the little that youve said you seem very selfaware. Thats a very underrated trait for people to have and to develop.. so whatever it is you decide it seems like youll be efficient at seeing it through. Good luck!
Ooh thats awesome. Its great when you can spend a little extra on the fun things.
Congratulations Im glad to hear youve been able to accomplish that for yourself. 
I always wished I could do that with my dad. But he had a stroke in his 40s and was never in good enough health to do it with me. That and I was kind of shy and introverted so I never made friends to do it with either. It stinks to miss the memories but Im glad to hear you got to have them
Maybe you can look forward to using it as motivation to doing those sorts of things with your kids in the future if you choose to have them? 
Just try and drive carefully then. Maybe the weather will change by then
Fantastic was it a lot ?
Put it to some good use.
Do you feel better now.
Yeah. It happens to everyone whenever whether changes.
Have you been studying?
Good luck and Im sure if you prepared well and studied hard youll do great!
Thats no good what made you smoke?
Definitely maybe some exercise and relaxation instead?
Im an animal lover myself. I have a cat who just had four kittens. Theyre adorable!
Well thats very kind of you to help them out.
Thats terrifying are you okay?
Thankful that no one was hurt did you call the police?
Ah dang did he know you were trying to buy it also?
Well maybe you can set a deal up with him and you can share it!
well you can improvise and make everyday household items into a gym that work just a well!
yes. youtube will def have some awesome ideas . i could stand to get rid of this gut also..hahahah
Oh wow! That sounds scary! Id be mad!
How annoying! That sucks.
Oi...I dont like doctors or the dentists.
lol! I do not blame you did you look up reviews?
That is a stress we all go through! Its hard!
Oh no! You dont have family?
Aw I love puppers! What kind is it?
Aw Im happy for you they are really a joy and can make your life happier!
Oh nice! Tell me about the new school?
Oh thank goodness. That common core is ridiculous.
Fresh socks are a treat for the feet!
What does he do?
lol! My mom used to do that with books she would read the ending first.
Nope she still reads it all. Same thing you do silly! lol
Oh thats great! I got my cat a new bed and she wont touch it
Thats so nice of you to do that for her. I have two dogs and theyre picky too.
Aww I can see how that might make you feel really bad. Was it replaceable?
Thats a real bummer. On the bright side it taught your son that sometimes accidents happen and thats OK.
oh no! that is horrible and those things always seem to happen when on your way to work or somewhere important
wow that is a really expensive tire!!
Woohoo! That sounds like itll be a blast to drive!
Just make sure you drive safely! 
I bet that was exciting to watch
I am sure he got some things from you
Ah Im sorry well you can redeem your family and be a good influence to your community!
I bet youre a great person and dont worry about the past!
A good feeling about the weather?
Oh how neat!  I guess you must have sensed it!
Thats neat!  Where did you go?
Oh that sounds exciting!  Ive never had the chance to go to one.
Maybe she will go easy on you if this isnt something you do often. 
You shouldnt steal things especially non essential things like toys. But you probably know that.
Wow what did you do?
It is what I thought. You did good.
you should probably talk to that co worker and if it doesnt stop i would report it to the HR
I dont think you would make any problems. who knows maybe he is a pervert
I am sorry to hear that.  Hopefully at least he is making progress
Thats a wonderful thing to do. What kind of tasks do you do there?
Im sure they appreciate having people to talk to who dont judge them negatively. We have a little tent city in our neighborhood and it was just announced that theyre going to be removed. That makes me sad because there is a lack of shelters.
People think that people bring it on themselves so many have a hard time sympathizing.
Temporary teeth? How long do those last?
Ah yeah that was a pretty good idea then. Hopefully she can get some permanent ones soon!
Yikes. That is incredibly expensive for one tooth.
Awesome! Congratulations! Im sure you earned it.
Its good that they appreciate you and are kind enough to reward you for your efforts!
Youre gonna miss the launch. What are you doing on here?
Have you been playing for a long time?
Ive been playing since 2006.
I hate to hear that. Did the person that got the job deserve it?
Well I have faith that you will find something just as good keep your head up and keep trying.
Where are you going? Are you scared of going on the plane or going to a new place?
Im sure youll have a blast Ive heard its beautiful continent. And the food will be great!
Maybe if you search some more it will go on sale. But if you really like it you should get it.
Just think how happy it will make you feel each time you wear it.
Ohhh Ive been checking it out too!  What side are you going with?
Loktar ogar! I love my undead necromancer! What raceclass will you go with for Alliance?
Oh man. That sucks. NY is really fun. Why couldnt you go?
I would be kind of mad and dissappointed with him. You could have offered to pay your own way!
Thats pretty cool! Was it a professional game?
Sounds like hes a good player! You should ask him for some tickets!
Aw man. I am guessing you already went to the store. Did you have to interact with the manager?
Yeah that stinks. Is it a store you go often?
Congrats! I am also working hard at getting super fit too at 35! It is harder the older you are but totally doable if youre committed!
So true! Building muscle is great!
Oh no hes probably lost. Maybe you should take him in and feed him.
At least youre concerned and interested in helping. Some people would ignore the poor little kitty and just let him die. Very kind of you!
If I had a huge yard Id probably have an entire farm house from all the stray animals I see and feel bad for! I cant help myself.
Thats awesome. Would have been a bummer to come home to a messy house.
Well its good that you have such a great wife! I hope you guys have an amazing life together.
Congratulations Im sure you will do great.  its always nerveracking the first day of work!
Good luck and have fun.  The money will just be a bonus!
Whyd you turn her down?
Well props on you for being loyal. That shows a lot of character.
I did actually.
Im not even sure maybe they had a deal in place with the school board?
Sounds like a promising job
I know. I just went yesterday!
I cant wait to move and have a hook up.
Nice thats very convenient do you enjoy it? 
Haha she doesnt understand that youre at work!
Mmmm I love gourmet ice cream.  If I didnt have self control I would be like 800 pounds from it.
You and me both we need to hit the gym!
I love video games too whats your favorite. I really like Dont Starve by Klei.
Oooh my friends have been playing that maybe I should get it too
Oh no that must have been pretty awful. Do you not have self checkout at your grocery store?
If it makes you feel any better I bet that happens a lot to the cashier. They probably didnt think twice or care as long as you werent a jerk.
I deal with anxiety myself so I know not thinking about it is easier said than done. Take care of yourself and try to find a good distraction to get your mind off it!
How are they? Are you doing pretty well in that area?
That is awesome! Sounds like they are finely horned then! 
Fantastic! Being grateful is the way to be happy!
Me too! Its good when you have caring people around.
I love dogs what kind of puppy is it?
I have a pit myself they are great dogs despite what people say about them
Yea I enjoy stuff from my childhood. What kind of music are you listening to country rock something else?
That sounds like a really great time I love those nostalgic feelings you get from listening to stuff from your past.
I bet! Who do you think its going to have the most separation anxiety you or them? Be honest!
Well stay strong! For what its worth I moved schools a lot as a kid and yeah the first day is rough but kids adapt quickly. They might even make new friends right away!
Thats terrible that you are being abused. Who is treating you so poorly?
If you guys are in an exclusive relationship then that would be considered infidelity. You should leave her and focus on yourself.
Whats new in the game?
   Some people have no respect for otheres.
Are they like 1000 level classes?  If I was in a higher class Id of straight told them to quiet down.
Yeah youve still got some riff raff around at that level.  Man... its been a long time but I remember those days.
You should.  I ran out of patience for that stuff real fast.
Thats sick. Did you report them? They are supposed to have them cleaned several times per day or they can be shut down
I would as that is a serious health hazard
End of summer cleaning I know that feeling got to get ready for the school year!
Ah I can imagine Winters are brutal there I hear.
What do you have to speak on?
My knees get weak when I try to publicly speak its bad.
Thats nice what kind of shoes are they? Heels?
How fun! I love shoes I have at least 20 or 30 pairs in the house
Wow I hope you do get a nice bonus. Sounds like you work pretty hard.
Well Ill keep my fingers crossed for you.
That is so awesome. Congratulations. Any big plans to celebrate?
That is very exciting. 
Ugh that is so frustrating!
That is infuriating. I know how costly healthcare is. Such a shame that we as a country cant do better.
Oh god..I dont know how you military wives do it. I just cant imagine
I would be the same. I am a one person kind of gal. I dont do that even when I am single. The worry though must be hard!
That sounds so sweet.  What was the occasion?
I would be jealous of their strong love for one another.
Where are they headed?
Some free time to yourself! Maybe you can catch up on some guilty pleasures haha
lol! I bet how old are they?
Ohhh! Those times are nice. I only have a partner but I know I love my quiet mornings and my morning routine 
Aw thats cute how old is heshe?
Oh wow thats adorable.  Im sure its very fragile and cute wish I could see it!
That sucks do you plan on getting a new one?
You should my Ipad has great charge time.
Thats always a good feeling.  If you dont feel confident going in youre in trouble!
Ahhh Calculus I had a pretty hard time with that as well some how I got a B and to be honest I dont even know it.
Aww thats sad. I love any and all animals Im sorry
It can be tough losing a pet keep your head up
Are you going to keep them
That does sound very frustrating
Oh how did it go?
Oh nice what was the person like?
What movie did you end up watching?
Jennifer Lawrence is one of my favorite actors would you recommend it?
Oh nice! Where did you buy it?
Sounds like youre looking real sharp 
What does she like to eat?
Well that is step in the right direction at least
Im sorry to hear that. Were you close?
At least bonds that tight mean they will always be a part of you someway. 
It is nice to enjoy life 
I am glad you are happy its a great feeling to have
That is terrible I am sorry for your loss...
I understand that completely
Well I wish you the best of luck!
Thats awesome Im happy for you. What is she like?
Awh Im sorry to hear that. Do you have any friends at school? 
Well hopefully yall will still be able to keep in touch.
You must be so proud when did you find out?
Wow amazing! Do you enjoy motherhood?
Oh Im sorry to hear that. Did you tell her?
Mistakes happen. Im sure everyone has broken something that belongs to someone else at some point in their lives!
Awe.. Im sorry.   I know how you must feel. Ive got a dog myself.
Attleast the suffering is over.
Are you going to get another doggo?
Time heals all wounds.
You must be excited what kind of work will you do?
That is for sure but that should be cool how much does it cost?
That is not too bad I would do it for that
That must have been quite lonely.  How are you doing now?
That is good.  Hopefully things keep getting better in the future.
Congratulations! I hope you do its always nerveracking when it comes to the interview and whether or not your get it.
You got this! I have faith and sending positive vibes your way!
Why did you move into  that apartment complex then?
Yikes. Just dont go wantering around at night and keep your doors locke.d
Are you saying that a drunk guy hit your car and that it is very bad? If so that really sucks and I am sorry. Did he have insurance?
Were the police able to help? That sounds like a big mess!
Did you find anything interesting?
Good luck. When are they supposed to reply?
Oh wow thats great how do you like it so far?
Gosh thats too bad! Maybe continue to work there but looks apply for new jobs. Good Luck!
What might be wrong?
I hope everything comes back clean for you?
Im not too familiar with football who is their star player?
Interesting maybe Ill check them out this season
Who is coming?
Oh well that should be a lot of fun!

Careful. Lightning never strikes twice.
In any case good luck!
That is awesome enjoy the peace and quiet!
I am sure you have haha
How drunk was he?
Oh yeah I get it though you do not get paid to babysit
Was it an accident
It was just an accident. There will always be another tv

I cannot wait to sit on the porch with hot chocolate with the cool breeze coming through! Just a few more months!
Oh no did you get it back
Oh no I am sorry. Maybe he will come back
Did you have someone come in to spray it? You can ask for a refund maybe
Oh thats a good idea. What kind of bugs do you have?
I have been there. It can be irritating
Maybe you will get it next year

That most have been really nice. What did you do?
That sounds like it was a really good time!
Good for you!  I know that can be difficult but it will pay off in the end
Thats really something to be proud of.  Keep it up!
Congratulations. What a wonderful achievement. If I could do it all over again this is what Id want to do too.
Dont look back. Go forth and be brave.
what did you do with them?
ah thats always nice to do every once in a while.
Some jerk ding your car in the parking lot?
... and i bet they didnt even leave a note or anything.
It sounds like you had a really good time!
Its always a good place to be when you are content.
Those guys and girls tend to work hard
Its nice to find good work out there
Thats great! How did you do it?
Soda definitely can make you pack on some pounds! Keep up the healthy lifestyle!
I hope your okay! Do you think you have food poising?
Oh I see make sure to look at expriatian date next time 
Im so sorry to hear that its always tough to lose a pet. 
Oh wow that must be tough. Id like to think they were having trouble dealing with it themselves and thats why they didnt tell you right away.
What is in Asheville?
Oh that sounds very fun.
What kind of cereal was it
Well that sounds disgusting
That is horrible.  Is it still under warranty or anything like that?
That is a rip off honestly!  I dont think Id buy that brand again.
I can imagine you do. Do you have a needle fear? Even if you dont they still hurt
Oh wow I would be mad. Is there any other provider who could get you in faster? 
Congratulations on working up the nerve to fly! Did you enjoy the flight?
Thats awesome! Its always nice to overcome a fear!
 Are you going to ride roller coasters

im sorry he is no longer with you but at least you have great memories of him
did you get a suprise party?
oh yea thats always nice.
I bet you were but I am sure you had a good reason.
Thats too bad. I am sure your son understood though.
I have the same tub sitting in the attic. I have no idea what to do with all the photos! Are you creating collages or albums?
awwww I would probably cry too! Scanning them seems like it would take forever. Maybe see if there is a company you can send them to and theyll do it for you.
too hot outside?
yea yes that is a nice time of the year
Where were you coming from?...and how cheap was it?
Thats a steal.
what was it ? lightening perhaps
you must have some crystal clear windows 
Thats tough is there anyone else there that can help you?
Wow that sounds really physically demanding you must be quite strong.
Oh yuck! I hate flies. 
Haha what was the drink? 
Its never too late for some late summer cleaning!
Sounds like it.  Are you going to sleep better tonight knowing its clean?
Good to hear 
I love to play videogames. What did you play?
That is a very good game
How come? Do you not live with them anymore?
Wow thats awesome! Any special reason why?
Congratulations on that! Its a great feeling for sure.
I hope everything goes well but Im sure it will. Dont worry.
Well stress will cause more health problems just keep that in mind when you start to worry.
I hope it goes well are you sick?
Oh wow hopefully you can get some answers to ease your mind.
oh yea sounds like a great time of the year
go play bingo!
That is definitely scary. What happened next?
Thats funny I was thinking almost the same thing.
Its a shame that the present never seems capable of competing with the past.
What do you think about
Those are nice memories
Thats how many cups of coffee I had this morning! Did you have coffee too?
Oh yeah that does start next month! I guess I know what my husband will be doing on Sundays hahaha
Sounds like a plan I hope she is around for years to come
That is precious animals are something special that is for sure
Are you a big Eagles fan?
What is a lathe I am not familiar with it
Oh okay that is interesting I will need to look into that sounds awesome to me!
Are you a big eagles fan?
Haha! I lived in Alabama until recently so professional football is something Im distant from.
Theres nothing worse! What was wrong with it?
Did you take it to a shop?
Did you have to miss work?
Oh no that does sound so gross
Yeah it needs to be clean in there for sure
Ive never seen them. What do you love about them?
Hmm I may have to check them out then! 
Wow congrats to them. Are you worried you will loose your roommate? 
Can you afford it?
That sound like it was a bit rash.
Yeah but now theyre looking for him instead of the real crook.
i dont have kids  but i feel the same way u do if i had kids that is
thats the way it should be  they are the future
ah well at least you didnt feel lonely
Was anything missing?
Oh no are they okay
Its okay. Theres always Wednesday service or online sermons you can watch.
I wouldnt feel so bad about missing one day!
i dont know if i could make it thru a scary movie. it gets me too scared.
i cant imagine even trying to deal. you are braver than i am for sure.
I hope everything goes well for you.
Good luck and try to think about something else before then.
I have seen the previews. Is it good?
Murder can be interesting I guess
What were you expecting?
it almost rained on me when I was walking home today.
Thats unfortunate.  You must have been lonely.  Has your situation improved since then?
Wow.. thats... sad.
Can you go back and get it ?
Might be worth it rather than someone else picking it up.
WHAT did you catch them?
damn you should have hunted them down
It might have been the same person! We should stake out in the bushes out there and see who it was!
Well get Taco Bell and eat tacos all night and when we catch them well make them watch us eat the tacos and not share with them. 
Oh nice! What was the occasion?
Happy birthday! Did you have fun at your party?
Oh wow do you have a backup job lined up?
3rd time the charm?
Some people know they can do better so they shop around I guess.
I guess. Or it could be they are ready to move on but need to know someone else will be interested in them.
I would have screamed!
When a cockroach comes in my house the neighborhood knows it.
Oh yeah I can see how it could be lonely. Its so quiet when they are gone.
Yeah it is like an imbalance in the house somehow.
I dont do haunted houses lol
I would have dies
Are you proud of her?
What is she most talented at in school?
Never fun when someone tried to change your schedule. Lifes unfair sometimes.
Well hopefully you were able to get some overtime pay.
I hate it. I want it to be 100 and humid all the time. I thrive in the heat
Disconnect from what? Did you have a bad day?
Nice how much do you bench?
I see  how many years have you been playing footballwhat kind of goals do you have?
Thats so cool what is his name?
whats the dogs name ? what kind is it
oh those are nice loyal dogs.
What are they getting treatment for
I hope you guys get through it
Just say some prayers and be positive
What did they help them with just how to do certain moves?
Yes some are really good at helping others lose weight and feel good
That is very kind. Now many people like that.
You will have to return the favor sometime. 
Do you usually sleep in? I heard its better to wake up naturally.
Well maybe you will be able to start a new habit of waking up without it.
I sure do! What are some of your favorites?
Oh yeah those will do that. I still have like 40 of them on VCR or video cassette whatever those things were called. i doubt I would be able to find one these days that would actually play them
How did you guys end up meeting?
That makes sense when did you first meet up in person?
what did you see?
i hear that movie is great
That would be a dream
That is a place I have always wanted to go to
What happened to him ?
Was he in a dangerous area ?
thats great to hear im happy for you and your accomplishements 
hope your future is bright 
Thats great! Good for you!
That must feel really good. I bet your parents are proud!
What is her name you seem so lucky.
Oh thats always tough are you nervous?
I can understand if you try to think positively it might help
When will it be released? I have not heard of that one.
I am sure you will have a lot of fun when it comes out.
Have you checked your lease agreement they may be required by law to follow through.
Yeah I would show up at the office and show them exactly where they promised to take care of you. That should work.
Im sorry but Im so not a fan of meatloaf. Do you have a good recipe?
Hmm that might actually be good I think its the ketchup that I dont like about meatloaf. Bon appetit!
Did you sneak away from them?
who did she beat down?
oh lay the smack down     
yeah thats a bad habit. I dont like it either.
lol he is just like my brother. You should ignore him just like I ignore my borther
Thats impressive how did you do?
I dont think I could do it.
I keep forgetting that football season is right around the corner. Did you play when you were younger?
Spending time with your parents and watching games can create great memories! 
Wow... I kinda hope they get fired. Why did you need to talk to the landlord?
Are you okay with that
Have you talked to her about it
Awh Im sorry. What happened?
Well at least you know what to do next time. Im sure youll rock it then!
What church do you go to?
I havent been lately did you do a confession?
What hate did he get
Oh I do not like them
Thats awesome that you were so prepared!
I hope that you get rewarded for you hard work!
Oh no those are so gross
That is never a good thing
Thats so awful what is your dogs name?
what ended up happening
How long have you been working for the company?
I think you will do okay! Get as much rest as possible tonight just in case they do an interview!
That is indeed a bummer. Maybe you can pick some up on a ticket trading website?
Seriously. It ruins it for the real fans.
Maybe you should go somewhere else
Yeah you would think they would be good by now
i have never been to church  but i understand where your coming from
maybe one day ill go  its just the way i was brought up religion was not something my family made me follow 
That mustve been awful.
How old was she when she passed?
They really are. What is your favorite
Those are good too. I never saw that one
Ooh congratulations what for? 
Best of luck with that raise. Congrats to you!
i hope you enjoy art class that was always my favorite.
Oh no! Who is Matty?
Oh my.. I am so sorry. I hope you find her soon!
Do you live in a bad area or a big city?
Your safe in the woods. Most animals are more scared of you. What scared you?
If you have to leave just be very careful on the road.
Leave early and drive slower than normal. Just watch out for other drivers.
What kind of job is it
That sounds like a good one
What kind of animal is it?
Wow thats so cool those are a type of reptile right?
when does it come out? i wanna get that too and the new online service
ah that sounds about right
Yeah thats definitely not OK. Have you thought about contacting a tenants rights group to advocate on your behalf?
In some cases you can even legally withhold rent if they arent doing their duty as a landlord. Id definitely check out what you can do!
That sounds very dangerous
That would help a lot
Thats great. I bet he worked hard for it.
I am happy for him! It is always nice to see people reaching their goals.
i need to start playing too  that would be awesome
it would be a great life  hope you do eventually win
never seen it. dont like scary movies much
Im sorry to hear that! Whats stopping you from taking the trip?
Well hopefully you can make arrangements to take the trip another time. Its hard to find a new job!
I guess that means they were good at least
That sounds like a good idea
Are you looking forward to it or nah?
Well good. Then good luck tomorrow and knock em dead!
did he get you there?
You sound like a good person then. What kind of pet is it
That sounds very exotic
Thats good did you use one of those car buying services or something?
Did you end up getting a good deal?
Ill bet you were really glad when that flight was over!
Thats cool!  I love animals
I dont like spiders so much but I do really like snakes. 
I didnt understand. What happened?
I am sorry you had to hear that
I guess just pray about it and surround yourself with positive people
never seen it is it that scary?
ah maybe i need to check it out
What will you do next?
Have you found a house yet?
You have tornadoes?
Thats a good thing to have
Did she pass away?
Im sorry to hear that. Cancer is horrible. I cant wait till they find a cure.
Where did he end up flying too?
Thats a long trip do you have anything you can do to keep yourself occupied?
how is he doing?
well he has a good sibling!
Why did you miss it
Well you cant help that sometimes
Oh youre good then even beat up Camrys are great cars that last forever!
Its good to have supportive siblings like you
I am sure you did and I am sure he notices
Are you gojng to meet them again?
Good I wish you the best of luck with it may you find love!
I hate the dentist they poke and prod so much.
I had braces growing up too the worst part for me was the molding!
Like a stick shift car? You got some pretty rich friends!
Oh lol.  I hear those are expensive too so you got some rich friends! Lol
I bet that was a nice deal to find
I hope you have fun there then
were you able to make use of all the equipment
Wow thats great! She still has to pass the bar though right?
Wow thats impressive Im sure with that determination shell pass easily.
Thats the worst!  People need to be more considerate and clean up after their dogs
I agree completely.  People shouldnt have to watch every single step they take just to avoid stepping in it.
You actually stole them?
Well that was nice of you
It always scares me too when my power goes off. Ill nearly break my toe hitting it on walls and furniture trying to light a candle lol
oh thats sweet. did he like it?
wow that was mighty nice of you
Why were you upset
Oh well I wonder how he will pay for that then
Did you like it? I never liked it!
Yeah I agree those days will never come back!
Oh no!  Thats awful.  How did they manage that?
At least he apologized.  That makes it a little bit easier to deal with
Amen to that! Mine start wednesday and Friday!
the good ole days 
Ugh that is disgusting.  Im guessing it wasnt your own?
I bet.  It would be bad enough it was just spit but the tobacco amps it up to 11.  It would be nice if people had enough respect for others not to do that sort of stuff.
That should solve the problem!
Would you be making more money?
Well sometimes you have to spread your wings and leave the nest!
Its a good time to branch out then
There is nothing to be scared of
Has it been rainy there?
Its been the same way here just rain rain rain.
Ohh how did you get that?
ohh cool. I am happy for you
wow i did not see that coming.     on to the next one!
ohh nice. Where did you guys go?
Cool. I like classic italian pizza
Why did you feel ruined?
What did your leaders say about it?
I havent did you enjoy it?
Interesting maybe Ill check it out.
Man that really stinks. I hope that you are ok!
Oh no well at least you arent hurt
Do you want to get one now?
I assume your dad has passed?
Im sorry to hear that.  My parents are getting older... I dont even want to think about that yet.
Oh nice I never got into those games
Its OK we all get jealous sometimes. What did you envy about your best friend?
Dont sweat it! I am sure with hard work and determination you will land a good job too!
Oh wow! Have you been looking for it for a long time?
Well Im glad you found it! I know you had to be happy about that!
Those were the good old days. I wish I could go back to being that age even for just a day!
Did he buy 600 pizzas? lol
Thats good. I let my daughter go school shooping alon and she spent ten dollars on one shirt. I ended up buying everything myself
Way to go. You will be glad you did that in the future.
That market has been really lately so you should see it grow. 
Awesome! Have they upgraded it any or does it look the same?
Oh wow I bet it felt very nostalgic. Almost like being in a time machine.
How exciting. Kids grow up to fast.
My favorite sport. Is this his first year playing?
oh yea ? does it pay well
hah.. you get used to it.
Holy cow that IS impressive.  I cant believe people can eat that much.  Was he in a contest?
Ohhhh my goodness.  He deserves it for free if he can down 4 pounds of food.
Eww Ive had that happen. Did you say something to the person showing you the apartment?
Wow thats revolting. Id report it to the health department!
You are so lucky. They must bring you great joy.
That is amazing. I am sure they appreciate you too.
Wonderful!  It always feels so good to be prepared and ready to crush an interview.  I bet youll get the job because of that preparation and confidence.
Awesome!  Let me congratulate you ahead of time cause youve got this!  
im with you there
Oh no! Do you have any pets that could get out?
Thats terrible! Hopefully theyll come back home. Id be whooping somebody if I found out who did it!
Thats great. Do you think the rest of the week will be as great?
Lucky you. Are you always a positive person or its just been an amazing week really?
Oh yeah?  I hope you did well?
Are you excited to move out?
Where is the house located?
You must be really glad to have them.  Did they do something nice for you recentyl?
That is really great.  Hold on to those good friends.
Where would you like to vacation too?
That sounds amazing going to do some camping?
Did anything or anyone escape
Oh no did you get them back
what did you learn
Oh no I hate to hear that. What were they trying to sell?
Im sorry about that.
Yeah they always seem to grow up so fast. 
Yeah but just think. The best is yet to come!
What do you guys do for work together?
Thats awesome do you make enough to afford your payments?
Oh no!  Thats not your journey then.  Do you have other places you applied?
Im so sorry.  I know it must be tough right now but it is happening for a reason.  Make your dreams happen no matter where it is! 
Why did you cancel?
Oh that makes sense I am sure they understand
That is a beautiful thing
Really?  Are you scared by lots of movies?
Awwww... Thats cute.  
Oh I am sorry to hear that how old was it?
Oh well that is a long time but a stronger bond as well
Who left it open?
Did you complain to their customer service?
oh wow im sorry to hear that. glad to hear they got a good friend
i hope they get well
Are you serious? You dont deserve that.
Thats rough. Im sure you will be better in the long run. 
What songs were on it?
Oh baby that sounds like fun to me I loved old eminem.
Oh I am sorry to hear that
What is going so great?
Tell me about it.
Oh no! I hate when that happens! Did you turn off your alarm in your sleep?
It happens to me more than I like to admit lol
Its always nice to find clothes that fit well
Yeah if you find a brand you like stick with it
Have you won before?
Really? That is enough to retire if you know how to manage it!
you know what they say about chip kelly?
f chip kelly
Haha I know exactly what you mean! My uncle pranked his coworker once with a bag of sugar free candy. I feel for you seriously.
Oh man that is really bad. I feel sorry for laughing. 
Thats a great feeling I love mine as well.
Thats impressive she sounds amazing.
Oh no!  Are you itching all over now? 
Thats good.  I hope it gets better soon 
Where is it taking place?
Oh wow that is a huge life event then best of luck?
They are making another one? Those games were always so successful.
That is so cool. I might have to get a Switch.
yea that sucks.. feeling those cars zoom by you
well at least you lived to tell us about it!
What did you miss because of work?
Im sorry thats awful I bet hes sad.
That is awesome!  I know how hard it is to lose weight.  She  must be so happy.
I feel you.  Thats how my body functions too. Slow weight loss or not at all.  Its also dangerous to lose weight too quickly so dont wish it for yourself too fast.  Slowly and steadily keeps you from getting lose skin or gaining it all back too. 
I used to have the same problem Id always hear a bunch of spooky noises after everyone left.
I worked night shift alone in an office and Id always hear foot steps in the hallway 
That is very nice what movie did you see?
Oh really? Did you recover?
That is a scary feeling
Did you go to your mechanic for maintenance?
Did you report them to anyone
I am sorry you went through thaty
you should be!
What do you have planned for next weekend?
What does that mean?
Those things are gross
They are not normal animals for sure
Thats understandable companionship is great. Do you think you will seek one soon?
Yea definitely but only if you feel inclined.
I know what you mean! I got caught out in it by surprise totally ruined my bike ride.
Yeah lightning is no joke. Hopefully you have better weather this weekend and can get out!
Did they win their preseason game? 
Thats great if they quaterback is good and have a good defense they got it.
What do you have planned?
Thats going to be fun little catch and release?
Heck yeah thats awesome!  Did you celebrate with him
Did you pick up at least 95 of the tab? lol
have you gone to the doctor?
that sucks. i hope it turns out well for you
The week just started ha ha.  Do you have some fun plans?
Awesome my brotherinlaw does that.  He loves it.  Hope its beautiful weather for you!
oh thats cool what are you going to study
Were you in a bad part of town?
That is scary! You be careful!
Wow what a stroke of luck! Who did you such a solid?
Thats so very fortunate! There are still some kindhearted people out there after all.
Nothing feels worse than losing time to work when you should be free.
Hopefully they at least paid you overtime.
That is awesome too bad it will not be small forever!
What type of job are you applying for?
I bet you are but dont worry you got this!
Well you are supposed to tell me about something that made you feel a certain way.  Please share.
Thats great!  Having a job is a big deal  and Im sure it was a blessing after not having one for three years!!  Congrats to you!
i bet that was very nice sounds like a nice family you have i bet you are so happy
lol  she will get better 
I feel you have you tried setting a schedule or is it from lack of rest.
You may need a vacation or take a little break you dont want to overwork or wear your body down to much.
what kind of buisiness are you running?
hrmmm .. seems interesting. hopefully legal.
Is it a lizard?
Oh lord! Thats kind of scary
Thats interesting I have a tv by my couch as well. You have good taste.
Oh I didnt realize your brother had control of it because he slept there. Hopefully he finds another spot more comfy.
Were able to save any of it
It happens to all of us
Hopefully he is ok did they find anything wrong?
Thats pretty scary hopefully they can get him some meds and he gets to come home.
Thats so exciting! How did it go?
That is amazing! You must feel pretty proud of her.
oh wow i didnt even know they go for that long. i hope all goes well for you all!
well is he going back?
Oh no.  What happened?  Is your dog okay?
Oh no! Im so sorry!  I assume you dont have a Chip implanted to track it? Thats awful Id be furious!
Wow that would scare me too. What caused it?
Sorry to hear that youre in that situation. Hope you stay safe
Oh no! Is she stressed about something?
Ahh that could be it. Sometimes when my cat is stressed she poops or throws up.
Thats awesome. Maybe you have natural talent for it and should try to become a singer!
You could always post videos to social media in your spare time and see how well received it is. Many people have made it big starting out that way.
Oh nowhat happened?
That is so sad I hope you find him.
how long is grad school?
thats not bad good luck
Hey good for you!  Plenty of good boys and girls there?
Yeah but at least they get to see you often so you can give them some love and pets!
Thats awesome!  Keep up the good work my friend D
Thats so awesome!
Is it acting crazy or just not working?
You could name it Bob Marley since its always jammin lol I couldnt resist
Record it and have a Office Space moment with it lol
How did you meet them?
Its always nice to go somewhere you can meet a lot of new people.
I would be too were you in a shopping center?
People are so careless.
how old is he
I have never even heard of that movie but Im sure it would scare me.  I have never watched a horror movie in my life and I wont
Yeah I get scared easily by everyday things I dont need to help my imagination along.  What do you do to keep yourself from thinking about it?
What did you say
That is nasty but some people just do not care
I would love to play with you sometime.
What team is that?
Oh I am sorry to hear that 
What makes you say that?
I bet it felt really good to let that all out and to still be accepted by her.
did you give her stuff back
she knows it was you?
Good luck for this weekend.
That happened to me a couple months ago. It was a brand new tire which really sucked
Was there construction going on near your house? Someone had done work on my roof and I think maybe the nail in my tire came from there.
Well Happy Birthday!  Did you have a nice time?
Oh no!  I hope you feel better now and that you had a good time while you were on the trip at least.
I do. Why do you say that about her?
Thats terrible. Her kids are going to resent her.
Were you alone?
I dont blame you I would be scared too.  It seems like you got home alright though so that is good.
thats cool. what kind of car are you getting
I am so sorry to hear that. She might be hard to be around but I hope you spend some time with her.
wow. congratualations. do you think she is expecting it?
what is the plan?
Most people are dreading it. How come youre looking forward to it?
Oh yea! Congratulations!
What made you come to that decision I get angry when people leave carts close to others cars. 
Maybe it was a honest mistake then since she was elderly I see why you didnt want to give her up. 
Thats not good. Procrastination can lead to a lot of stress.
Hopefully she will learn quickly that its better to get her school work done quickly
Dang! Ask her out!
Alright alright you can go the slow route
That is amazing!  So many people do not stay married these days you should be proud of that accomplishment!
Its 100 for both of you!  It takes two to tango you know  Congrats on 35 years!
That is not fun.  Do the police have any leads?
That is a good thing.  Have you thought about getting a camera and posting that you have one on the property.
Oh no.  That is pretty bad.  Do you know who she is that you could go and leave her a tip? Mistakes happen and theres not much you can do.
Oh man thats terrible   Im so sorry. 
Yeah.  My grandmother was like that too.  The backbone of the family.  We all went our separate ways pretty much after she died.  Dont let that happen to your family!
Thats great to hear! Will you be in the ceremony?
Im so happy for you! I am sure it will be a wonderful day for both of you!
Ut oh.. what is your favorite?  I like so many I cant pick just one.
I havent tried that one yet  I will now.  I love blueberries.. and I like chex.
Why is he in the ICU?
Im sorry I hope he recovers!
What does that mean? A raise at work?
you should hook up with somebody then!!
it is not!! but you got to give it a try
That really stinks. You didnt go with them?
Ah. Well I suppose its a good thing you didnt know him. Less heartache for you I suppose.
Thats great how do you feel about it?
Congratulations then.  What kind of job is it?
Congratulations on that. You truly did it. Age is just a number. I hope you have your whole life ahead of you yet
it is almost over. Senior year is the final one and it will pass quickly. Been there done that
You will. Being prepared always helps
Thats right. I think you got it already. You know exactly what to do
That is true for some
If you love each other and stay close you will be fine.
I agree.  That happened to me and I had to stop watching them.  I worry too much about it happening to me or even worse my kids.
I know. Hearing statistics doesnt help either.  Crazy people doing things every 3 seconds.
Some men are such animals. Is she very attractive?
Dang that must have been difficult to clean up what did you eat after that?
Ramen ah you must be in college?
I bet that is kind of sad to see it go.
Where will the current students of that school go?
Thats nice to hear! Whats going on in your life?
So many people just want more and more. I think you got it right.
i hope it will come better and it will!!
you must have been very careful with the dod and donts!!
Oh no. Accidents happen. I feel really sorry for the dog.
Did you go back?
Dang that Sara!  Did you tell her how unhappy you were with her?
Yeah I understand.  Maybe you should pay her back somehow.
Put sugar in her salt shaker next time youre at her house D
LOL.  Good luck!  Glad you made it home safe 
Oh no...what did you do? 
Yes. I LOVE EGGPLANT! How could  you find that really gross? 
Hahaha well to each their own because I love how eggplant is mushy. 
Yeah and I dont think you can ever go wrong with deep fried food. Anything deep fried is delicious D 
Thats really good! Is he very smart?
I wish the best for your son. I am sure he will do well wherever he goes.
Are you confident you will pass?
Well you got this then
Everything happens for a reason
Right nothing can take that awy
I used to like watching scary movies. Not my thing anymore.
Maybe you can talk yourself out of it?
Thats a good way to think about it
Im sorry to hear that. Why did you miss seeing her?
aw no. Maybe you should tell her that so next time shell come when you have time?
I bet they will be a lot better I heard vegetarian helps a lot with that.
The only negative effect Ive read is the lack of protein but Im sure there are substitutes!
OH goodness!  Im glad you are ok what happened?
WOW!  That person needs to loose their license I believe  you are so blessed you were not hurt.
Congratulations!  Marriages take work but it is totally worth it when you have a good partner.  Did you do anything special for the anniversary?
Ive never been on one either but that sounds like so much fun.  Have a good time!
Why is he not asleep? 
He will learn with age.
In a school zone? thats not good
oh why!! do you guys support separate teams!!
poor him !! you should have bee angry or furious!!
What kind of cancer?
You gotta have some faith.
That is horrible but Ive been there myself.  Its hard to not be upset about it.
I know what you mean it is hard.  The only advice I have is that God is always there even when no one else is.
I miss my dad.. been so long.   What did you guys talk about?
my mom had Alzheimers.. it sucks!
Me either! Do you have any plans?
Thats sounds like a blast! Ive never been courageous enough to attempt that.
What prompted you to do that?  Did you tell someone and clear your conscience?
Best thing you can do is tell the truth and clear it up. Its not worth it and you only cheat yourself.  You can do it and youll feel better.
oh that so sad!! Did you try searching him everywhere!!
omg !! you would have been devastated!!
That is too bad. Are they okay?
Oh that is horrible! I cannot imagine what he must be going through!
How come? What year did you join?
Oh thats nice yeah its a good feature of Facebook
Cool. Are you in charge?
Sounds like a lot of work ahead
Im sorry you dont feel well is it a cold or something more serious?
I hope you feel better before this big meeting  or maybe you can reschedule it or something.
I love cruise I go on at least one every year.
Legs weak arms are heavy?
Thats great what job is it?
I have never met someone who has done that for a job.
Are you a birthday clown?
Wanna invest in a clown?
Do you feel bad for teasing him?
Yeah its funny how drastically people can change as they grow.
Did you get a chance to talk to them yet and introduce yourself?
Have you considered getting back at them by pranking them?
Thats so awesome!  Are they adopting domestically or abroad?  My husband and I tried to adopt from Japan but our paperwork expired before we could and then I got pregnant. I hope it goes well for them!
It will be so worth it when that child is in their arms!  Im so happy for them and the child they are saving!
What do you think you are going to do are you going to talk to him and find out?
Or you could find out he has a thing for you!  I hope either way that it works out for all of you.
Oh have you done this before?
Wow good luck sounds realy hard to me.
Hey thats amazing!!!  You dont see that often these days
You got that right!  Good job D   What do you all do these days?  Anything fun?
Nice!!!  Nothing better than getting money in the mail!
I am sure you are looking forward to it. What dont you like about it?
Sorry about your bad luck. Glad you are getting out of that place!
Will you be in trouble for not reinstating it?
I hope it works out for you.
Did anything get stolen?
Im glad they didnt run away.
Oh me. too.. Whats the craziest thing you remember happening?
Thats funny.  I never did anything that daring!
Awesome! What are your vacation plans?
Oh man Im jealous. Have fun and dont forget to wear sunscreen!
me too. I have three kids too
Are you serious?  Theres a noise ordinance for no loud noise or music after 1000p.m.!
You might have to call the cops just to get sleep! Horrible.  Sorry.
Im so sorry you are going through this.  Maybe it would be a good thing to get a therapist so that you have someone that can help you through it.
Well I hope you do find that special someone and that the stress at work lets up a bit as well.
Congratulations on that. That is a great life milestone for her. Is she planning on getting into a college?
Sounds great. I wish all the best in her future endeavors. 
Did it get worse or better?
Thats horrible you should set up an app that lets your family track you
You hvent taken anything yet?
That was very generous of you.
I hope so too. Theres nothing worse than someone you trust not repaying you.
oh yeah that really do grind!!
Aww thats awesome!  Did you take a day off and go through them for the memories???
Yeah Im so happy for you!  I need to go through some of my old stuff!!
Oh no! Were you upset about it ?
I am sorry that happened I would be upset too! 
That is very disrespectful especially since he is not in a standalone home.  Can you tell your landlord about it?
That is just crazy!  I hope he stops really soon  or you can figure out how to cut the power off on his side  LOL!
That is so exciting!  What torture waiting for a whole year!  Where are you going?
So fun!  Hope you have a great time!  
Cake always hits the spot when you have a sweet tooth. Was it from a birthday?
Moderation is key so you dont get sick!
Dang! Thats like a 13 year old gets an extra mozz stick and ska plays in his head!
I gotta go to McDonalds more often to cash in on these free nuggets!
Ewwwwwwwww! Was it a runny poop or a solid poop?
Yeah I would have totally done the same. Thats why I dont want a dog lol!
Oh I bet! Did you move far away?
Wow! Why did you move so far? 
I am so sorry. Did they give you another one for free?
I would feel they same way but that was nice of them! 
Why did you feel like you needed to steal candy?
Stealing very rarely is worth it that doesnt stop people from doing it.
LOL....Best thing to do when that happens is deny deny deny.
Smart move on your part. 
Did they hit you?
I know what you mean I would have been pissed! Probably would have gotten out and throat punched them if they had hit me!
What did she bring back?
Wow thats awful I had lice in school.
On social media?  or on the TV?
Ive never really watched youtube that much Im not sure what Id even watch on there.  But I know what you mean the content can be pretty despicable.
I did that too!  I remember it was a package of Big League Chew.  My mom took me back to the store and made me talk to the manager.  Did you have to do that as well?
Im not sure what 5 is but its a good story to tell your kids if you have any.  Ive told both of mine and they luckily have not done the same thing.
Have you found any good ones?
Nice! Its always good to sit around a tell the tales of your youth to our children 
WOW how amazing!  I love surprise parties.  Did you get a lot of good stuff?
That is awesome I mean the gifts are nice but its even better to know that youve got people that love and care about you.
Aw I am sorry to hear that. Is she still alive and well?
Awwwwww poor little doggie. I am sure she is chasing around mailmen happily in doggy heaven.
Did you nurse her back to health and get some weight on her?
I bet she was so tiny!  Im glad you found her and were able to take care of her.
Oh no it really sucks seeing someone you care about date someone who isnt good
I bet if you say anything about it youre the bad one too
Thats really rough man. Is there any way you can get her back?
I am sure youll find somebody in due time. It took me 6 years to find someone after my last relationship but it happened. Itll happen to you too!
Those good old times of fantasy. Kids world is so full of imagination and selfscaring created things
Here is an idea. Why dont you get yourself a teddy bear by your side when sleeping. He will protect you
Oh no!  How old is heshe?
Yeah I understand.  Is there anywhere you can take it to get it fixed?
Now why is it going to be scary? Going to a haunted house?
For what? Hallowscream at Busch Gardens?!?!? If so that place is a blast.
Oh no! That is one of my biggest fears!  What did you do?
I sure hope you get to keep your job.  I know it was a big accident but it was an accident.
Oh no I know that is so disappointing first hand.  The same thing has happened to me for the last three years.  Is everything going well though?
That is a real bummer.  Maybe you can have a makeup vacation in September.
I hope it went well!! she is alright now right?
thats just nice of you!! helping out your sister!!
Congrats! That is great news!
I bet! You deserve to be proud and excited though. You have worked hard for this.
Thats so scary! I hope your dog is OK.
I can imagine. Glad you are both alright.
Eh youll get there eventually. Besides big houses arent even that great! All you need is a moderate amount of space to live comfortably.
And thats the best part. Many of those folks with nice houses have mountains of debt. It causes a lot of stress.
Well since hes supposed to be IN the water you may have a fatality on your hands.
Yeah youd better find him like quick!  Or flood your house until you do  either way..
I love animals too. What are their names?
That is such a unique name I love it.
Ah thats so terrible. Did you find him?
i think it becomes a practice for him!!
Thats terrible. Did he get hurt?
Man I am truly sorry. If I knew you I would definitely help you out.
Oh no! Do you have any other work lined up?
I hope everything works out for you I know how hard shut downs can be. 
Thats so nice. Ive done that a few times and really enjoyed it
And youre doing something amazing!
Oh that is the worst.  It really puts you on edge.  What will happen if it doesnt come on time?
I really hope that it comes on time.  It can be so disappointing when something like that ruins your perfect plans.
Sorry to hear that. Have you tried to explain your side of things to your boss?
Hopefully this type of situation doesnt happen again. That really is disappointing how the system doesnt protect the employees about that type of situation.
That is funny what did she do?
That is amazing I guess she deserves to be spoon fed!
i hope you have many more
Ugh thats always the worst. I hope it wasnt something urgent you were waiting on?
Yeah Ive had them do that to me before too. Its a pain in the keester.
OMG...I know what you mean. I cant stand for anything to crawl on me or near me. Did you see any?
LOL....Their waiting for you to let your guard down and then they will attack you.
Oh my god! I have the heebiejeebies just thinking about it! Did it attack you?!?!
I am glad to hear you are alright. But I would still be on the look out for next time...they are the relatives of godzilla after all.
Wow you must be so proud!
I hope he keeps it up!
Im sorry thats quite disgusting.
That is a major issue.
Nice! I am glad to hear that you got to use your Baywatchesque skills!
Thats great man. You just have to wrestle a few sharks and theyll appoint you head lifeguard of the state.
I dont know if that is a good thing or a bad thing but either way it is EPIC.
It is hard to recover from a binge like that but do a few thousand situps and youll be good as new!
That really sucks. Did you make it up to your coworker?
Thats good to hear that you and your coworker mad amends. Live and learn!
Whoa! Did you have a strong craving or something?
Thats okay to give in sometimes and enjoy the moment. 
Oh that must be stressful. Do you think he is going to be fine?
All you must have been proud of yourself
Thats so terrible. How could they ditch you!!
That is pretty awesome was it something you really wanted?
You should write a good review sounds like they know what they are doing.
Thats kinda terrible. Did you apologize to him?
Well as long as you did and the wife doesnt know youre in the clear!
oh no thats teribble
he should do his work properly. He is such a naughty boy to do on the rug!!
Dang! I bet that feeling felt incredible! Did you guys celebrate?
Well thats kinda meh. But congratulations still!
That is awesome.  Is this for college?
You must be feeling great.  What are you studying?
I am an officer in the United States Navy but I agree with you. How about yourself?
I have sailed all over the glove. Hit a couple of countries in Europe a few scattered islands across the Atlantic. And the best part is Ive never been deployed! So I am truly living the dream that every sailor hopes for lol. I was very fortunate.
Awful. Im so sorry. Have you tried putting up posters?
No doubt he will when he gets cold and hungry. 
Thats great! What was it?
He will be rich one day!
That was rude of them. Did you beat their face in?
I would be too. Did you tell the manager?
Ah yes!  How did it make you feel?
Thats awesome!  Did it brighten your day?
Oooh free from what?
Wow thats awesome! To the beach?
Congratulations! Do you feel relieved to be done with school?
What did you study?
Awesome! So youd recommend it if I were looking for a new phone?
Ive never been a phone of Apple anyway. I had the first iPhone and wasnt impressed so I never tried again.
Great idea. Where are you planning on visiting?
Why dont you take them to Six Flags. It is more fun and full of exciting experiences rushed with adrenaline
Ooh thats exciting. What did he say? 
Wow thats amazing haha. So fancy. 
That must have been fun to go through and remember the good old days.
I love going through old memories and reliving the glory days.  Are you still friends with some of the folks you knew back then?
If you keep doing them youll look better!
Maybe you should go on a diet so you dont feel sick D
Yeah I wish I had a nice car too.
It would be nice to have money like that.
That was really nice of your neighbor. I wish i had one like that
Good you should be for having such a blesses neighbor
That is crazy!  Most kids first words are money.
Pretty savvy place! Were you working on your 1000 page manuscript for 10 hours squatting for free internet?
Thats great! I go there almost every single day and get a bread bowl!
I too feel your pain. I broke my diet by eating 4 dozen donuts in one sitting. 
Well get back on the horse together my friend. Skinnier days are ahead of us!
That sounds like a nice and relaxing day. What book were you enjoying?
Its really cool to have those moments where you get to enjoy what you like to do.
Woah how did you manage to eat 12 pizzas
oh oh. Its alright next time you should be bit careful not eat a lot
Oh man! A rookie mistake! Did your date notice the foul stench?
Well I guess it didnt turn out too bad. Are you guys going for another?
woah really nice!! what and all they did
you must have really enjoyed it
I know! Its terrible everywhere! And Im the only one who knows how to drive because I created the automobile!
Ugh. The horn is the worse! Especially those loud obnoxious semitruck horns!
Are you baking? What did you burn.
That is pretty unfortunate. You should be like me and just buy them always easier when someone else does the work.
Thats really gross. Did you say anything to him about it?
For sure. That really isnt something a normal person should be doing. Or anyone for that matter.
Wow that is really impressive!
They would be very jealous!
Three weeks to what?!?!?!?!?!?
Awesome!  Where are you going?
lol hey at least it was your neighbors sidewalk and not yours
Maybe you should find out who did it and go throw toilet paper all over their yard!!
Really? What was it that must of been pretty wild.
hmm that is a pretty epic first world. You would think that would be a little two difficult for a first word. The kid must be a genius
I hope too !! I think you will do well!!
omg!! millionaire that works at McDonalds. I would like to see you work 
Dang. Do you have the whole house to yourself?
Thats really rough. Maybe you should go to the gym and meet some friends?
That is funny. Dogs can be careless. You should take better care of it
You seem to be very fed up with him. How long have you had him?
It makes me feel the same. Thats why I voted for myself in the last election.
Truly unacceptable. We would be better off with chimpanzees in office.
That man is a winner if he kept it all down!
I am really amazed.  Was it you?
Im sorry that keeps happening to you.
I agree your talents would be better suited elsewhere. 
That is pretty unlucky. At lease it wasnt a power outage though.
Its like 100 degrees during the day you would have had to find a pool to jump in.
Thats terrible! Is it a festering wound that will turn you into a zombie?
Nonsense! If youre a zombie youll be brainless and the scar will be the least of your worries!
You must be really excited of the interview and i hope you will do well
You will nail it. Just be confident and just be yourself!!
That is so exciting! What did he say?
That is so cute! Be sure and jot that down in the baby book!
Dang thats rough. Are you set up for next month at least?
Thats great man. At least youll have a place to stay for the next month.
Thats so nice of them. Where did they find it?
thats a surprise and its after 5 long years
Thats terrible! Did you manage to find it?
That sucks man. Do you have another grandma who can give you a new one?
oh no!!Thats just terrible. did you made him to clean by himself!!
Naughty dog. he should look after himself
Really? Im thinking about buying one myself. What kind are you getting?
Nice. I have my eye on a Tesla.
Awesome do you think you are prepared for it?
Just take deep breaths and act confidently and youll do great!
That is indeed pretty gross. Perhaps you should help her clean it up?
I dont blame you but we have to help our struggling siblings out!
Im sorry to hear that thats got to be tough on you.
Mine died a couple years ago and I still think of her. 
What kind of website are you planning on designing?
Nice! Perhaps I can go buy a car on the website one day!
Holy cow thats amazing!  Thats awesome of you!!
Thats the coolest thing Ive heard all day
That is such a great age.  Is he doing well?
Hmmm. Have you asked to go over for a dip? He never said you couldnt come over and partake in the fun!
I am sure! Please let him know that I am game to come over for a pool party!
Ruh Roh! Did it come out of the rug easily?
Yeah thats never a good experience.  Coming home to that smell and mess ugh!
Wow thats awful. Why did he do that?
Im sorry to hear that. I hope he can get the help he needs.
You should get some bug spray. Flys are nasty
I once chased a fly around my room for 30 mins never caught it I think it was all in my head?
Same my friend! France played so well.
I do hope you rubbed it into your coworkers faces like I did!
ah happy birthday in advance to you. And whats the plan
They definitely will get you a rum cake
Used to be? What happened to it? Did it get closed down?
That sounds alarming. You better be careful next time visiting the place. They maybe careless with their sanitary responsibilities
That would get very irritating. Have you talked to her about it and let her know how you feel?
Thats too bad. I am sure it makes things very stressful and difficult.
Ah you are going to miss him
I feel sorry for you. I just hope you guys atleast meet now and then!!
Just be a good husband and you should be fine.
I have no idea. What happened?
Oh thank goodness you werent late.
Does it bother you when she does that?
It can really be annoying when someone tells you what to do.  Have you talked to her about it?
Did you just clean your place?
Mmmm I love that brownie smell.  Also nothing better than fresh brownies.
Only you can change that my friend!
Hey thats great!  You should take a before picture today and an after picture one month from now!
Thats terrible. Have you gone to a dentist to get it checked out?
I would be terrified too. You have to do get it checked out!
dont be !! you will do well. Just be yourself!!
That is not good I dont think iguanas can live out in the wild.
maybe you should lay out some bait he has to get hungry sometime.
That must be great!
He sounds like an excellent boss!
Oh no that is embarrassing.  Were you able to recover by the end?
I am so sorry that happened to you.  Will you get another crack at it sometime?
You must be very comfortable in your office! How did they react?
I am sorry that you now live in infamy. Maybe with time they can learn to forgive you.
Aw yeah! What year are you in college?
Just make sure you focus on getting good grades!
Aw I hate to hear that. I also hope she feels better. I love my dog so much.
I hope it all turns out well with good news there!
Thats amazing! Which word did he choose?
omgoodness! I dont think Ive even used flamingo in a sentence myself in a long time! Hes clearly a prodigy!
Thats pretty neat. Did you buy anything cool?
Thats so cool! Sounds like a store you would find in Daiagon Alley!
That must bring up scary memories.
Im sorry you didnt grow out of it.
Thats scary! Did you chase it away and show it whos boss?
I would have done the same. Never know if the thing is going to bite off your bellybutton or not.
Oh no! I hate when that happens! Does it still hurt?
Sorry to hear that! Definitely need to make sure it doesnt fall off!
I imagine that must have been quite a lonely experience for you. Did you see any ghosts?
Nice! What kind of pizza was it?
Thats awesome I bet she loves you just as much!
Aw thats adorable sounds like you guys will have a great life together!
Ewwww.  Maybe you should put them back in the oven for a bigt?
haha!  Did you just eat a bunch of mushy brownies?  
better hop on the elliptical for a little longer tomorrow!  Worth it!
Oh no thats awful. Maybe you can find something else to give her for her birthday but tell her you have another present that will arrive a little later. 
Thats awesome! What type of work will you be doing?
Hope you enjoy it!
Wow thats quite a feat. Did he get sick?
Yeah Id be tempted to barf myself witnessing that.
Oh thats great! What job is it?
She must be really smart!
That would be nerve racking but also fun I think.
Do you have a job lined up already?
Well you are ahead of the game more so than most people.
How nice of you to loan it out! Have to admit never heard of someone borrowing a lawn ornament though.
Im glad you gave him a chance to shine! Everyone deserves a chance to be trusted and its good on you to roll the dice!
Uh oh what did you do?
Ew that does sound gross.  Was it some sort of bet or thats all you had?
Aww thats awful.  Do you have to move like for a job or something?
Oh I bet.  Make sure to hang out with as many people as you can before you leave!
Nice how much was it worth?
Make sure to give your wife a big present when it is her birthday!
Oh yuck. Maybe it was expired then?
I hope you threw it out!
Oh what movie do you want to see?
That looks really exciting!
Yes and you didnt have to always buy items for the extra value menu.
Those are the good old days. Have to use coupons these days!
Oh that was so close.
Maybe you will win next time!
I remember my first city apartment the lights and sirens. It can be difficult.
I dont think they know about mufflers! You should try white noise and black out curtains.
Jeez. Was it audible? Smellable?
Whew I would be too. God knows if she messed herself.
I would do that to.
Yeah they should never find out.
From your house? do you have any idea who did it?
I would be furious they are expensive now a days!
They must have been quite good.
I hope you have better control next time.
Lucky! Last flat I had was on a gravel road in the middle of nowherelol.
My cell was out of range and it was dark out. My daughter was not happy. I am glad you got help.
Thats very admirable of you. It feels like no one takes care of family anymore.
I am sure with your care she will be much better off. I wish you and your family well.
I hope it isnt anything serious.
Hey thats sweet!  What for?
Ohh yeah!  That sounds awesome!  Is it a contest?
I am very proud of you!  Keep it up!
I wish I had your drive.
Is it for your work or part of any school projects you are having?
I admire engineering work. The true pioneers of societys good
garbage collection most important
all police not bad
Would she mind that? I wouldnt really mind that so much.
We all use a certain brand here. Now if you used my toothbrush that would be fighting actions!
Ah thats a pity. It really sucks to lose favorite shops.
Its like losing a family member... I hope you can find another shop like that someday.
What movie is it?
That looks like a fun movie!
What a way to wake up! Thats awful what happened?
Well I am sorry you had to witness that. Admittedly it 
You uttering this phrase i remembered the Peter Griffin Meme. So tell me what grinds your gears?
Why you guys dont you deliver a complain note to the management. They are responsible for handling the office tools
Oh no!  Why didnt you keep it in the attic or something?
Oh I see.  I bet it was a sad day then.
Is she a good driver?
I hope she is careful with it.
Congratulations is in an area that you are interested in?
Awesome Im happy for you good luck!
I am sorry. what happened to the cat?
I hope you have pet insurance you never know what can happen.
Haha Im with you.  Thats the worst it almost ruins the meal.
You could but its always a gamble!
I hope you get married!
ok carry on
That would make me angry and it is impossible to deal with in a drive thru.
I agree. I really hate driving off only to find out a third of your order is wrong or missing!
Good thing your boss was available. I would not worry about being embarrassed. Weve all done something dumb.
If he does then he isnt a very good person.
I would be pretty furious as well those can be expensive to get removed!
I agree some people just dont care about anyone but themselves. Its sad.
Im good. How about you?
That sounds quite scary.
Oh dear. Did they find out about it?
Maybe one day you could repay them?
Thats such a great feeling! Congratulations on all the hard work you put in paying off!
Then it sounds like you have two things going for you an A and some new found confidence!
That is awesome! Do you think you are prepared?
Well that sounds like you have prepared for sure! Hope all goes well!
Yikes! thats scary what did you do about it?
Good play I probably would of done the same haha.
That is so terrible!
You seem like a very good friend.
Thats gonna take some time. I love their designs but I hate the assembly!
Thats really cool. Have fun building the dresser!
Oh no! What had happened?
On the bright side you can buy a new vase to replace it!
Oh what did he make you?
He sounds like a fun kid!
Ah a plunger didnt do the trick? Hope it wasnt too expensive!
Yeah well at least it didnt break the bank things happen.
Oh that is sad. I hope you can spend some good time together then.
I hope you can also visit her there if you get the chance!
Thats awesome. I saved up for 4 months but then had a massive car repair bill..
I know. My advice is take it seriously just in case
Thats so frustrating! Do you know who it is?
Sorry to hear that. Maybe you and the other tenets can lobby for additional parking somehow?
Wow that must have made you feel so good about yourself.
Its such a great joy to win something. I hope your luck continues.
That could be kind of scary. Have you tried to meet anyone that might could show you around and then maybe you would not be so lonely?
Well maybe try meeting some new friends? Someone a little closer perhaps?
Good for you! It is really dangerous to do that.
Hopefully you can teach your friend to copy your behavior!
Was it The Meg?
I cant wait to see it now!
That is so messed up.
The world is not fair.
Nice. I love donuts. Are you going to go there as soon as they open?
I havent had any in a while but now I suddenly want some!
Yes I agree. I love to watch them do their routines on TV.
Something about watching the worlds best really keeps me interested.
Wow! How big was it? Did you smell it?
Yeah gotta be careful and give them their space
Yikes! That made a mess I bet. Did you get burned?
Yeah and it can stain. I drop my coffee more often than I am willing to admit.
Oh my god! That sounds terrifying
Just dont get too close! You never know what can trigger them
Me too Im excited for fall I like to layer my clothes
And the snow! Im excited to start skiing again
I would love to try them.
I really love snickerdoodles!
Dont be so hard on yourself. Some people are just naturals!
Singing is like any other skill. With time and practice I bet you can really tune those pipes!
You should put some time aside to study.
Thats a good start just stay motivated and focus on learning everything you can. You should pass the test easily.
By who? Who are you trying to get noticed by?
Oh thats so nice! Im sure youre a great coworker and employee
Thats nice to hear! Have you treated her to something special?
Always stay faithful it is the best thing for your relationship.
That must have been very humiliating.
oooh sorry that must have been embarrassing
take it easy did you find your way out?
Oh no! Was it a small local place?
Thats too bad small places are usually hidden gems for food
Ouch. I actually have done that before too though... 
Its embarrassing in the moment but I think there are more clumsy people all around us. 
jeez that sucks
what time is the trip
Oh that is just awful. Losing someone is so hard. 
Was he ill or was it sudden? Either way its still painful. 
That sounds scary. What made you feel unsafe?
I would have probably felt the same way as you. How did everything turn out?
Awesome! Have you been looking forward to it?
Great! I hope you have fun and remember it for a long time
Im sorry.  I hope you find it.
Where do you think it can be?
Oh no that sounds frustrating! I get road rage!
Yes! Whats even worse is when other people dont pay attention in bad traffic!
Wow that is impressive!
I wish your friend could teach my dog a few tricks!
Its good to hear! Are you alright now?
Fine. Have a joyful life ahead!
A hike in your package? Im sorry I dont follow. As in how long it would take to get there to you?
Ohh.. I see! Im sorry to hear that. Ive never had the personal experience of having to do so but sometimes people really have to argue and advocate for themselves to get the things they feel theyve earned and deserved like a salary raise. I hope in the future you can do that so that you can feel like youre getting what youve earned.
That sounds like it would be pretty gross.
Definitely Im not a super clean person but thats a bit far.
I hope you get a fresh start elsewhere!
Oh I understand mine is only 2 12 right now but I feel that way too when going through his preemie clothes. You probably feel it much more if they are grown though.
Yes! Do you keep your favorite things of theirs? I always keep my favorite outfits of his and donate the rest!
What a beautiful memory tho to have! Yeah a little weird but a little cool too! 
ha ha i understand its creepy but then again my mother kept her mothers glass eyeball so i guess nothing would surprise me anymore! 
Oh no! What kind of exam was it?
I bet! What are you going to school for?
Oh dont worry. Youll get good response. What was the email about?
Hope! youll get a good reply!
In his work? or life?
Give him some time. Im in counseling and its taken about a month for it to really help.
Thats good to hear. Being independent  all your life and then being cared for all the time can be a hard transition
Hopefully this will work out well for everyone involved.
Oh I hate when that happens. Did you make it on time?
That sucks. Why did you wake up late?
That sounds so fun. What great friends!
I am sure it was a great time!
Losing weight is the best feeling. I did that a couple of summers ago.. Its one of those few things where you can visibly see yourself getting better and theres not much that gives you as much pride as that. Congratulations!
I was proud of my mom when she started focusing more on her weight too just because of what you saidshes getting older. I wish she could live to 150 so anything that helps her live longer makes me really happy. Good for you for making that choice sooner rather than later.
There is always social security and part time jobs that seems to be the norm these days. A lot of old people do not have enough saved
I understand and i seriously think finance should be taught in school at a young age but the banks do not want that and will fight to keep that class out of schools
What place did you go to?
That makes sense but yeah human error is a very real thing which is why self driving cars would probably be an improvement
Glad to hear your life took a turn. Its always weird and even sometimes funny to look back on your life to see where you came from and how different and sometimes worse things were
Well its always so annoying in the beginning when you know you have to change but to see how much work there is to do in order to reach that change. Its hard for people to break things up into smaller pieces so its not so daunting. But congratulations to you for reaching a happier place
Wow! How often do you play the lottery?
Neat! Well that is a fantastic feat. Maybe you can win again sometime?
That is awesome. How was the rest of the show?
Whoa that sounds incredible. You are very lucky to have witnessed that.
Did they go away or did you break up?
Well remember that he is doing something healthy for himself and that should make your relationship stronger in the end.
Good mom or dad?
I hear you  My mom is like that. It means youre a great nurturer.
Oh man! Was it poisonous?
Hmm what state do you live in? Although I am in Michigan and we have poisonous ones here too. I didnt even realize in MID michigan we did until I almost stepped on one..I had a panic attack too lol
Oh man..TN has water mocassins I think Be careful!
Ah Im sorry to hear that. Were you really busy today then?
Oh yeah I know it. I have to work remote sometimes and depending on the mood loneliness hits hard.
Those sound super effective. I wish I had some of them here  I have never seen mosquitoes as bad as they are this year.
I will have to look into those they sound like a really good investment.
Oh thats disgusting! Have you tried to talk to them about it?
Oh my god! I would contact your city or DHEC. I bet if they started to get fined they would clean it up!
Ive wanted to play the switch for so long long I have heard such good things about it.  do you like it?
I think that is my problem with games I dont have the time
What did you fail at exactly?
I am sorry to hear that I hope you are able to succeed eventually!
Oh I see. Were they making fun of you guys?
yea i wouldnt touch that no matter how much they wanted to pay me heh
Do you normally have to work on weekends? What did you do? 
Sounds like fun glad you got to do enjoy yourself 
Gaah! Thats a state tax bill? Thats insane its hard enough already to open a business.
Jesus! I hate opening my mail already because its bills I cant imagine trying to do something that ambitious which in of itself is a lot of work to get a business started and you have to learn so many different things and then on top of it being sent stuff like that. Agghh! I hope it ends well for you though.
I cant imagine! I have a hard time sitting for long hours too. What are you looking in too?
Thats a job that is needed for sure. You could also try and get a degree in programming it usually only takes a year? So many things you can do. Also look into selling online. Its a great business if you stay on top of it daily 
Never heard of such a thing. Is it outdoors?
True is it a fun place too go?
Did they pick it back up?
Maybe they just dont notice it.
oh that is cool did it bring back some memories as well?
That sucks. Are there any cameras in the parking lot?
Some people have no integrity....
Oh? Did someone leave it open or did someone break in?
Oh no! I hope you find him
how many fingers have they lost?
now that is impressive
call the popo.
spray the hose in that direction to get the tv wet.
I would have been terrified! What did you do?
Oh poor thing!  What did you do?
Yay!  I had a little box turtle when I was younger I liked her a lot.  I hope Mrs. Lee has a long and happy and not thirsty  life with you!
What all do you have to get done?
Phew that sounds like a lot of work! You better start getting on that then!
It is scary yet exhilarating lol
Some dont like them. I cant do the ones that go straight down.
Oh wow congratulations! Im guessing you werent expecting?
Im so glad! When are you due?
Oh yeah why is that? Did the cops drag you out? 
hahah stripped sounded so much better but okay tripped! I gotcha 
Thats a big accomplishment. 
Next thing you know she will be walking. 
Weekends off are always great.  What did you do with your time?
Sounds fun.  I hope you had a good time!
Thats a lot of dedication. Was it for a special occasion? And have you been baking for very long or do you do it professionally at all?
Oh I feel terrible for both of you. Your hard work lost and she probably feels really guilty too for something that was maybe an accident. I hope you guys were able to talk it out and not get too upset with one another after a while.
As long as otherdays you are eating healthy I think its fine to cheat once in awhile
Just hit the gym as soon as you can and you will feel better!
Who hasnt that happened to before! If it took you that long to notice I bet no one else noticed. Were you able to fix it later?
Yeah I can understand how you would feel embarrassed there. It sounds like it didnt lead to anything too bad though so maybe most people dont remember it happened at this point.
I love the feeling a rollercoaster gives. Have you gone before?
Yes the juice is certainly worth the squeeze
Good for you! what are you planning to spend it on?
Enjoy it! You deserved it  I hope you will get more checks like that 
thats wonderful! I go to church every sabbath
i agree with you! I dont know what i would do without God. 
I am sure he has heard it before!
You were just in the moment I bet it wont happen again
A three pound burger?!? Thats crazy I could never eat one of those in one sitting.
Wow. I bet thats going to hurt him later though.
Did you travel for work or for vacation?
Its too soon to be homesick!
That is awesome. You sound confident.
Good for you. Good luck. Just remember to have a good time and you will be fine. 
Thats too bad. Do you mow a lot?
Absolutely. There are things far more important than lawn length.
And how does that make you feel?
What is she going to school for?
well what are some things that are bad from him
ohh i mean maybe you can go and give it a try and see how he does
Your company left you alone? In what way? That does sound like a troubling situation.
Oh I see. That makes a little more sense. Did everything work out or are they still gone?
What is your character?
Cool well have a good time theifing!
I just love Fall! Im guessing thats your favorite season?
I feel you. Watching the leaves change colors makes me feel peaceful.
awh that does sweet of you what kind of pet is it? 
ive always wanted one of those but to be honest i would be afraid lol 
where were they
oh that was nice
I know how you feel I can be lonely sometimes. 
I recommend taking some time to explore the city and find an hobby or interest and join some groups. It takes time to find a new set of friends.
Oh no! Im so sorry to hear that! 
Hopefully something similar will come up soon. Maybe you can check for another position in the company youre hoping for!
did you get it dismissed?
thats the law!
Maybe he was upset with you.
Then youd get in lots of trouble as most places have laws that your dog cant be on the loose
Whoa what a great surprise. Congratulations.
I am sure you deserve it. That is fantastic.
Long trip. How can you afford it?
Okay I get it. Ever seen the movie Hostel?
Is it physical? If you need anything let me know.
Does it work for good luck?
I understand. Is it a very nice watch?
did you make it ?
sounds like the start of a business
Thats wonderful. Always nice to take some time for the self especially with PTO.
Make sure to enjoy it to the fullest.
Yikes. Did you ever find the spider?
I think its time to invest in a can of bug spray
If you kno
Leaving family at home?
Behave on your vacation 
Thats so awesome! What a huge relief that must be. 
Keep focused! You can do it! Being debt free is an amazing feeling!
good memories ?
thats always good 
Did you have some special plans for the weekend that you couldnt go do? 
Well hopefully you can go soon 
what do you do ?
that sounds interesting
What is going on next week?
That is awesome. Kids here start tomorrow so I know the feeling of being ready for them to go!
I wouldnt want to do that.
Its just not worth it.
i agree with you there.
How nice of him!! you should be thankful to him!!
now how nice of you!! thats what  are friends for. I Hope you will get a job and your friend will get a gift!!
Very nice. I am sure you deserve it.
Good for you. Buy yourself something special.
I am sure it is a bittersweet moment.  I can relate myself.  It takes some getting used to
You will still have plenty of time before your son becomes an unruly teenager.  Cherish it.
Oh yeah thats couldnt have been good!
Most definitely! would you say you live in a good neighborhood?
Hey its a win win! You get the nice points and she gets her lunch! 
I bet she loves you for it either way! It doesnt matter how little the effort was it matters if it was nice! 
Ill bet it was! That must have been an enormous burger!
Haha! Id need a lot more than a free tshirt to eat a 3 pound burger!
did you beat her down ?
im sure it will make you feel better.
 I was late to an appointment recently because I got stuck in a traffic jam. 
Thats so annoying. Maybe you should leave earlier next time
What kind of prank did he pull on you?
Well what kind of prank was it?
how soon after did the beatdown come ?
thats what im talking about!
Did you talk to your boss?
Thats awful what did you want to do?
Thats such a shame. Could you perhaps join them for a couple of days?
Yeah. Oh to be a kid again and not have to deal with all that! So sorry youre going to miss time with your family. Hopefully theyll take lots of photos!
what ended up happening?
oh well good luck
Oh no did they leave a note?
What a jerk Im sorry that happened.
That sounds pretty awesome. How long until you get off from work?
hahaha hope you have fun!
Did someone give you a recipe or did you google it? Keep tasting it until you get what you want! 
As long as it has good reviews make sure you put a little squeeze of lime in it at the end. It really brings out the flavor. right before you serve it tho. 
I love ramen! not the healthiest food in the world but tastes good and hits the spot
my mom doesnt lol but she is crazy about healthy vegetarian food so 
Exciting is it hazardous scary or more excited scary?
Well go in with an open mind and maybe your experience will be different. And be sure you pay attention to the safety requirement!
Chemicals mean serious business but you landed the job. Good luck with doing well.
Ahhh i bet your nerves are thru the roof. Whens the test date? 
I wish you a lot of luck and try not to let it get the best of you  way easy to say... way hard to actually do. i know  
Have you asked the merchant why it is late?
I would be too! They should be more diligent with their shipping estimates!
What field are you in?
That is awesome I hope it goes well
Did you ever get cheated on?
Well that is good for you then!
Is Fall your favorite season?
Summer is my favorite because it means vacation!
Did you stop to help him?
Weve all been there...at least I have.
Oh wow is he flirting with her? Does he know she is a relationship with you?
I would defenitly just have her block the number so he gets the message. 
Nice! What will you be doing?
Nothing to be nervous about Im sure youll do fine!
i know i am really exited what do you have planned?
that is what i love the most about Thanksgiving the food is always the best
That is so awesome have you been accepted yet
I hope you do too! Applying is a huge step in the right direction!
Any damage to where you live ?
I hope you can get it all cleaned up without too much trouble.
Probably once or twice in my life but I dont go anywhere alone so...  
That is really crappy i think whatever makes you feel that way you should try to figure it out and battle it! You deserve to be happy all the time. 
That would be annoying.
That would be bothersome especially if its taking away from your time.
That is always fun to do.  What did you get yourself?
That is very cool.   I like tech that is practical but also fun to use.  
Do you know what their names will be?
Have you had any kids yet?
Oh thats wonderful twins seem really cool.
Congrats Ive heard that many twins have a special bond so I hope they have that and do well.
Yikes were you able to clean it up?
That sounds like it would do the trick. Hopefully his couch is okay.
What did you guys eat?
lol did you tell your friend about the hair?
What contest is that?
I hope you win!
Congratulations! Thats a very good job. What kind of food do you prepare?
Well they must think a lot of your abilities to promote you like that. I love Mexican food btw 
I love it when managers actually pay attention. Makes the job so much easier and more pleasant. Good for you.
No it wasnt you obviously. Your previous manager sounds like a control freak!
How long has it been since you have gotten a raise?
Did you talk to your manager?
Not worth the risk is it ?
Okay you know you can buy them too. And somebody lost for your gain.
Oh no! Is heshe okay? 
Blood makes me freak out too. That is pretty scary! Im glad they are okay.
Seriously?  What was going on?
Oh thats awful. I am glad you and your stuff is okay though!
That is such an exciting time and really nice of everyone to do that.
That also helps relieve some stress off of you trying to get everything ready by yourselves.
That sounds nice how long has it been
It will feel like old times for sure
Wow great! you must be so proud!
Of course  that is fantastic!  Congratue him from me.
Congratulations! You must be very proud of her. What kind of recital was it?
I bet! It takes quite a level of talent and composure to perform publicly like that. Kudos to your daughter!
Could you call people?
Yes meet new people!
that is lucky do you talk much in class?
well you probably should start paying much attetion if you dont want to risk it
Its good that you like it so much. Why are you worried that it will close?
Oh I understand. Maybe they make up for it on busy days like weekends.I hope they stay open so you can continue to enjoy their food.
Oh no did anyone see
Thats unfortunate I am sure they will forget
Im so sorry to hear that. Were you able to be there when she passed?
Sometimes you dont know when theyll pass unfortunately. I hope you take some time to grive.
How was the service?
Did you put any money in the collection pot?
Did you dig it out of the trash?
Did you cry yourself to sleep that night?
Thats a great surprise!
Thats really nice. I hope it was a big raise!
Im sorry to hear that? Is it a bad cold?
Thats good to hear. But kids can be a handful when they are sick.
I bet thats super awesome! Is it really comfortable? 
Oh man I would fall asleep in that
That is never a good feeling
Do you have some bills that you can put off until later?
Will you go again?
I can understand that for sure.
Sounds like a fun thing to do. What kind of racing did you see?
Oh Ive never seen that. It sounds amazing! If theyre anything like the F1 drivers theyll be incredible!
Yes! I love Halloween. I need to start making plans myself.
Thats awesome I hope he enjoys it too!
That was really nice of them! Im glad you got some help
Amazing! That had to be really stressful too though
that is not good do you have any idea why you spaced out
dont worry about it it happens to everyone it is nothing to be ashamed of
Are you one of the Uber drivers?
Did they apologize to you?
Thats a special moment. To hopefully see your kids doing better than you and all that jazz. Im in college but my parents live only a couple hours away so I just visit them instead since them coming to me wouldnt be anything too special. But congratulations to you and your kid
Thats awesome that he is helping to break the mold then. Says just as much about him as it does about you though. Takes good parenting to get him to that level of motivation
Its great to hear that youre in such good shape! I need to work on that myself.
Yeah I wasnt careful about what I ate when I was younger and Im really paying for it now. Hopefully they can get back in shape too.
That is a nice way to remember him. Its good that you have something of his to keep his memory alive.
Im sure thats an awesome feeling. 
Yeah dont be too hard on yourself for that. Were supposed to like that stuff.
I see. Youll find balance along the way though.
I used to be that way because I love holidays and the mood it puts everyone in. But Im starting to hate how short the fall and winter days are and how quickly it gets dark. Now that Ive been exercising outside more lately I hate losing that time in the sun
I can understand that. And I live in the south so it doesnt get that cold so I cant really complain. I visited my girlfriend who lives in the midwest last winter and it got under 0 at times. I could not live like that long term.
That must have been painful and a little embarrassing!
Probably they just fell bad for you thank god it was not worse.
Yikes. I live in the south and we dont get those. Just palmetto bugs flying roaches. I think Id rather have those than rats personally.
My girlfriend has complained about rats too since she lives in the midwest. Says shell be taking out the trash and shell hear them scurrying and it will freak her out. Good luck to you guys who have to deal with the little diseaseinfested things..
Im so proud of you! Thats a lot to deal with all at once! 
Its worth it! Itll teach you a lot that youll use later in life 
Thats very sad. My Grandma had that and it is devastating to experience it. Im told that doing puzzles etc. keeps the brain active and maybe at least delays it.
I really feel for you. Its not easy I wont kid you. But at least you understand whats happening and are obviously prepared for the inevitable.
I hear you there it can be more relaxing spending time at home thang going to a hectic party. 
Will your friend be disappointed with you?
I would be so excited! Im so proud of you! 
Hopefully you have some wine to celebrate with! 
thats annoying. maybe you should try giving them a call again?
i completely understand i hope they will call you soon so you wont have to
Oh. Do you have to buy a lot of presents or do you just not know what to buy?
I understand. You know there are websites were you can answer a few questions about the person you are buy a gift for and then it makes gift recommendations for that person.
Yeah I have tried it a few times. It suggests some pretty cool things too.
Oh wow! That usually doesnt happy usually that feeling fades with time. 
It sounds like you have a keep of a place to go!
Wow thats awesome. You must be feeling pretty content.
You did things right. You will be able to retire one day on your current track.
Thats pretty cool to hear. When I have kids I hope theyre the same and can get into sports since it offers so much. Good for you for getting them into sports
Itd be cool if she made it to the stage where she could play the World Cup.. I feel like thats such a cool sporting event and if you had your child in that thatd create some kind of family legacy.
Did you bring it in and take care of it?
Thats very kind of you. Too often people neglect stray animals and they suffer terrible short lives.
Did the neighbors come after you?
Maybe or at least recovered your basketball!
Tell him you had to go to the store!
How nice! Are you going out or are you going to have a nice night in?
Thats great. I hope you both enjoy yourselves.
Congratulations! I am sure you are very happy and beeming with pride right now. Whats the next step for her?
Excellent! Any scholarships in the future?
How scary!  I hope your neighbors are ok.
That is great at least there was something positive!
Awesome what kind of restaurant is it?
I love thai food I can see why it made you feel good!
Oh wow a wonderful surprise indeed!
Yes its always good to have family!
Thats really cool. Did it bring back good memories?
Im very sorry for your loss. Im glad you have the letter from him though.
I guarantee you know more than you think! Just be methodical and youll do just fine.
Everyone needs a math genius friend lol. At least you do if youre as hopeless at math as I am!
oh im so sorry you felt this way! I hope your mood will get better. maybe watch a good comedy?
i understand how you feel though. i would feel lonely but i would definitely do something fun like play video games or watch movie
Thats terrible.. Theres nothing more frustrating and deflating in life than unexpected expenses. I hope youre able to cover all of it. I know if I had one right now I might not be able to manage it.
I hope you can. If you think theres even a chance then give it a shot if it will save you that much money. My brother watches Youtube videos all the time of how to fix random things and it seems to work for him. If youre the type of person that can learn that way and if you have the patience then I think its a good thing to try.
What was she so negative?
What kind of dog is it?
Oh thats terrible getting delayed always annoys me
Oh yes that sounds a little dangerous I wouldnt take that flight unless it was necessary. 
That sounds so nice! I love to be with my dog outside too even if just watching him play.
Yes!v and a good exercise too!
thats great what did you have for lunch? i had some hot dogs and baked beans
i love chicken alfredo! so delicious. I wish i could nap too lol im a mom moms dont nap
How did you like it? Did it give an energy boost?
Wow so it definitely made a difference. I bet you will be drinking more then.
You know there is one thing that might make it even better.
Yea but have you ever experienced wings before?
I wish i could go to my old high school. i moved far from it but if i come back i will visit
i bet! High school was fun. We couldnt wait to become adults lol
Ewww. I hate it when dog owners dont pick up after their pets. We always carried a poop bag with us for when our pooch went.
No theyre not and its not just in this country. Europe is terrible for dog poo in the streets!
Thats amazing! he must really really love you.
Well atleast he did what he could to show you he cares.
Thats pretty gross. Were there other people around? Im always more nervous about that when people are around.
That sounds horrifying. Pretty sure I would die.
Haha oh no. Sometimes you need a cheat day.
Maybe next time have a huge meal before you start baking. That way you arent hungry. 
Its good to be confident. I am sure you will get some good news soon.
You did great. Just wait and dont stress about it.
Wow! Was your order important? Have you called the post office to find out what happened?
Well thats good. I hope her makes it before the end of the day and you get your package.
Awe! Hopefully they were cute pictures
Growing up sucks! Lmao
Congratulations! Its not easy moving to a new place but its great fun getting to know your new home!
That takes a lot of courage. Im proud of you! I moved last year and its both fun and scary at the same time
Did you wind up eating it?
lol you are such a nice person. I would have definately kicked that guy out!
Happy early birthday! Do you have any plans?
Thats a great plan. I hope your wife makes it happen!
That is terrifying did you get away from it?
That is good who knows if the dog has rabies or not. It would be unpleasant to get bit! 
Have you been expecting it long? 
Oh no!! I hope it comes soon. I know how that it to be waiting for money to come. 
You dont like to gossip at all?
I understadn that Others business is a very sensitive subject
Is this brother of yours a lot younger than you are?
Would you say your relationship is like the one in that movie Brother Bear?
What What tell me?
what were some of your favorites?
You must miss her. But Im sure shell be back before you know it!
She must like to travel. Have you ever gone with her?
Well thats disappointing. Maybe you can find a show similar to it to watch. 
I know what you mean. It seems they keep the crap shows going for years and the good ones get cancelled. 
Did you flip the bird? Some people are so rude.
You should also post the license plate on social media. Sometimes public shaming does wonders.
Well its a teachers goal to make sure his or her students succeed.  She wants you to do your best.
Its always good when you have a teacher who cares and puts forth the effort to help you as much as possible.
Must feel good to get it over with. How do you think you did?
That is great. You must have been very confident up there.
Yes! I bet it will did you go in and kill it?
What is the job will you like it?
Thats amazing I have actually had that happen to be before in my life I was so happy
Thats right taht makes me so happy to know
What did you fail?
How many times have you tried?
I almost feel like homework is counter productive. Shouldnt the schools be teaching the kids enough during their 8 hours?
I guess youre right. Education isnt something that can be rushed! But still I think homework is a little excessive.
Im sure therell be other games it will be useful for.
I built my own too a few years ago.
At times though I dont have as much time anymore.
Thats a shame do you have anything else lined up?
Therell probably be something else
Is that a bad thing?
Oh that cinnabon smell can be so enticing!
That sounds so good. I havent had one in forever.
Oh man! I would be so excited! When do you go?
Man thats going to be so awesome! 
Talk crap get smacked
Is this a true story
mcdonalds is honestly gross to me though rich or poor. i dont eat it.
Thatnks just a matter of preference I guess.
oh my god thats it so gross cat pee is the worst.
im so sorry  thats why im not the biggest fan of animals.
That sounds like quite a ride. Are you a fan of rollercoasters in general?
I understand that. I hate rollercoasters too.
That is great to hear. Anything new going on?
I wish I were so content. Must be a nice feeling.
Did it do much damage to your car ?
Well I hope they had insurance at least.
Dang that really blows. What was it made of glass?
They should use metal. That never breaks. Sorry that happened to you.
Did you get up to go check to see what it was?
Thats absoulty terrifying to be honest.
How long did it take? 
Doesnt sound too bad
Thats awesome. What band is it?
Never heard of it. I hope it was a good show!
Its hard for kids to do that. Maybe he was just bored?
Oh no I bet she ends up loving it!  Best of luck!
Oh nice!  What kind of phone did you get?
Think of all the mindless browsing you can do now!
Oh now thats exciting! Do you have any plans to do it? Celebrating with anyone?
Thats wonderful! Im happy for you. Hopefully he got you something meaningful sentimental and longlasting so that you can keep on enjoying it!
Honestly that will end up being a lot better in the long run anyway wont it? More memorable to know he really spent time and effort getting something for you.
oh man sorry to hear that. i mean good for your friend but i feel you. i never win anything
maybe one day we will win really big! who knows
a backed old man?
Hahaha yeah that kinda sucks
Thats really cool. What is your idea?
That sounds like a really cool idea. I hope that it turns out well!
That is really kind of you many people would not bother. I hope that she wins her battle.
Chemotherapy and radiation can really take their toll. There is a program through the cancer society that does a day of beauty with cancer patients. They give them a makeover giftbags wigs if needed.
That is excellent and you are a truly giving person. I wish her the best.
Id imagine it feels pretty nostalgic
Oh no! If it helps they probably dont remember. That stuff filters out faster than you would think!
Well I feel for ya! Im a very clumsy person myself trip all the time.
Im sure they understand. That is a tough position to be in.
Maybe try and reach out on social media to a few of them. Im sure they would love to hear from you.
Did he hurt the baby? Most of the time they are just curious 
Yeah thats what they do. Hahaha
Aww did you take it home with you? Its great to adopt strays.
Then I am sure the cat is yours. Enjoy your ball of fur!
I totally understand that feeling. Its very frustrating. All you can do is try your best and try not to pay too much attention to that aspect.
I think we all have our good days and bad days. Just keeping plugging along and I bet it gets better soon. It recently did for me.
I know how you feel. Keep your head up. Start putting out more applicaitons.
Oh that is the best. Did you buy anything?
Perfect. Must have been a nice surprise.
Do it! She may say yes!
Good! The sooner the better!
Wow thats really lucky of you.  Its good to find nice people out there
Good thing you found that guy and not someone else
Cool! There isnt anything like that around where I live
How did it go? Seeches can be intimidating
Weel thats good
Thats great you have such great friends!
Well he checks all of the boxes doesnt he!
Oh man thats a bummer.  Did you leave her or are you giving her another shot
Dang thats harsh homie...so sorry to hear that bud.  Dont worry as much as it hurts now she did you the favor of kicking herself out of your life...you deserve better than her 
A RAT! I would have died
You should get traps. You may have scared it away. I think only mice get scared though. Rats are like dinosaur mice
That is nice of you. I hope he appreciated it.
Well I am sure he will appreciate the effort even if it doesnt come out great. You are being thoughtful.
Thats sad. What happened?
Thats so bad. I dont have any pets
Oh I love vacations! Do you love the water?
Its beautiful Im sure youll have tons of fun.
You must be very proud. That is awesome.
Hopefully he keeps up. Im sure he has a great attitude.
That shows how lucky you can be!
Oh no! I hope that you were able to get someone to fix it!
Probably a good idea!
Oh no Im so sorry to hear that. My cat is getting old shes 15. Im scared shell pass soon too
Thats so sad. I hope you feel better soon. I would be so devastated too.
Sometimes it can be difficult to get your footing when starting out. It sounds like you enjoy your life now and have something to be proud of.
That is all that people can expect of you that you try to be the best you possible each and every day.
That really sucks Ive had that happen to me as well.
I agree most dont bother with something so simple like throwing away trash or returning grocery carts or holding open doors.
That really stinks. Maybe you should try and find something that your good at and do that!
What do you think you are really good?
Cool! Did you go to Greece for vacation?
Sounds awesome Ive never been to Europe
Thats awesome. I hope that it goes well!
Do you feel confident in you did on your finals?
I am so happy for you. Doe she make you feel special?
That is awesome. Everyone wishes to find someone like that.
What did he do to inspire such pride
Nice. That is pretty awesome
Wow thats really impressive.  Well I need to be open.  Flow to me money flow to me...
1 Billion come to me.  Im ready to recieve you
Oh that sounds great I hope you get it!
So exciting! Are you happy to move to a new job?
Maybe she will let you borrow it. Or maybe if she gets a new one she will give it to you.
Thats way too expensive for a bag. What is it made of gold? Haha.
You got an awesome girlfriend. Who are you going to see?
She sure surprised you. I hope you have a great time at the concert.
Whoa that is out there. Takes some real confidence to rock that.
Yea that is true. I hate that.
I know the feeling too. Im a 1000 miles from my family. 
Yeah same to you. Im counting down the days until I get to see them again. 
In 57 days according to my coutdown!
oh my goodness. that is crazy. ive never had anything like that happen.
thats amazing. what are you going to do with your amazing gift?
Oh yeah?  How did that go? 
Yep that happens lots of times but I dont think were supposed to talk about the elephant in the room per the instructions..
That sucks.  Did they give a reason?
Well maybe you can complain and get some money back or something?
Yikes you gotta pay more attention to your textbook maybe
I hope you do well and pass the exam!
Thats too bad. Maybe you can call them?
I hear you. Just think in the old days you would have to write letters lol.
Yikes thats really cruel of him to do that. Im sure youre trying the best you can
Dont mind them everyone has a tough time everynow and then. Youll be okay
Wow that is nice. What does he understand?
That is cool.
Who left all the dirty dishes?
Does she have a job?
Good for you have a beer for me!
Dang Im seriously about to go get one now you made me jealous.  Not even lying.
Its always good when a friend meets his potential
You got to stay focused and make that money. Dont want the world to pass you by
oh my goodness that is horrible. how come it didnt recognize you?
awww that is so sad. i hope it recognizes you after some time together.
Whats wrong? What are you visiting the doctor for?
Yes definitely get a blood test so you know what you need to watch out for
Oh no! before he got to have it?
Oh ok thats not as bad.  I thought it was before he got a chance to blow out the candles
Why did someone cancel on you?
Oh well itll come in soon enough you can look forward to it next weekend
What was high school like for you?
Oh thats awful. Im really sorry. So do the songs bring back bad memories?
Thats great! How far along is she?
Hahaha sounds like a great time you should prepare some games to play at the party
That is infuriating. I dont see how some people are so unaware.
I feel you. Some people just suck.
Oh nice. Any big plans for it?
Thats awesome. The beach is always a good time especially when the weather is nice!
Thats sad how old was your pet izzy
All iguanas go to heaven so Im sure he is
Well thats quite the accomplishment! How did you train her?
Aha of course the oldest operant conditioning trick in the book. I love it!
Sorry to hear that.  You get it fixed already or what
Its good to have reliable friends.
Awesome.  Sounds like you are defintely on top of the world today!
What kind of money we talking?  Lottery money?
Oh my! I hope that it goes well!
Im sure it will be ok. Its probably nothing. 
oh how exciting. what grade was it from?
that is so sweet. it would be fun if you have children so you can share it with them.
What is the longest you have been apart?
Yea that will be a little lonely for sure. Just try and stay productive as much as possible.
Wow that must be exciting. Do you have everything prepared?
Nice! Make sure to take lots of photos and make some cool memories together!
Whoa that is quite the confession. But you know its good that you recognize that you need to change a behavior. Very mature. Not everyone has that same ability to be honest with themselves and you should feel proud about that!
I know and I know it can be really hard to deal with that guilt. You want to solve the problem though and thats still worth something. Being able to take the little victories will go a long way toward the goal you want in terms of how you treat your husband.
Ive always gone by if you learned from your mistakes you have no reason to regret them
Its good youve grown and learned. Never stop 
Oh that is awful. I have been fired before it is just the worst. Have things gotten better since then?
It defintiely sounds bad.
That is good. Is it your manager who did the review?
i hate when that happens. my dreams are always so vivid they feel real.
oh my word. that is like a nightmare not a bad dream.
im so sorry you had to go thru that.
Oh no I hope everything goes well!
Well I hope that it all goes your way!
Do you live on a farm? It will probably be nice to move to a city and get away from those chickens.
What are you going to do with the chickens?
do you do it out of necessity or because of the thrill of it?
how about you get some of the same food for yourself?
I dont think that being bossy. You are just really concerned with getting a job done efficiently 
What games did you liked?
I like a lot COD. It is one of my favorites.
Just wear cologne dress sharp use mouthwash and let her do all the talking.  And youll be just fine
Thats good.  Just stay away from the beans and spicy food haha
That sounds awesome! I wish I could go!
That sounds like a really good time. It will be like you are a kid again!
Aw I am sorry to hear that. Im sure he was a good pet.
Oh wow. Pets can be just like family members. Its hard to lose them I know.
Why? What are you worried about?
Just try to relax and not worry so much. Yes something bad could happen but theres also a chance nothing goes wrong. Having anxiety about something can be hard to overcome but you can do it 
I loved playing that!  They look so outdated now.  Good times!
That must have been the most epic Christmas ever!  I think someone gave us ours but I cant remember.  Makes me want to play now!
Whoa congrats. You must be very excited.
That is so awesome. Im sure it will be a very fun day to share with everyone.
oh my goodness that is horrid. id think with hot water and degreaser.
haha. you are very welsome. thats what happens after years of dirty microwave cleaning.
Oh wow where are they?
Why are they in a  place so far away from you? Are you away at college?
Oh no! Im so sorry are you going to be alright?
Oh god Im so sorry for you! I hope everything goes well
I would be afraid one of them would get out!
Have you held any of your friends spiders?
That sounds like it could be a great success.  Do you both work well together?
I hope its a major triumph for you both!  
Nice how old are they
Nice you seem pretty open minded about so Im sure youll handle yourself well.
oh thats embarassing.  I hate it when that happens.   
haha well maybe they didnt want to embarass you.
Ew yeah it is not worth risking getting food poisoning!
Yes need to check those sell by dates. Meat may only be good for a few days afterwards.
Oh no! Have you already had some tests or is this the first time?
Im so sorry to hear. What is the problem?
Ah ok yeah my partner has had similar issues recently. I really hope it all works out for you!
That is so exciting how long do you have to wait tell you find out if you are accepted or not?
I am sure you have worked very hard to get to this place! 
That is great news!  I am sure he feels a great deal of accomplisment
I hope he enjoys his new job and can celebrate
That sounds so annoying!
I hope they finish up soon. That could drive someone crazy going on for so long.
Really? How come?
That is very disappointing. Maybe next time text or talk on the phone a little bit to see if you will have something in common.
Ah ok it is fine
Oh no! What do you think had happened or triggered it?
Hope she recovers and feels better overall soon. That can be quite the scare!
They are really impressive.  What circus was it?
Have you ever gotten to go to a Cirque du Soliel?  If you like acrobats you would love that!
I suggest a Night Owl surveillance system.
Thats the worst. I have that happen all the time but with onions.  Its the only thing they have to do so get it right!
Did you have them get you a new one plus give you your money back for having to taste that nastiness?
Why would you be worried? Do you have three arms?
Sounds to me like you need to build your selfconfidence a bit more.
how come. is their something wrong with it?
oh my goodness. is that not covered by the water company since its technically their meter?
I hope they come back with the desired result.  Good luck
Nice do you mind sharing what it was...my mom had a cyst in her ovaries but it ended up being benign
Oh I feel you! I have full control over my schedule it is so nice!
Part time self employed and part time just employed by a company. The company lets me choose my shifts though so... still full control.
oh wow that does suck! Hopefully you can push it to another day this week.
Defenitly and employers can be unreasonable sometimes.
Thats awesome what kind of car is it.
have you always wanted a jeep they seem pretty fun to drive.
Did the entire class laugh at you?
I havent peed my pants ever. Guess I am just lucky.
Why did your dog do it.
My Japanese spitz did that once...lady was waving a bone around and pulling back...til he caught her with one snap and almost bit her finger clean off
You must be a little jealous.  Maybe its time to save up for your own dream car?
I mean pros and cons... right?
Oh no!  That is disappointing.  Did you have to run out and get more?
Well I guess one night without beer is not going to kill you.  
Oh boy I hope you get some sleep tonight!
you got it bro!
Did you know all the answers?  I wouldnt be too good at it.
Wow impressive!  Id have to get some category like Kids or Nutrition to know much of anything. ha ha
That is awful those movies are pretty good minus the george clooney and ben afflack films.
You need to go see them and overcome your fear of bats
Im sorry to hear that hopefully you qualify for unemployment while you get back on your feet.
Are you in a right to work state? Here in my state they dont have to have a reason.
Oh no! I have the same problem at my work! How do you deal with it?
Yeah it can be hard. I resorted to wearing noise cancelling headphones myself!
Im sure itll go fine! Are you doing okay?
Im sorry to hear that. I hope the doctor can give you some treatment options. 
Now thats quite a gift! Are you going to take her to any games as a thank you?
Ive been looking forward to it starting too. Not a lot going on at the moment. But thats wonderful to hear!
What happens next.
Well I guess it worked itself out. 
I undersand. Do you want to strangle me?
That does sound scary.  I would have used my phone flashlight
brought back some old memories?
That was nice of you to help them.  What did you do to help?
Wow that sounds really complicated.  I could never do that.  Id send you a thank you card too
What talents do you speak of?
Thats pretty cool.   Do you go to the circus often?
Thats amazing to hear.  There is nothing like a great relationship!
Bad ones definatley make the good one a treasure.  Have you been together long?
That is a good long time!  I am sure you have many more ahead of you!
When you appreciate something that much its sure to continue that way!  Ive been married 19 years and love almost every minute!
Ah thats unfortunate. That can be really tough to remember sometimes. I know because Ive forgotten that too. But youll make it up as soon as you can Im sure!
As long as its not too delinquent and you have an otherwise good history of ontime payments you should be okay! Try talking to your loan servicer too. They can help.
Did they leave a note or anything?  I would be really upset too.  Were there any cameras that could have seen who did it?
Thats the worst.  I would feel so awful if I left a dent and fleed the scene of the crime.  Hopefully the guilt is eating away at that person.
I will try my best.
Well thats...kinda funny not gonna lie
haha well hey it happens to the best of us...I do it around my friends all the time
That is awesome. you must be very excited.
I bet. It will be great to have some time to unwind and not think about it.
What makes you unsure?
you should do a test drive and apply some math to the pay difference to decide if its worth it.
How fun! What kind of pet is it?
My kids want one of those but we have to wait until the youngest is old enough. So cute!
Aww! I bet that is so exciting! Do you want a girl or boy?
I hope it goes well. Children are great.
I am glad you grew out of your shell.
I was really neither.
Dang nice! Bugattis are freakin slick definitely a dream car...what does your friend do
Well that makes sense.  And Im sure you can do the same in good time just stay hungry and be about your paper!
Im sorry to hear that! It sounds like an honest mistake. 
Oh wow defenitly sounds like he was too focused on video games. Maybe talk to him about how it made you feel so you dont get resentful. 
Uh oh were you alone? Hopefully you didnt have to go very far! That can be super scary for sure.
Well thats just the worst. At least youre okay now! I dont know how you managed it.
Nice did you prepare well for it
Awesome good luck
Oh man thats rough... maybe you should think about moving?
I would have been so embarrassed! Hopefully you didnt get hurt at all
Could have been worse! 
did someone help you?
I hate working on the weekend.  Do you have to work this weekend
oh nice.  Thatll be fun.
oh my god that is so scary. what did you do?
that is awesome at least you didnt get hurt. thats what is important
That is annoying. Did you told your manager about it?
Why she doesnt want to do anything about it?
oh my god. i am so sorry. i have two sisters and know that pain.
that is horrible. i hope that your family can really cope thru this difficult time.
That is good I am sure your boss loves that.
You should talk to her about that.
Hahaha I dont mean to laugh but Im assuming he is young and kids are pretty funny.  Did anyone else see it happen?
Im sure the other people thought kids will be kids.  Hell learn eventually!
Now thats just not right! Weekends are supposed to be for relaxing and hanging out with friends not slaving away for the man! Hopefully you didnt have to cancel any plans...
Wow that really sucks Im sorry to hear that. You deserve to take yourself some vacation time or sick time or something.
You can do it you just need to start right away
Just putting away a little still helps
i always feel like im on top of the world after i workout. 
i must agree. even when i get spaghetti legs i must say its worth the rush that comes with it.
what project is that
Wow. Is he doing this for a show or a competition?
Terrible. So he is making himself unhealthy for a t shirt.
What kind would you get
Oh cute.  I have one.  SHe is the nicest dog
Did you discipline her?
Yeah that is always gross
why what happened
hopefully it works out for you
Lol! Ah Well cherish them while you can in the summers even though it can be tiring 
Well thats pretty annoying. Arent they supposed to have people there who do that for you?
If that happens again you should tell them they should have to pay you the appropriate wage to do work that theyre supposed to be doing themselves. Thats insane!
Sorry to hear that. What happens during your nightmare?
Well I hope you can find some peace from those dreams.
Great to have a daughter in basketball!
Well maybe you wont do it again.
That is good do you like to drink?
Do you plan to quit forever?
Me too sometime I had the same feeling about someone walking behind me.
oh thats a nice suprise
yea thats good they did
Oh who are they playing?
That will be so fun!
I love IKEA they have good meatballs.
Hopefully you can understand the instructions.
But its good that you made friends though right? Will you still be able to keep in touch with them?
Well then thats all the more reason to take more trips so you can see them! Maybe go on a couchsurfing tour of the world!
did you go ?
thats good keep going!
That was rude. Did they stop
Thats still tough to go through though
Good luck are you hoping for a boy or girl?
That is so exciting. 
it will be exciting. what will you be doing?
im sure you will do just fine. i hope that you will do well.
why didnt you go ?
That is a lot of meat.
Did they throw up after they finished?
rain storm or thunder storm?
weve had some pretty bad storms here too this year. it worries me too
Oh wow that sounds good to me
I like memories like that
what do you plan to do there
That does sound a little scary
It can be tough when friends have things that might be considered better than what you have.  Maybe it can be used as motivation
I am sure you are at least happy for your friend right?
I have done that. It happens to the best of us
I am sure no one really noticed
oh that was awkward
probably the best option
What kind of pet is it?
No way! They scare me  Is it easy?
Ready for what?
Great. What is the test about?
Thats not fair! what has he done that you havent done?
Thats so annoying.  Ive been in a similar situation. Just keep working hard. Youll get there one day
i cant say that i do
i highly doubt that
Thats nice! How are you gonna spend your weekend?
Oh man good luck! Hope you roll high.
Oh wow.  I hope shes still doing well!
Well good luck to her.  I know thats a tough thing to recover from.
That must be nice
Yeah I think we all wish that was possible
Oh wow. How long has your cousin been overseas?
Thats real nice of him. Do you miss him?
Have you used it yet
That is very smart
Oh damn. So whyd she pick you?
Spread of that magic my dude.
Nice nothing better than homemade mom lunches...what did she bring you
Stir fries are the bomb.
Thats awesome. i wish i still had mine.  I sold it a couple years ago
I wonder if there are any repair shops that could fix it
What happened? Are you ok?
I mean they could have just run your items instead of making you mad.
I bet you were anxious to know how you did! Did you study up with friends or family leading up to the drivers test?
Oh well thats a bit different of a situation lol. I gotcha! I didnt know you had to retake the test if you accidentally let it expire. But Im sure you did great!
Thats awesome! Im proud of you buddy.
Oh sweet. What number tattoo is it?
Thats pretty awesome. What is it gonna be of?
What did you cook
That sounds very good right now
Thats great to hear. Are you usually really busy?
Thats crazy. Well I hope you have an awesome weekend!
what kind of cake are you going to get ?
that does sound good
oh thats awesome
keep it up!
Woah!  Bet he was digesting for days!
That is amazing.  He should be on one of those food shows to see how much he can eat.
Oh no that is truly tragic. People dont appreciate the older novelties
You dont know what you got till its gone.. lol the ignorance!!!
I could be wrong...but I feel like they just miss your company...and are using your grandma as a scapegoat.  Dont be so hard on them theyre not always gonna be around 
You must have a good positive energy and thats what they miss.  I used to be the same.  But when theyre dead and gone youll miss the pestering so love them for who they are youre still free to make your own choices. Peace
Do you make them for a living or as a hobby?
Ive never even attempted something so huge. You must be very creative and precise. 
I hope you will be able to heal from this. 
wow how do you do it?
dang that sucks.. hopefully it pay well
Oh no. No one available to walk you part way or anything?
Did anything happen?
Sounds like a lot of fun! Im sure itll be a great date to bond.
Yes defenitly! Go on the ferris wheel and buy her some cotton candy 
Aw thats sweet. What kind of pet is it? Did you wish you could steal it so it could be yours instead?
Hmm I dont think Ive ever known anyone who has a bearded dragon before actually. Thats really cool though! Did you let the two of yalls bearded dragons ever interact?
Ah ah have fun.
That is so cool what was the project?
That is so awesome so it was a real life advanced battle bots.  So amazing.  Congratulations!
You must be so excited!
Wow thats awful but you know we all make dumb mistakes like that in desperate times.
That is so wonderful that you give your parents the credit and are so grateful for what they did for you!
I hope my kids say the same thing about me helping them that much when they grow up.
You must cook a lot of tasty food all the time!
hmm did you try calling pest control
yea thats true
i wish i could do that too
Yeah that does sound a little scary
Good for you. How did you know what that meant?
Very nice. I need to learn some new words.
That sounds awesome were are you going if you dont mind?
Nice! The summer is the perfect time for the beach.
I remember my wife saying that when she was pregnant with both of ours.  How far along are you?
That is a very long time.  Is this your first?
Ugh Ive been there before... What do they do?
Eeeewwww... some people have no shame
Thats great news to hear!
same thing happened to me.. i believe it 
they dont care about you unless you got tons of money in their back
is she coming back ?
oh yea .. well you can facetime or video chat in the meantime!
That would be awesome. What would you do with the winnings?
hahaha have you ever been to Hawaii?
Theyre checking you out or theyre glaring at you?
Ha ha!  Guess they like what they see! 
4 is still a baby for me...but id start treating him like a man
I love hondas.  Are you jealous of that person?
I know that feeling friend.
Is it for a special event?
I hope you are able to get it done in time  I love cheesecake so Im jealous I wont be there to eat it!
Oh god. Was it big?
Wow. Does it happen often then?
Thats awesome she sounds multi faceted.
Thats human when you live for a while you dont have to get stuff right the first time.
Oh yeah baby that sounds awesome. I dont know what it is but those buy in bulk stores food cafes always have INSANE pizza. Im jealous!
Believe me Ive eaten my fair share of it. My stepmom used to take me and my brother there when we were younger. Ill always have fond memories of it. But youre right I do need to go back and get some more sometime!
Wow that sounds exciting and anxietyinducing at the same time hope it turns out well for you.
Well its good you have some friendly support in case it goes poorly.
Oh wow. How many have they had now? lol
Oh not that much really.
Wow thats a huge step. Are you excited?
Im sure itll be amazing
Oh wow. Im impressed he can make furniture! Is he busy?
Awww give him some time. Im sure hell get to it eventually.
Oh no!  Did you overdraw your account?
Ugh its the worst. Ive had that happen a few times to me.  Like a punch to the gut.
Well you definitely deserve it then!
How much of a raise are you getting?
You sound like a very good friend!
I wish I had a friend like you.
I love ice cream cake did you enjoy it?
Its just cake there will always be another cake
I know what you mean no one can get to you like your mom. But they are awesome.
Oh yes to be raised by or spend as much time with their family. It sure is a crazy world.
Oh damn. Did you do something to upset your dog?
Oh no. Did something bad happen?
they got a ton of worker bees following their command
Im sorry to hear that. Will you get a day off soon?
Ill pray for ya! You need a break before you burn out.
I guess its an insect?
I guess you have to asks its creator
Oh I get you. Its been raining here everyday.
I hope you get some sun where you are too. Too much rain can get depressing.
Now that is one of the most unfortunate things Ive heard all week. How did you get it out of your hair? Eeww
That I think is a pretty justifiable response honestly lol. Now at the very least all youll have to do is clean the umbrella!
Wow. Thats pretty amazing. You have been through quite a lot in life.
Hopefully itll be smooth sailing from no onwards.
Oohh...if youre the girl thats ok...if youre a guy cmon buddy bring some cash lol
Tsk tsk gotta have a backup.  Nothing turns a girl off more than having to pay for everything...they like the feeling of security
How much is the jackpot?
That is a whole lot of money!
you were too good for them anyway!
im sure you will do great where ever you end up going
You must be a great student!
I wish you more success in your education.
Yikes. Why did you take it may I ask?
Ah well if you havent sold it yet theres still time to return it!
where were you all going to go ?
oh that sounds like fun
I feel like I have heard that a lot tonight
Why are you surprised she asked you out? 
A lot of girls dont follow the traditional ways anymore.
It is kind of odd to look at ourselves from that long ago and we didnt even realize what we looked like usually at that time.
Its like youre looking at someone else almost.
Why did they cancel
I guess work does that sometimes
Impressive! It is all going to be well worth it in the long run keep going ghost rider!
If theres a will then theres a way! Er in most situations were not talking about you trying to do brain surgery tomorrow or anything. 
Haha. That would have scared me so much.
You never know with those cats. They are very sly.
Oh I hope it does! I bet youve got a super secret ingredient that makes it stand out from the rest of the rabble.
Then it will be appropriate if it pays off for you. If you win first prize Im gonna need you to start getting it put in grocery stores so I can buy some!
what does she say ?
oh no. this sounds bad.
Im so sorry to hear that. Have you tried calling your local shelther or animal control?
Oh sometimes you just have to accept weather changing your plans. I am sure you can go another time.
Thats a bummer. Well I hope you can find another weekend to make up for it.
wow. a cruise sounds pretty amazing. where to?
Oh man. Youll get to spend time with the family too. thats whats up.
I know right!  Asian food is pricey.
Wow! Thats pretty amazing. How are you gonna spend it?
hahaha still in shock hu? Well as long as its the good of shock. 
Do you think that if you apologized they would forgive you?
Why did you do that
I understand people do it all of the time
why ? im sure you will be fine
Were you able to find your dog?
Oh damn. Me too. What area are you in?
Northeast here. Must be raining all along the coast.
Are you happy with that
I guess it was just meant to be then
Omg that is awful. How long did it take to recover? 
I bet! I am glad it wasnt even for serious than it was already.
I know I cant wait either!
I am rooting for the Longhorns!
I guess people are way more rude these days arent they
I do miss that as well maybe it will come back
Oh thats got to feel rough. Its not quite the same but Ive felt similarly when I couldnt get previous exgirlfriends gifts during holidays or their birthdays or something. But Im sure she knows you love her anyway.
It does. Feeling bad about it is enough to show you care about her which is something paradoxically to feel good about I think. Just keep being a good dad to her. 
That is great. How old is she?
At this age they are cute.
You couldnt say no to working?
That is a real bummer.  Im sorry that happened to you.  Will you be able to reschedule your plans?
I am sorry it didnt work out. But happy to hear you are happy now.
That is so wonderful because that doesnt normally happen.
That must be annoying!
I hope that gets resolved soon.
Yikes. Mine was 210.
Turn the AC up a little 
It looks good. Should I save my money?
I thought the name was dumb too but the previews looked awesome. Is it scary at all because I dont llike anthing remotel scary
That sounds soooo good! Im eating lowcarb right now but Im a pushover for good mashed potatoes!
LOL!  Ive done things like that before also sometimes you just need some me time with some good food ya know?
Oh no I hate when that happens
Good luck lots of coffee!
I think it is that might make you feel better
Its the perfect time to go see them then
That is tough. Was it a big lie?
You must be feeling pretty guilty. That sucks. 
What kind of test was it
I am sure you will do better next time
Oh gross! That must have been disgusting to see.
Wow I can only imagine what other gross things she does.
Is that a video game?  Is it Mario?
I used to LOVE Mario Kart  Im not a big video game fan but I loved that one.  I can see why you are excited about it coming out!
What exactly did you see?
Wow thats very annoying he should be arrested.
Wow how amazing is that!? I wish someone would do that for me! I mean I dont think I buy more than 30 of groceries at a time since its just me but still!
Thats a wonderful idea I love that! And you know if you find you cant quite do the exact same thing for someone else you can always donate food to a food bank or something. Its the exact same thing and itll make you feel awesome.
Oh that sucks! Maybe you can go the next day.
Do you normally go very often?
oh wow! that is horrible!! did they get away with it?
i am sorry to hear that. that is a bad incident to have happen on vacation
That is so exciting.  Is this your first?
I guess you have a plan to induce labor or a scheduled Csection?
Oh Do you think you did something wrong? 
Thats terrible I wouldnt like for that to happen to me.
Where did you go and what happened?
Thats too bad did you get to the second place after?
What are they coming to fix?
Oh my my hope it gets fixed fast
Woohooo... I bet youre ecstatic
I cant wait until my daughter is old enough to go to school lol 
I know how that feels. Its a good feeling to be on the right path finally
That sounds like a neat tradition. What did you guys do with the apples once they were all picked?
Sounds like a bunch of tasty items! My mom used to make a banging apple pie whenever I came home for Thanksgiving. It was the best feeling in the world eating it.
That is amazing!  Im so happy for you!  What kind of car did they get you?
Hey a new car is a new car!  Im dying from heat in my car since the AC broke.  Have fun driving!
Thats awesome! How long do you think it will take you to build it?
Is this the first time youve put a computer together?
Ah I know that feeling well. My family moved around a ton while I was in grade school so I dont really have many long term friends. Dont worry though youll make friends at your new job so easily you wont even remember you didnt have friends!
I mean yeah it cant hurt can it? Im sure theyll be excited to meet you and get to know you as much as vice versa. Plus who knows? Your new best friend might be in there for all you know!
That bad huh? what was wrong withem
They? you went on a date with more than one person??
That can be a scary thing to see
I like cats but not those kind of cats
That does sound lonely. Do you have friends to turn to?
Well thats good. If you can find a hobby to occupy those evenings that would be best.
Oh no!  Are you hurt?  Dont even worry about them. It happens to the best of us.
Im glad youre okay.  It is so embarrassing.  Ive done that before but at least you got back up!  Pride can heal and a body takes longer to! 
I bet! I am still too scared to ride one.
Maybe I should get over my fear and finally ride one.
Thats really sweet of him. How long have you been friends?
What do you guys like to do for fun?
Aw thats too bad. What kind of restaurant was it?
Dang what I would do for some sweet chinese now. Did you find one to replace it?
Im sorry to hear that. Adolph mustve had a happy life though.
Man. What was it like having a armadillo as a pet?
Thats really sad. Were you close to him?
I am sorry to hear that. I was pretty distraught when I lost my granddad as well. May he rest in peace.
It sounds like a big opportunity for you.  Are you ready for it?
Good luck Im sure you will do well.
What in the world. Are they doing drugs?
Omg I would be videoing it for sure lol
Whats your favorite Mexican sweet?
I have never had any either. I hope you enjoy them!
Thats pretty nice! I havent been skating in a coons age. Is the rink nice?
Thats great! I may look it up and go to their grand opening as well.
Oh youve definitely done your part to prepare. Good luck!
What is the position for?
I love reminiscing like that I hope they were all good memories!
Im glad!  Its funny how we can look back and be able to remember the good times!
That seems really nice actually. I do have a few close female friends.
You must really trust these people. Yall must have been friends for a long time.
On no! Did you report it?
Was it a really expensive one?
Thats awesome Its nice to have friends that are role models
Hard work is always rewarded!
Thats great. Where are yall from?
I visited once there. The people are very nice.
Why does that bother you?
Sometimes thats the best option.
ah thats so bad!! did you fix it yet?
you would be irritated for couple of days then 
Well dang man. Its never too late! Just hit her up on the ole Facebook!
I am sure you two will be having babies in no time if you hit her up right this instant!
awww sorry bout your rug...theres a facebook group called doggo you should follow...owners post pics of their dogs with signs around their necks like I like jumping out of moving cars just to poop in front of strangers you might be less mad looking at them haha
Yup.  But heres a link httpswww.facebook.comdoggocomphotospcb.511713622609187511711852609364?type3theater
what does that mean?
OH like a raise? If you worked hard they should give it to you
oh how did you miss that?
ah thats so bad!!. You are right in this age we need to get rid of this written checks
Oh what happened? Did your car break down?
Ohh I feel bad for you. I am sure everything going to be alright.
I havent but I am familiar with it.
What team does he play for?
Thats really great to hear. Its always good to prepare for big events like that. Whats the meeting about?
I am sure youre going to crush it into the ground.
That is great to hear. Are you good at math?
I hope you do well then
Right sometimes I feel the same way when I feel like I should have something but then I realize I would get bored from it after a while like everything
Yeah and its just one more thing you have to keep track of
Ohh. Good for him. Some guys are born lucky
Ohh dont feel bad. I am sure someday you will get one.
You are so brave to do that!
Your dog is very lucky!
ive had one dogg that I love but since she did its been hard to love again.
yeah she was an older family dog.
Engaging in conversation whether the spoken or written word helps to further communication along.
You are doing a great job ! You are following our conversation naturally.
Did he at least take you out to lunch with the winnings?
Maybe you will win next time.
I cant imagine seeing one in real life. I would be so scared.
I dont think I could go anywhere where they may be. Its terrifying to think about.
I agree. That is rude and annoying. How do you handle it?
I generally tend to start walking away from them.
Holy cow! I think I would have passed out if I was you!
Oh wow You probably shouldnt be drinking and driving tho.
I am sure that makes you feel bad have you talked to them about how you feel?
That is a sticky situation to be in
Oh Im glad you got it! Did someone call out for you?
You had that instinct. 
I would be happy too if I had that. What kind of cat do you have?
Aw well its good that you guys took him in. Youre a kind sould.
I think some kids go through that. Did your parents comfort you?
Oh no. Did you get much sleep as a kid at all?
Oh god. That must be terrifying.
Oh lord. Theyre still there?
That sounds very fortunate. Good timing.
Pets are amazing in that way. Glad he was there for you when you needed it.
Boy what I would do for a slice o that right now. What kind of pizza is it?
Dang I bet thatll be better than that racist Papa Johns pizza!
Oh god. Well at least it died nice and full.
Im sure it was! Kinda feel bad for it.
That sounds exciting! The seminar will be a great time to connect with your bosses
Great! Im so happy that your hard work was worth it!
Oh really cat does like that?
ah thats horrible. Did you take her to the doctors?
Oh man. Did you get a chance to say goodbye?
hm mustve been a big goldfish.
Thats pretty cool. Maybe you could toss me a few recipes for recently deceased goldfish?
No no! I swear I dont! I meant the cracker goldfish! The crackers!!!
On no! Did you get hurt?
I bet! I would be too! I am so sorry that happened to you.
Thats exciting! I have no idea how that sport is even played but Im glad you go to go see it! Did the team you were rooting for win?
I will definitely be on the lookout for it. That is awesome though you were supporting your team! You may have been all by yourself but you were the only one getting to celebrate! Hell yeah brother!
Well you can call her today and make up for it?
Wow how did that happen?? 
Well Im sure you figured out your mistake right away!
You should do it.  I think youll do great.
Where are you going to go on your first date?
Im so sorry to hear that. Why did it happen?
Yea. So you didnt get that warning not to date crazy hu?
Oh gross did you spit it back out?
Oh no! Im so sorry to hear that. Maybe its not that bad? just drink a lot of water
Thats terrible my friend. Is there a chance to get it in the near future?
I am sure you will. Just gotta keep kicking butt and taking names!
Ugh I hate that!  What are they doing to irritate you?
Thats horrible  can you complain the complex or HOA?   Or figure out a way to cut their power is always an option?
Thats going to take forever
Aw. I do that too. I still have my old cell phones with videos of mt babies doing nothing lol
hm is there a reason you are going? have you been experiencing chronic pain?
That sucks. I hope it helps!
Pets are great companions.  Mine follow me around everywhere and I am sure you cat does the same thing
Animals are pretty intuitive.  That are great at picking up peoples moods I have found
Oh yeah? Was it any good?
Oh I see. What made you finally decide to try it out?
well that is def a big decision to consider
it is a life changer for sure. it will change the everyday activities in your life
Thats exciting! What car did you get?
Great car! I love Subarus my favorite is the impreza with turbo
Aw thats so sweet. Why would you say such a thing?
Sounds like a great girlfriend. I am sure she will be around for whenever you need her like you did last week.
Oh sounds exciting! Howd it go
I should try it one day! Were you afraid of heights?
Oh what was it about? Was it for an event?
That sounds like a touching moment. How wonderful for you!
Ohh thats bad. How did you feel?
Ohh I am so sorry. That ones my favorite too! But I feel bad for you.
I am sure you had a really good reason right?
Oh wow I hope you get some help soon.
ah thats so sad. You would miss your favorite one. i think you need to find something else
You will definitely will 
That mustve really upset you. Did they explain why?
Definitely take some time to vent out your anger. Its totally undestandable.
Wow! What platform was it for? Nintendo or Atari or Sony?
Sounds like you had a great childhood you can try playing it now by downloading an emulator haha I tried that and it was great
thats nice of you to rely on a friend.
then you got good set of friends. Dont lose them for your life!!
Alright I can get behind that. Sistersinlaw are usually angry messes of human beings anyway so Ill back you up on that. What did she do though?
Yeah thats pretty unacceptable. As a former teacher myself I can assure you that as much as I loved those kids my kids would always come first no matter what.
Thats too bad. In all fairness no one really needs a good car. I have a beater but its get me from place to place. Thats all that really matters.
I am sure youll reach your goal one day. I do hope you get that brand spanking new car.
did you say something
did your girlfriend like that
I hope you do well on it! Do you feel prepared?
Thats great! Make sure to check your answers twice!
I do too! Love going out and swimming in the ocean. Why do you like going?
I love doing that too and the price is totally worth it.
Being alone or going bowling  or both?
Id get some new friends thats for sure!!  It stinks when they dont stick with you!
Oh man what are you getting that for? I hope everything is okay.
I am sure. I do hope that they find the cause.
what was the gift ? i can imagine it was something wonderful.
was it colorful or did it play a tune ? 
Are there any favorite tunes that it plays ?
did you try clear it?
okay do it continue it will clear
I can relate.  Whats the saddest movie youve ever watched?
Yea thats a really emotional one for a lot of people.  I see that one mentioned a lot for tear jerkers.
Thats terrible! Are the police doing anything about it?
Oh man. Well be careful out there. Wouldnt want anything to happen to you or your family.
Me too sometimes I still get scared to stare into mirrors in the dark
Hahaha me too definitely
Yikes did it take long to clean it up?
Well I hope your dog is feeling better it would be bad if he was feeling sick or stressed
I am sure you will present a stellar product. What is the powerpoint on?
Sounds pretty cool. I am sure he will end up investing.
Oh yeah? What is the name?
Oh ok. That is a realy good show. I watch it too.
Thats too bad. Do you have any friends or other family that you can do that with?
I am sure. I do hope you find peace with your football watching and your good ole dad.
Thats gross. Did you punish the dog at all
Poor dog I hope she learns from it
Really? What was his first word?
That is a really complex word!
Thats really great to hear. I love my wife too. What does she do that make you appreciate her every day?
Mine does the same! Its nice coming home to a clean house everyday.
Ah that must have been surprise for you
You should also reach out to  her
I do feel bad for them as well its tough to see
People have to look after themselves
Wow thats amazing! Im insanely jealous! I think its pretty normal to be scared of that though. After all it wouldnt be nearly as much fun if it didnt terrify you right?
Exactly! Embrace the danger. Become the danger. Do like 800 flips while youre falling through the air but do yourself a favor and dont vomit okay?
ah thats really gross!!. I hate it road authority do not clear dead animals from the roads asap
We need to do an online petition and raise a complaint against authority!!
Nice! Is it your first time buying?
Good to hear. I hope the house warming party is banging.
OMG. I think I would have passed out.
Did you take the time to walk her outside?
ah thats so sad. why did she is leaving her though?
i am so sure you will miss her. Keep in touch with her though
Oh no Im so sorry to hear that
I bet stay strong!
Nice! Did you get the job?
Wow...I am really sorry friend. Any other interviews lined up?
I hate when that happens and I dont even have a dog
are there places you can take the dog where they teach them not to do that
Im sorry.  It happens to all of us.
I am sure you can go back.
Yeah? Is it decorated well or just very large?
Wow I bet. He must make a lot of money!
I feel the same way. I never thought kids could be that mean!
It is so sad. I worry everyday about my school age kids.
What kind of ladder was it
You can always try again tomorrow
thats amazing and also i would be a little envious I just want love.
I believe its out there for all of us we just gotta find it.
Oh no!  hav you been out looking for her?
Did you put your phone number and things on the sign?
Thats too bad. Maybe you should get a new one?
I certainly would. How can you jam out to all the NOW CDs without it?
Why didnt you want to go anywhere?
Well in that case its better that you just relax.
Yeah what happened next?
Why were you not sleeping
have you taken the test yet
if you studied really hard then you should
Thats terrible. Have you confronted him about it?
Im not sure what that means but you should talk to him about it!
Good luck with that. Are you well prepared?
I would do that too. Its a waste of money if you dont finish it!
I am sorry you felt that way.
On no. Did you get a letter from the IRS?
Yeah I would to if I was in your position. 
Oh my! What a smelly situation. Were you able to clean it up and get the smell out?
Is her litter box full? My cat does that when it is too full and I neglect to clean it.
Thats such an awful feeling! I at least do it twice a year 
I feel you. Last time I did that I was late for work...I hate it when it happends.
Hmmm maybe thats because you ate it and youve got a sugar rush. I wouldnt worry! That usually fades in a couple hours. 
Eh its okay. Dont beat yourself up about it. Its truly a victimless crime. There are much much worse things you could have done I promise.
I really hate when that happens
next time call the police
No way thats gross. What happened?
Thats disgusting. Some people are pigs.
Oh wow. Do you think you might get sick?
I dont think that s very healthy. 
thats nice family should not fight forever
you only get one family
You must be happy for her!!
ah that sucks!! but you cant help it. Its your friends decision
What a jerk! Why is she always in your biz?
I would get up in her face and show her whos boss. Break out the broom and crack it across her old measly back!
20 pizzas!!!  How did you fit that in your stomach without it exploding?
I think Id look into entering some eating contests if I were you!
Oh no... I hope its for the best
Its okay to have cheat days sometimes! Start again tomorrow!
What type of diet are you following?
That is interesting. Did you have a good time?
I bet! I would be too scared to even try!
I hope you can get treated.
I am sure you will get better.
Oh no!  Did she say anything about it?
I think that as a bit harsh!  It wasnt like you did it on purpose thinking it would be funny or anything.
Wow did that bother your coworkers?
You might want to find a new job
Ah I certainly know the feeling of bringing back old memories. Its fun to go back and remember the people you shared all those classes with isnt it?
I know exactly what you mean! All the old flames the old rivalries everything is like it was yesterday. Its a pretty cool feeling.
Awesome. Is he learning to cook for the first time?
Oh wow. Well good for him! I know that makes you happy!
Is that a favorite of yours?  Ive never watched it.
I know how you feel. Ive had shows that Ive loved that have ended and its like losing a best friend.  Im sorry its ending.
oh I only have a few more years with mine too
Yeah? Me too I used to be afraid of aliens. What were you scared of?
Yes he could be! Maybe you should check under the bed right now. He could be watching you.
What a jerk. Why doesnt he get a job at McDonalds?
I would remove him from your family tree. That will show him.
Credit card? That seems like an invasion of privacy
Yeah maybe have a talk with her. Or maybe think positive she might be getting you a gift? Haha
Story of my everyday life. I swear I ear a jingle for hours
Ugh Its such a weird brain function.
I bet! You may have to wash your car to get that smell out!
lol. Hopefully that will be the last one you run over.
Its good that you went easy on her.
Thats terrible! Did you confront them about it?
Sounds like the right move. Good on you for standing up for yourself.
How come? Were you scared you wouldnt wake up?
Aww thats sad to hear. I hope you didnt lose too much sleep!
Thats too bad. Have you seen a doctor about it?
Ah makes sense. Just drink milk everyday and it should be fine in a week.
Thats pretty dumb. Did you eventually get the part?
Ah. What a terrible inconvenience!
Oh no! How are you going to clean it out?
Yikes! That must have been terrible
Nice! How did that feel?
Oh how did she look? Still pretty?
wow how much
thats a nice chunk of change
Thats really annoying. Was the wrong order any good? 
Hm.. judging from your conditions maybe McDonalds isnt the best place for your to eat anyway! 
I think thats a positive thing. Motivation is the key. Do you think hell follow through and actually attend the gym ?
you will be a great motivational coach. Such positivity !
On no. Dont be too hard on yourself. You must have needed the rest.
I understand. But you are human! 
Thats awful! Were you able to clean it off?
Oh no I hope you can get the shoe removed from your foot.
Aw thats exciting! I think I would swell with pride if a swear word were my kids first word too!
WOWAOEAOEAEOHHHH now that was unexpected! Are you at all concerned that youre raising a Communist or have you decided to embrace the hammer and sickle and seize the means of production?
Were you any good in high school or was it just fun?
Oh okay well that sounds nice. I havent played much tennis but I miss having more free time to do similar hobbies.
Awesome! What breed is your dog?
How sweet. I might get one myself then.
Hey now youre an all star! Did you know they wrote that song with the hopes of giving their fans more confidence? 
Yeah theyre a great group. Very fun and uplifting.
How fun! I remember the good old days with those games you didnt need a monthly subscription to
Yeah theyre all pay to play I think you should be able to play the whole game the first time you buy it...
Why dont you change your provider?
Why you dont have a choice?
That must be annoying.
You should call the police on him.
Well they deserve it. Medical school is not easy and they spent unimaginable effort and hard work to finish it
I truly respect and admire those people. They are the most beneficial members of the society
Well maybe he trusted you as a good friend next time try to help him with his homework instead
Oh yeah thats not great. Next time make sure to say no directly to his face
I am sure you will! Did you make sure you took time working on it?
Then I know you will do great! Good luck!
I love boots fall is best for fashion
now you have me excited too
Is she still single? Some people dont like to be in a relationship
Hahaha well she found the one I guess
Yikes that sounds horrifying
I would be grossed out too
You are lucky to have that in your community.
It is good that you care about that too.
Thats the worst part I just finished one aswell ended up doing pretty well.
yep its the not knowing that gets to you most.
Uh oh. I am sorry. What happened?
I am sorry. At least you tried.
Do you have a pet
Did you gave any pet name to your cat
Oh yeah me too. They can be so rude. 
You are right. Some people should never drive a car again!
I understand that feeling sometimes.
You can tell me anything.
whys that?? were they growing out of them
wow thats slightly harsh but they have to learn some way.
I like that too
I wants had a smoothie that was terrible there
What a wonderful time for your family! Is it a boy or girl?
Oh fun! A little girl will be a great addition to the family
But america is so great now! look at all the great things that are happening and are great
No he truly is lower than a dog himself
Really??? A power out does not sound that scary
Now that is scary!! Without power for days would be a nightmare 
Why and whats HOA?
The thing I dont like is that the HOA monitors that type of stuff.
Did you get really wet? I hope you didnt catch a cold
Oh well Im sure they didnt judge you it could happen to anyone
I think we all did lol
that had to be a long time ago
yeah may be kids changed nowadays!!
then you should instigate something in school!!
Do you like old western movies
Thats ok I did not know much about it
Ah new version of Tom and Jerry. You would  be thinking whether to get or not!!
You should then wait for it. Not sure how much time it will take though!!
I hope so too what kind of operation is it?
I dont believe in god but I hope you have a good doctor
Oh thats so sad how often do you get to visit them?
Maybe video chat them a bit more talk to them daily to let them feel your presence
Thats great. I should visit you once for your great Pasta!!
you are so skillful!! you should start your own brand!!
Who is the singer?
I am a huge fan of hers too!
Fun did you play with your siblings?
Ahh I dont have any siblings but I bet it was a great time
Oh man thats so disappointing when they do that. Starts off the whole day wrong.
Yeah small hint of peace in the morning before your hectic work day starts and all those meetings.
I know what you mean. I feel the same sometimes but honestly its not realistoc
That is true. They probably look way different in person
How come? Do you not trust him?
Oh dont think like that it will only make things worse. Just be supportive and focus on yourself
Oh I bet! Did you just go on vacation? 
Wow so happy for you. I have always wanted to go myself.
Oh no that is terrible.
Im sorry that happened to you.
Fun what concert is it?
Whoop! its gonna be a fun time!
Wow! Did you confront her about it?
What a horrible thing to witness
Yay! where are you going? are you excited?
wow you are so lucky I love the beach
Aw thats a shame. Is he a house dog or an outside one?
I would be as well. I would just keep a close eye on him whenever you can. Be his eyes.
Oh well you can celebrate it a couple days late its fine
Dont worry just appreciate him everyday
awwww..its tough leaving lifelong family pets
i dont blame you. i moved out at 17 and i couldnt ever move back..
I hope you pass! You tried your best
You should celebrate when you hear back!
I have done that way too many times  maybe use the air drter in the bathroom?
thats hilarious and terrible at the same time.
Do you just walk alone usually?
Maybe you can invite someone every now and then like a neighbor or someone you trust.
She sounds like a good person.
You also sound like a good person.
did you do good? or get smacked around alot?
Thats right! they didnt wanna to see the slaughter anymore.
How sweet. What breed is the dog?
Oh ok. That is so nice of yall. That does not happen often enough.
Really? Why do you do that?
Yeah I understand that. I hope you feel better!
Me too I am very lucky to have moved. I used to live in a place with a lot of earthquakes and hurricanes
Yes its a traumatic experience to be in an earthquake
That is a good way to think.
I like your positive attitude!
Where did you go? did you enjoy yourself?
why?? its good time to think
Oh I am sorry to hear that. You will get another chance I am sure
Dont feel too hard on yourself. I am sure you did your best.
oh why not!! quality is better than quantity!!
ah that is also there. You will make new friends!!
Oh no my dear what happened to your leg?
Oh wow. Was it a bad car wreck?
Good for you. Socializing through such ways is a great way to enjoy your time. And besides I am not Star Wars fan and have not watched any of the movie series
Costume parties are very fun to attend. If i ever attend one then i will go in iron man suit. I just love that character and its personality
It sounds like you are a loyal customer! How did you feel about them taking your headphone jack from their cellphones?
I suppose thats true although I heard a lot of people were not happy with it.
That sounds scary!
Good thing you didnt get lost!
oh my god just your luck huh  thats crazy.
Me either I have broken every phone ive owned!
WHAT HAPPENED?? DID YOU EVER GET IT BACK?!?
did they have an explenation on what happened?
How exciting! Hopefully it doesnt hurt too bad.
Wow I bet you were surprised!
LOL a bat how random
Thats amazing! I love finding new places like that.
I hope it does and you can KEEP going there! haha
Did you cover it up or tell them about it?
Now that is what I am talking about!
Whoa! How are you feeling from it now?
Its okay to give in to cravings every now and then.
Wow you were able to do that?
you should reduce the intake!!
Whys that?! is it rotting out?
thats gross go see the dentist please!
Unfortunately it happens to all of us.
You will if you believe you can!
What did you order?! was it delicious?
thats awesome I love applbees I like to drink there alot
True friends can be tested at such situations. Good for you to have such friends. It is very rare to have such ones
I have only 23 close friends with whom I closely associate. I think that is the ideal number one should have
I agreee and I see no point in it This is all our country we are all one here why fight.
very bleak maybe we will have some sort of saving grace candidate.
I could imagine we have a whole mountain of it around my apartment building just randomly lying around.
Exactly! Id like to pick it up with a scooper and throw it in their faces.
oh my god! did you confront him about it?
Perfect make him think you dont know or dont know everything.
OMG Id be so upset. Did you confront him about it?
I wish you all the luck!
Oh no! Did they even leave a note of any kind?
Id be livid! Some people just wont let us have nice things I swear.
that sounds great I hope you get it!
Im always nervous at job interviews!
oh no were you able to calm him down?
im glad he was able to get some relief from that storm anxiety 
i am sorry to hear that. was it a clean break?
i can understand that. it is hard at first but then it gets better. 
Im very sorry for your loss.
I hope you will be at peace soon.
Oh no! What was he accused of?
Well maybe this will teach him a lesson and hell come out of prison a new man.
uh oh is everything okay? are you nervous? 
thats true its always good to get testing and precautionary procedures. 
darn Have you been working towards one lately?
have you been passed over it before?
Really! I bet he was a real manly man then!
Its always nice to have someone show you things. Youre very lucky.
That sounds great were you nervous about the interview?
Thats good. Dogs are the best but an obedient dog is even better!
I cant wait to have a dog. Maybe when my daughter is older..
oh that much Will you be able to do it?
thats the confidence. I am sure you will do it
Im glad that you care about others.
LOL!! im sorry about that  did you get him back?
hahaha thats true thats not the worst outcome
oh man!! i hope you are ok. please tell me someone recorded it
that sounds like a crazy day
Eek! Hopefully your keyboard isnt acting up!
Thats a good idea! Or use a vacuum if you can.
better be careful! the weather has been bad here lately too.
nothing worse than being unprepared for a disaster 
Oh what job is it?
Wow that is very high position!
oh my god thats alot of ham Did he throw it up after?
Thats a real eater right there big belly.
Aww I can remember the first time my son said daddy. I thought my heart was going to explode.
It really is. kids can sure bring a wave of emotions upon us.
Thats amazing! You must be so happy
Hard work pays off
I do that all the time lol hey if its in there its up for grabs!
He should have eaten it sooner!
yes there have been.i live in south texas and they are bad here
yeah those do help.set up a perimiter
Im sure youll make new friends really soon. 
Thats a great idea! Maybe go to the park too and meet people there.
Oh how horrible. Im sorry sorry to hear that.
Aww I hope so too. Dogs are precious and they arent here long. We have to be happy for our time with them no matter what.
Im sure you did amazing did you study hard for it?
When will you find out your scores?
That would be great! It would certainly save you from having to buy a new car for a while.
What kind of car can you win?
yea  have a cat i like him
That sucks I hate when that happens!
Did you return the favor at all so to speak?
Thats good! Have  you met in person?
Totally understandable... Id be a bit apprehensive too
Really! Thats awesome! Was there something new in it you dont usually use?
I think lasagna is one of my favorite things to make
It can be a fun thing as long as one doesnt go overboard.
Yeah I have had some legendary hangovers. I try to moderate better these days haha.
That sounds really relaxing and nice.
Well hopefully it doesnt rain or anything.
its understandable they are so annoying
yea i hate it
oh no im sorry to hear that
itll get better in time
thats insane stuff
man thats really disheartening you should type faster  tho
Thats great! Wheer are you gonna go?
Thats a fun place to go. Youll have to be sure to take lots of pics!
You cant believe they did it without asking or that the car needed the repairs?
Wow I hope everything works out for you!
Wow thats crazy. Is it very cold where you are living?
Interesting you say that. Here its warm as well and we had a big rain storm and got some large hail as well!
thats quite nice of them
yea i bet that feels good
Oh no! Hope your cat is feeling okay.
Thats the thing about pets hard to stay mad at them!
Thats so impressive!
Hopefully she seems really smart.
that must be so hard to deal with 
He seems to be on the right path now then
Wow did anyone let you at least know?
Wow that is super unlucky did she notice at all?
thats really annoying to deal with
still tho thats dangerous
im sorry to hear that. loss of a pet is tough
are you planning on getting another pet?
How long do you have to wait?
Good luck! Im sure you did great.
Oh wow how long has it been since you got last promoted?
Well I hope you get it!
Are you prepared for it? Did you study?
I know what you mean. I think youll do great though.
sounds quite hard to deal with but good luck
yea i would be too
I definitely understand that feeling.  It took me forever to sign up for my Speech Communications class because of speaking in public.
I actually took it late evening class without too many students and even was scared and only had to speak in front of the professor.
Thats fair having a father figure be present is really important.
I hate shark movies too. Thats why I refuse to swim in the ocean.
The only way Ill get in is if Im too drunk to care if I get eaten lol
Congratulations! That is great news to hear!
Yes! It is always good to have a positive attitude.
Life can have some sudden turns. But these are very little chances to count on and hope for
Good for him. But do not count on such things happening in life. They are very rare unless you put hard work to get them
That sucks hopefully you can come back from that
That is usually pretty unlikely but Im rooting for you.
That sounds nice how long has it been?
Indeed enjoy your time away!
What kind of games?
Oh I enjoyed board games when I was little too
oof sounds so bad
Oh no that must have been embarrassing! 
Did anyone see it happen?
Wow that mustve been really scary!
Im sure I wouldve been shaking as well!
What do you mean exactly? She doesnt have the same passion when speaking to you?
Oh wow Im sorry to hear that. That must hurt.
wow. are you ok? that can be really unnerving 
i would be to. people need to be more aware on the road
thats very cute to do that
yea i bet it does
I love watching heavy storms with thunder and lightening!
Yeah as long as it is loud but not too close I usually love it!
That sounds terrible I hate losing a pet...
Did you end up getting another ever?
Thats great! Its such a good feeling working with people you actually like..
I hope you have more nights like it!
Thats great! What are some things youre enjoying about life right now?
Oh man having weekends off is such a deal breaker for me too. 
Kids are sweet. They will do everything to get what they want. So did her mom made him Kraft Dinner eventually?
Dont be upset about it. Kids do not yet have conscious ability to think concretely in terms of others feelings
Thats very nice of you. I hope she gets the issues sorted out!
Yes I can imagine it must be hard for you as well. I wish you guys all the best.
that is terrible. nevermind being embarassed i would have been mad and hungry!! 
i dont blame you
Thats a good sign you did great then
Good luck! I hope you get it.
Oh no! I would have asked for the manager! What did you do?
I cant imagine why that person would do that! So unreasonable.
Was there any reason you couldnt go? Did they not invite you?
Thats wonderful! I hope you had or have a great time!
Thats so cool! I really wish I had a dog!
I really like cats but I want a dog at some point.
Ugh I hate when that happens. Do you think the cat ate something bad?
I bet. Poor kitty I hope heshe feels better soon.
i bet it did i would be too
i bet it is good luck with tha
Oh yeah I hate rats too actually.
Oh wow that sounds so scary! I might have done the same actually!
I am not a fan of snaked either.
I once was bitten by a snake luckily it had no venom.
Sorry to hear that. Must feel quite lonely for you.
Luckily you can always contact your husband to see how he is doing and hear his voice.
Oh no did you tell them?
If its not bad I wouldnt tell them
haha welcome to Tinder! Its the app of mixed signals. Did things work out finally?
Yeah usually you just move on. There are plenty more fish in the sea!
I know what you mean scary movies really terrify me!
Thats always a great way to make me feel more at ease!
Same here who accused you?
Frick isnt a curse word.
Same here! What makes you nervous
Yeah thats the same reason as me.
that is bad news. my mother is going through the same thing unfortunately. landlord became widowd and now is moving with her daughter in anothe state so will be selling the house
that is tough. my mothere also has her little dog. but more than likely she will move in with my family
Double the fun are these your first children?
Congrats you should try to sleep some thou.
You sound very confident! how will you make that happen?
great! I wish i could find a profitable business.  i dont like worker for other people.
I have not seen those but that sounds cute. Are you married?
Yep theres nothing wrong with either of those things!
I hate those kind of storms for good reasons.  We have lightning storms all the time in Georgia.  The power is more than likely to go out.
Yes indeed  Ive had to deal without power for 48 hours the last bad storm.  Almost three years ago I was actually struck by lightning while in my home. 
thats so cool nice job of him
thats great good for you.
Oh thats great news!
You are a good friend I think
Really? Thats insane!
Cool that sounds like a great weekend!
I do not like Tinder. What did she do?
That is too bad dont give up hope thou.
Oh that is pretty terrifying! What caused it?
Oh thats a relief though!
That could have been a scary situation. How was the party?
Thats good. I guess you never know what to expect sometimes.
I love Disney World who are you going with?
Hopefully you have enough time to see all the parks.
Oh no! Dont blame yourself. It happens
Better luck next time!
thats a fair point
yea i bet it is
Thats great how did it go?
Yep thats the way to do it!
that would be cool. do you have singing experience ?
so am i .im a guitar player not a singer
Did you figure out a way to pay it thou?
That was very nice of her.
Aw thats the worst especially when the clothes are new!
Thats pretty annoying that nobody told you!
Wow thats good for him. What do you think changed for him?
Thats cool! Its always good to hear when people decide to take a good step forward.
Are you happy for him?
Do you have a girlfriend?
Ive never even heard of that before!
Oh cool! Sounds like fun!
why do you say that? are you worried about the current state of affairs?
He may not.  He has certainly made a few enemies.
Oh Im sorry to hear that about your grandmother.  Im close to my grandmother so I would definitely need for the doctors to provide the best of care.  Im sure you are looking for a speedy recovery.
Thats a great position to take especially when something like this occur.  It puts so many things in perspective on whats important.  Im glad you have good doctors so you can focus on just being there for her.
Oh no! I always like to pick out what Im wearing the night before. Maybe that would help?
It really could help. I heard Einstein used to wear the same clothes everyday because it would help him stay focused on his studies! 
eh its worth it tho
still worth it imo
That was nice of them did you pay them?
That was nice you should help them next time.
What did you get him?
Does he grill a lot?
Oh so it was your work? Thats understandable then.
Wow that doesnt sound like a very good relationship. Did you talk to her about it?
Wow Im sorry I hope you can figure something out!
Good for you. I had couple of interviews couple of years ago. Was very nervous but thankfully they all went well. My advice just try to hide your nervousness and show confidence
So when are you expected to hear back for final decision on your hire?
thats understabled i get it
i get what you meam
what?!?! how? what happend if you dont mind me asking
wow. glad to hear you are ok
Oh no! Did she move away from your city?
Well hopefully you feel better about the situation. It will hurt for awhile.
You must of been so proud of him.
Will he be going to college?
Did you get the B?
That is great news good job.
Oh that sucks. What role were you applying for?
Cool sorry to hear that you didnt get it.
How did he do that?
That is great do you ever help him study?
Im not that into sports. What do you like about them?
Thats fair good for them then!
Aww.. I am so sorry for your loss. It is so hard to lose our loved ones. 
It sometimes helps to remember the good times you had together.  
Geez hopefully they get caught someday for driving so reckless. Good to hear you are okay.
thats smart of you
i would always do that
That sounds great its always nice to have a new place to play like that!
Glad you have a place like it to enjoy
How long dd you do that for?
The cat must of got tired.
That was brave of you to talk to her.
Thats always a good idea. I respect that.
Thats a good way to be a parent. They will grow up to be more honest and respectable.
How long has he been in the Navy?  I have a bonus son my sons best friend who has been in the Navy for about a year now.
Thats a nice commitment.  My father is an Air Force veteran.  Im not too fond of the military but it definitely makes a difference in the lives of many.
Yes I love 80s rock n roll.
Yes I wish I could go back in a time machine.
Ugh tell me about it. Her and Trump both make me feel that way.
He doesnt really say anything of substance in my opinion. Just vague words. But hey to each his own!
Does she come over every day?
Maybe you should cook for her one night.
I am sure a B or A is just as good.  Which class was it?
Ohhh thats a hard subject. I struggled with physics a lot but not as much as chemistry.
Thats so lucky! How much did you win?
Thats a good amount cool!
Are you going to see her again?
I thought you hit it off thou?
wow i would be so sad if i saw that
yea i would die if i saw that
Oh god what happened?
Im glad you are okay. That sounds terrifying!
Congratulations. That is very good luck you had. To be honest i am not really interested in those scratch tickets as i think they are just waste of my hard earned money
Good. But my advice to you is do not count on them too much as they have astronomically low chances of winning even anything at all
Holy cow thats a large limit! And I thought my 2500 limit was decent!
Just be careful and dont get too excited and start swiping it all over!
Wow thats pretty impressive! Have you been training a lot?
Thats awesome to have that type of dedication.
When is her birthday?
Where will you have the party?
Where did he meet her?
Not when where I asked?
I hope so too! So are you a teacher or substitute or what?
What kind of math do you teach?
What did you steal from him?
Why dont you return it?
Same especially being as attractive as he is.
He pretty much has everything at this point.
Where and when did this happen?  I havent looked at the news lately to avoid hearing sad news.  The last incident of the duck boat accident was very saddening.
Oh wow.  I will definitely need to look at that.  Was there many casualties?
I think kids should all be home schooled.
They can hire teachers to come to the house.
I love tacos! Do they serve other mexican food?
Sounds delish! I really like Moes southwest grill. If you get the chance you should try it.
Sorry to hear that will you get another dog?
Do you have any other pets?
Thats non fun. Im sorry to heard that. Maybe you shouldnt go there anymore?
The food is not very healthy so you are not missing much
thats no fun! i love to swim and be in the pool or beach. but i work too much to go
yes you should. its not hard!
I love cruises where is your cruise headed?
Have you ever been there before?
Sorry to hear that. Its tough when unexpected things like that happen.
Man the tax system needs a complete overhaul. Hope things work out for you in the future.
Did you tell him you wanted it?
Will he buy you a cake when you shop next time?
You sound very confident! What sport do you play?
That sounds fun! I like boats but I dont think I would be a good rower.
What plane crash are you referring to?
I never heard about it. Im glad nobody died though!
Why dont you do the same thing?
All you can do is keep working hard.
Happy Birthday to You!  I love birthdays so much.  Just recently celebrated by youngest daughters 14th birthday on August 9th and my granddaughters 4th birthday on August 10th.  When iswas your birthday?
My daughter just had a nice birthday dinner with family.  My granddaughter had a couple of parties. What kind of party do you plan on having?
Wont you enjoy less chaos?
The kids can always visit you.
Have you ever talked on the phone at movies yourself?
Well Its always fun to get the people on their phones thrown out of the movie theater
Thats awful! What kind of car do you have?
Those are good cars.  I have a volkswagen beetle and I love it!
Make a pizza it is a fail safe choice.
Yes pizza with some olive oil and balsamic vinegar dipping. 
Did you get hurt or just your car?
I hope they caught the guy.
I hope its not Game of Thorns??
I need to look it up never heard of it.
That is a well trained dog how did you get it to respond like that.?
My dog is the worst Always crys he is pretty young. But I wish he was like your dog.
Uh oh that sounds bad.  Is it your wife?
Do you know who it is?
those are always good memories
i agree. no one can ever take those from us
Aw that sounds sweet. Youre wonderful for doing that and Im sure you cant wait to get there!
I hope everything goes well for you!
what kind is she alive?
Too bad is you window broken now?
Did you threw it back into his car?
Unfortunately there are people like that in this world but maybe they can change someday.
were you happy to see him after that long time?
seeing the people you love in real life feels always different im glad you were happy!
Yes I think people that work these jobs should call in sick when they are not in a mood.
Same here CS is just as important as the products we buy.
Did you end up reading any reviews on it first?
Well you should take a leap of faith and go in with an open mind.
Great for what store?
Its rare this days for people to hand make gifts or anything.
Why didnt you ?
Did they get mad at you?
were you shocked it happened so fast?
best to block her in every way so you dont hear about her life
What happend? Do you have test results pending?
Well what you should do first is be with your family and those who care about you.
Cool where did you go?
This is a trail where you can walk for months?
I love coming home too. 
I just love relaxing here. My favourite thing is no neighbours !
really? what was it about?
that sounds so interesting!
Is this your first time?  I know that is something that I would even ever consider.  My fear of heights would render me completely lifeless.  So are you doing the real skydiving or in one of these indoor skydiving places?
Well I am working my way up to taking a flight across the oceans perhaps one where Im in a plane in the sky for over 8 hours.  Outside of that I will give it to you that you are really brave.
If your son is very young and you give him an allowance then tie it to that!
Haha sadly it does not. I still hold off on doing it in my own apartment at 26. Unless they are very young I dont think here really is a good way unless it smells
how what made you feel? do tell
wow!! that sounds horrible! i cant believe she even tried to get your number! did you give it to her? hahah
man what happened next i would have been looking for a place to hide
I bet that was a relief and pretty funny when you look back on it.
That sounds like your job is going well.
I bet you feel really respected and welcome there.
Thats great for your sister but you must have felt left out.
Did she invite you another year?
Did you have fun when you got to go?
I guess learning to appreciate positives and get past negatives is part of life 
What instrument do they yplay?
Oh thats great! You must be very proud.
do you have all your gear ready to go ?
that sounds fun but dangerous at the same time is it ?
Oh no! You must have been pretty frustrated.
Thats great that you had someone to help you.
Oh yeah? Are you excited?
Thats great. I hope you have a wonderful time.
Oh no i bet that is frustrating. Have you ever used him before?
I cant stand noisy pipes. I hope he is able to fix it for you. 
Thats a bummer. Sorry to hear that but I am sure you can reschedule right?
I would be to if I were in your shoes.  I would be very disappointed too.
Awesome I love pasta. 
Lol that sounds wild did you text them something appropriate?
Hopefully he can take constructive criticism I think more people should be open to that.
Thats the worst! What did you do?
Saved you the money from having to call pop a lock.
Awww how sweet. is he your only child? It does get easier....
I felt the same way when my youngest started school. They grow up so fast. 
I just cannot understand why people wont do their job properly I had to cut my lunch break in order to do more work
That is so sad they dont seem to understand workers.
That is nice from you. What card is it?
Oh wow that sounds unfortunate. Is there no way to ask the neighbor to take it easy?
That sounds terrible. I hate to hear single mothers dealing with extra problems like these. If anything I would advise your son to be careful and defend himself.
Aw good on her. I bet she knew exactly how it would make you feel too. Things people do personally themselves always have the better result.
Now its your turn! Surprise her with something that will remind her of something special too. People hate to hear it but our parents are only with us for so long and when theyre gone we have so many regrets. Use that as a motivator
I know that feeling so frustrating!  Do you think theres a chance the person will change?
Im sorry!  Maybe you could try distancing yourself from this person you have to protect yourself first.
Oh god..They do that to me TOO! And we have poison water! Are they going to fix it?
Oh..the phone part is the worst! And being transferred and retelling the story! I am glad they reversed it though! Most companies wont!
Im sorry to hear that. Do you have a plan to change things?
Thats terrible but good for you for having a plan. Youll get through it your happiness is the most important thing!
Oh that is nice! Why did they move back?
Oh fantastic! I am sure they are happy to be home.
That happens sometimes but Im sure you will make a lot of new friends in your new job.
That is good maybe you can still hang out with them outside of work.
Could it be fixed at all? 
I am sorry to hear that but luckily noone got hurt.
Good friends are invalueble.
I know how you feel... people also get married and have kids.
Was it a slow leak or was it somethign else?
As long as you have an easy way to fill it up.
Thats great news! I find most people are good honest folk. Its the few rotten ones that make us forget that.
Thats so nice of you. As I said most people are very nice. You at least now have peace of mind.
Wow Did you see a doctor?
That is good.
Do you expect it to be positive?
If your review is good could you get a bonus?
That is good are you going to have a nap?
What do you do to relax?
Thats great. Do you get a bonus?
Thats great. What do you sell?
That must be such a relief to get another semester behind you. Its hard waiting to get your grades though Im sure.
Best wishes to you on your upcoming courses. I have a feeling you will be very successful.
Well it is good you have a friend that is so close to you that you feel comfortable sharing with them. 
Trust is a hard thing to find I am so glad you found this bond with this person.
Thats so annoying. Maybe you should leave earlier next time too.
I am not really a football fan but it is fun to be a part of something!
Really?  What did they do to impress you so much?
Wow!  That sounds amazing and complicated!  Now I understand why you were positively surprised!
That is great. Did you watch all Harry Potter movies?
I like also a lot Harry Potter movies.
did it bring a lot of memories?
yeah theres nothing like the good old days
Well that wasnt a very nice thing to do! Think of it as getting a new beard rather than losing the old friend.
I dont think youre overreacting. That is something important to you and they should have realized that. Maybe its time for new friends?
Yeah I have a few friends like that. We hang out now and again but there are others Id rather spend my time with.
Thats nice of her.  What was the occasion?
Ha thats nice of her! Well if you havent had your wedding yet I hope it turns out super nice!
That must be stressful to your friend.
Thats good that you are content with what you have. 
Omg that must have been really embarrassing. Did anyone came to your rescue?
Haha. I can just imagine you running away. 
Oh that is so nice! Was it a special occassion?
Thats lovely. I love when people just give small gifts to each other for no reason.
Hows that working out for you.
I once lost a wallet with a heavy sume of ash in it and I tried to have faith tht I would find it or some I trusted would find it and return it back to me.
Yes you were just mentioning it. What happened?
Did you have your wallet returned to you? If its your relative I think that everything should work out for good.
Oh that is so wonderful! How old is he?
Thats so sweet. 
That was nice of you. What kind of soup.
That sounds really good!
Where did he go? Is he calling you?
Thats annoying. Have you talked to your boss about it?
That can be tough. Hopefully shell understand.
Oh that is great! I have had great success doing keto and fasting for not feeling so hungry! Carbs and sugar do me in! What kind of lunches do you make?
true! I dont mind the same things. You can do healthy it just takes more prep and ingredients sometimes to do it tasty and healthy
Thats horrible! What happened to you? Who stabbed you in the back?
Thats really difficult to deal with. When you love someone you lower your guard for that person and more than anyone else theyre the ones that can hurt you the most. I hope you find a resolution to your problem.
That sounds interesting I would love to get a piercing. Where will you be getting the piercing?
Darn it! I have never seen that before now I am would like to see what it looks like
Oh no! I would be so angry! 
Thats so wrong. Id speak to a supervisor
Wow I bet he was really surprised he got to meet him. What did he think of him in person?
Thats great. Its good to see celebreties be the same in real life as they are on the internet or TV.
Oh god I hate flying. I always seem to get the plane that ends up having some issue.
Yeah I will drive almost anywhere rather than fly if I can.
Haha.. Im sorry that made me laugh a little bit. I do that sometimes too and have no idea how I can forget so many times. I think at least if it happens almost no one can really tell or notice if that helps.
Well you could have been going commando too. And shame on them for not letting you know. Lets focus on the positivesyou can pull off skinny jeans and youre interesting enough to want to wear Superman underwear. Keep it up
Did the company not pay you well enough?
Well that was a long time ago I dont think you need to carry it around with you anymore unless youre still doing it.
Gross. What did you do?
i think you could have removed them and still ate it. isnt that normal for them to have bugs in them sometimes?
That is amazing! I bet she had to work hard for that.
Thats great. I think education is more important than ever
Im sorry to hear that hopefully she naturally mellows out.
Wow that doesnt sound good. Situations like this are hard because you probably dont want to offend your family and stuff.
How exciting!  I remember when my girls said their first words!  What was his first word do you know?
Yeah that seems to be what a lot of little ones say for their first word.  Something about it being easier than ma ma  congrats to the little tyke!
wow good for her! Im sure she worked really hard to get a degree
im sure she will be able to find a really great job now !
I am so sorry that you have to go through that on your day off. Just try to be nice to her.
Maybe you need to go to the store and bring her flowers and chocolate
I dont envy you there. I have done the blind family meeting at a holiday dinner before. Its nerve racking. 
Well my advice is to give in now because you probably will in the end anyway and avoid any extra arguing you two would do because of it.
Oh no I am so sorry you have to leave your furbaby! Give her lots of extra snuggles and explain to her that you will be back and I am sure she will be delighted to see you upon your return!! Have you ever left her before?
I believe dogs can understand what you tell them they understand if we say treat or ride after all lol. Maybe you could send a small blanket that smells like you or an old tshirt you have worn to bed. That may help her to feel more comfortable!
Thats awesome!  Does he have any plans for what hes doing after high school?
Thats great to hear!  Good luck to him!
Awesome! What does his new house look like?
Oh a pool! Inground or above ground?
Why did they left half of the trash?
Did you complain to municipality?
Thats awful what was he yelling at you about?
LOL.  Yeah been there. Even when those guys do that and are wrong they typically never apologise. They just pretend like they werent acting like a jerk.
AHHHHHHHHHH!  That is amazing.  I am so jealous of you.  Where are you going?
Where is that?
Have fun!  Im sure you will.
Ah thats so bad. why not raise a complaint
Hope it get resolved soon
Oh no! Do they have. alost and found?
I hope you can figure it out soon!
Oh nice.  Is he the type to tone himself down in social settings...but hes secretly a wiz kid
Well gotta watch out for him...its the quiet unassuming ones that are usually full of surprises
I call them hypocrites. They take advantage of people whenever it suites their needs. Cant stand the presence of such people
I knew a couple of people whom I suspected of fitting the description we talked here. And I tried to stay away from them as much as i could
I love dogs and have three myself. What type of breed is the puppy?
I have two wiener dogs and they are both spoiled brats but I love them. You should be very happy with your girlfriends choice of gifts.
Oh no!  What happened?  Do you think you did ok anyway?
Thats sad to hear   That happened to me before and I came out ok in the end Im sure you will too 
I know how you feel my brother is my best friend but I only talk to him about once a month because he is so busy.  Where is your brother now?
Well I hope you get to talk to him more and maybe can get over there for a visit!
Oh no! Did it leave a dent?
I know how you feel. If I had an accident like that I wouldnt be able to pay either.
Nice! Howd you do
Thats pretty awesome.  How much richer are you now
Did this happen recently?
That is good that the person was courteous. That may not happen everytime
Im sorry to hear that  Was it his fault?
Thats good to hear. How did the other person fare?
Are you jealous by this or does it make you angry?
Are you going to be able to purchase the truck for yourself anytime soon?
True. Do you have any plans for the weekend? 
That sounds fun. I love going to the lake its so relaxing. 
That is awesome that you have such friendly coworkers!
Make sure you give each of them a thank you card
Did you find out what it was
Haha thats pretty funny
Im glad youre feeling well its always important to make your health a priority without our health we have nothing!
You sound very dedicated thats great youre so focused on your health you will age gracefully Im sure!
Thats disgusting. What kind of parent lets their child run around like that.
Yeah really makes you want to touch anything in a store with booger hands wandering around putting his hands on everything.
Sweet! Wouldnt mind one myself. What do they cost new?
Woah! I could live for ten years on that. Hope you wrote down his tag  maybe you could sweettalk him into going for a drive!
That is really mean. I am sorry.
That is so sad. Have you seen or heard from her again?
Do you think she will keep you awake? How old is she?
Maybe you can hide some of your things or put them in a safe place. 
That is so amazing.  Animals have an amazing ability to find their way home.  I wonder if it was out there having a Homeward Bound style adventure.
That is so great Im glad you got your little friend back.
Oh that would kill to see. Maybe he will hook you up.
I would be very jealous. Dont let it get to you too much. At least it doesnt seem like you see him all that often.
Thats awesome. Do you look like him?
That is really nice to have found. I hope you hold onto them in a safe place.
A little homesick?  Are you traveling for vacation or for work?
I understand how you feel.  Maybe its time to change locations?
Oh my god that is terrible. Has it affected you knowing you slept through that kind of event right next door?
I would have as well. I am sorry that happened to you and I hope you can learn to sleep peacefully again.
Yes its important to find somebody who you will be able to trust and also somebody who will love you for being you
thats great to hear! I hope you will meet your true love soon! I believe when you do you will now right away. When i met my husband i knew right away he is the one. such a strange feeling. But weve been married for 5 years now and still crazy about each other
Oh no! Can you ask for an extension? Sometimes theyll be quite accommodating.
That seems strange in this day and age. I thought everything could be done online. Perhaps you could hand deliver those parts.
Good. Where are you going?
I understand. Have a good trip. Are you traveling alone?
Now that is something I would imagine is hard to deal with. I hope you are in a better place.
You just have to keep working at it.
Oh thats terrible. I wouldnt shut it all out though you could miss out on someone great.
Yeah you are right. Better to take things slow and figure out what they are all about first.
Thats really kind of you. Not everyone can or will do that. I do hope she pays you back!
Im sure! Its always nice to help someone in need but you do hope theyll do the right thing by you when possible.
Youre obviously a very good person and Im sure your friend knows that  shell repay you when she can.
Then youll be fine 
Thats pretty heavy. I hope that doesnt discourage you from trying again in the future especially with a rescue dog or something in that area. If you dont mind me asking what happened?
I had never heard of that before. That sounds like tragic timing. And youre right I probably shouldnt have brought up getting another one so soon it just sounded like youd be a good owner since you seem like you care so much. It makes sense for you to not rush right back into it.
That is so great that he was able to go.  I had the same problem as you but I started at community college when I was 26 and finished at a 4 year college when I was 32.  It is never too late for you to go.
They are the best.  I think it is good to go later because you know what you want more and dont waste time and money.
Awesome. Is it the first ime?
Maybe you will a friend soon. Or even meet a nice guy.
Thats horrible. Is it treatable?
Im praying that she will be fully healed and that you will take good care of her.
Everyone in life has problems do not feel bad for sharing yours I hope it gets better for you.
You are welcome I am glad I can put you in a better mood.
Thats fantastic! It must be a good day for you.
Im sure you were pretty nervous after you applied.
A little anxious?  Have you ever flown on a plane before?
Im sure youll be fine. Statistically its safer than driving.
That sounds cool. Do you go fishing a lot?
My dad really enjoyed fishing. I think Id like the peace and quiet of it.
How awesome! She must be proud of herself! Where does she work?
It isnt easy to be successfully selfemployed but she did it! 
That is awesome how long have you been playing?
Have you thought about getting back into it?
Awesome! Do you think did well?
Nice what job did you apply for?
These people are not people you see everyday. I wouldnt worry about it
Watch some youtube videos of other peoples misfortunes so you can forget about yours quickly!
Why would anyone make a party in a shady area? Was it your friends party?
Probably it is just the theme of his party. He wanted to have some fun in the form of cautious excitement
Awe. That is soo sweet. You have some really good friends
That is really nice to have. Most people dont even have one good friend.
that is really such a pain i remember when i had to do my paperwork for school it is not fum
well i really wish you very good luck with all that
That is so nice what kind was it?
That sounds so good I love coconut rum that would have made my birthday awesome Im glad you enjoyed it. 
I used to be that way too.  One thing to think about that might help is even if you do look stupid for a second nobody is going to remember 10 minutes from then.  Another thing that helped me was thinking about how good it felt if a stranger started talking with me in public for a 25 minute conversation and how it didnt upset me or make them look stupid so I shouldnt look stupid if I did the same thing.
Oh really do you feel like you did a great job?
Thats good it must be relieving to feel so confident.
oh yea.. whats that?
Oh nice.  where can I find it?  Netflix?
Did you do something to cause the breakup?
Oh no! Thats a lot of money. Did you get any of it back?
Doesnt give anyone the right to steal it tho. Im so sorry  how awful for you. I hope they had a horrible time when they tried to spend it!
Oh geez stay safe!  Tornadoes are one of those weird things for me.  They sort of scare me but before they happen and its raining yet still outside I love going out to see whats happening.
hahaha I dont know if people today would rather lose electricity or get a tornado.  Either way I hope you stay safe and if a tornado does come you dont take any damage!
It is important to have a focus on something positive.
Nothing in life is certain the only control you have is to decide what to do with the time that has been given to you.
That must mean they think youre a pretty cool person! People usually dont go through that kind of effort unless they think youre worth it and deserve it. So kudos to you for having that kind of effect on others!
Oh you dont work with them anymore? Or maybe it was because you decided to be a stayathome mother? 
You may need to go to the barber shop!
The barber shop is totally worth it. They do such a good job.
Thats terrible! I hope it didnt end up inside them?
Okay well thats good at least. I hope you find it soon!
Well that was rude did you confront him?
I would ask him how it went and casually say I would have gone had you asked.
Thats awesome!  Youre really lucky.
Im sure it took a lot of hard work to get to that point!
Oh man! That sucks! Did anyone happen to see it?
I am sorry you have to deal with that. What a pain!
Congratulations! That sounds like a lot of great news in one month!
I really hope it does. Just stay positive!
What did you find out??
Oh wow are you excited?? I would assume so if you agreed to go on a date.  I hope you guys have a great time!
Im so curious. What happened at church?
Oh little mistakes like that happen its no big deal!
You hate it when what happens?
Oh yeah that it the worst. Were you able to wash it out at least?
I get really anxious too. What are you having surgery on?
Ive had that done before.  The waking up with gauze in your mouth is the worst part.
did it bring back a lot of memories?
yeah theres nothing like the good old days 
Good for you.  How is it going?
Pretty good here  just a homeschooling mom of 2 trying to get some laundry done.  Im glad you are on the path you want to be on!
Lol I love a good Jason Statham movie
What made you blush so hard?
Hey you have got to do what you have got to do. Hopefully next time youre closer to home when you need to go.
Did you watch it late at night? I rarely watch scary movies.
I dont blame you. You are going to have to watch them during the day next time.
That sounds exciting!
How old is your nephew?
Yeah glasses suck but so does not being able to see. Good that your class mates are nice people.
Yep Ive got terrible eyes. I know what you mean.
Oh well that would have been embarrassing but if you were trying to shed a few pounds I would say your doing a great job! 
Go buy you some new snazzy belts! Haha!
I know how you feel. What helped me was getting a bicycle and get out in the sun for some exercise.
I feel you. Well it sounds like you keep yourself busy with a hobby at least. 
That is really something to be thankful for. I have lost 2...So for sure!
Its okay! Life happens! Cherish your babies always 
Where did you go shopping?
I love the thrift stores. i can spend hours in there.
I buy a lot of kids clothes from there. I also go to a salvage store called Dirt cheap great deals!
Sounds like a cool Goodwill.
Do you feel like you are prepared?
Well make sure you get a good nights rest sleep is just as important.
wow thats horrible.  I hate the way they make the system to steal money
Maybe it might be worth trying again now with another doctor?
I saw it when I was much older but my parents didnt let me watch it when I was young.  I bet.  That wouldnt be like real life for really being left home alone. 
I forgot about that part!  Yes!  Terrifying!  Hope you didnt have too many nightmares over it.
I didnt have an interview.  did you?
I hope you get it too.  Goodluck
Wow! Did she say yes?
Sorry to hear that. Are you breaking up with her?
Oh no Im sorry.  What went badly?  One things or just lots of little things?
I completely get it.  Hope things are better tomorrow!
Oh fantastic! What did you guys do?
By her you mean wife?
Thats so embarrassing but hey everyone has those moments once in a while. 
Good idea! And if ever you go back just take it slow and easy.
thats sad bad memories ?
yeah i understand you but people change and we learn from them and that helps us grow more dont take it too personally 
Oh good luck man! Hopefully everything works out! 
We can only hope so! Get her some flowers! 
Hm thats not good. How so if I may ask?
Sounds like quite a problem! I think you should try different foods and narrow down which ones trouble you.
WHAT? Do live in california?
That is so awful! Did you have insurance??
He sounds like he got really lucky. Id be pretty jealous of him if I were you.
Well thats not a very friend like thing to do.
THATS AMAZING what test was it?
algebra? WOW i love maths that sounds great i am so happy
Oh no what did you do?
Oh no!  Does he know you did it or did you never tell him?  Yeah we all have things we regret its how we move forward and resolve the situation that matters.
Wow that must of been such a great surprise.
Dang he should clean my house too then while i am gone.
No way! Congrats!!! I bet you feel really excited.  How long had you been developing it?
I bet 4 years is a long time to work on a project too.  I may not know you but as someone who had once wanted to get into development I feel really proud for you.  That is a huge accomplishment! Congrats again!
haha! I hear you! It helps if you have more money to save too!
Lol! Well that would be great. Give me some of that luck! 
Where are yours and whats going on withthem?
So sorry to hear that...wish you blessings and health and peace
that was so nice of her i bet you was so happy you much be very special to her
one day i wanted a rabbit and my mom got me one she told me not to feed it food and i gave it house food and it die lol
I guess neither do I sorry to hear about your rabbit though.
Yes its a good lesson for you hopefully you dont repeat it!
Your a pretty tough guy and you have the wits too dude. You got this.
Like i said you got this and going in with a positive mine you might as well take the world while your at it.
Aww thats sweet. I love animals! They love you unconditionally.
Uh oh someones in trouble! Its funny how smart dogs can be sometimes. They were trying to butter you up before you saw what they did!
Oh no I hope you didnt spend much on it 
Thats such a shame! I always hate getting let down 
Aw you must have felt really nostalgic in that moment. Sounds like a great memory.
I would highly suggest you do. Moms deserve all the love.
Ugh hate when that happens...do you live alone or with roommates
Man I woulda smacked him on the head...lol rotting fooddirty dishes are the worst
I hope it does.
wow thats horrible. what were they stealing?
thats horrible.  im glad they got caught
Thats cool. Sounds like youre an animal person
If you could..would you get a cat or a dog
I agree but maybe you should be a little less aggressive 
I dont know I just wouldnt be that aggressive. Id still try to protect her though
oh im sorry to hear that what caused this?
no one deserves this this is the worst thing that can ever happen im sorry to hear that 
Thats fantastic you must feel really confident in your ability.
Do you receive feedback often?
That must have been nostalgic. When did you last pick one up?
What a beautiful game hey?
Oh no!  Was it expensive items?
That is so awful.  I am so sad that happened to you.
Interesting! I could see how you thought that. Just because theyre homeless and have fallen on hard times doesnt mean theyre dumb. But yeah theres a good chance they did something wrong to be in that predicament so their judgment could be questionable. 
Youre right sorry for putting words in your mouth. And yeah I dont know how to engage with them either. As a college student there are plenty that kind of stalk the campus and ask for spare change. But I have little spending money so I always have to turn them down
Haha Im terrible with names too.  But for me there are only 2 types of people ones that are memorable and ones that are boring and if youre boring I definitely wont remember who the hell you are
Thats good.  Dont be so hard on yourself.  People should be begging for your attention. Not the other way around 
That is very lucky! Did you see who dropped it?
Oh wow! Lucky you!
Is everything going perfectly?
I get that! What show is it?
I have never heard of it I did watch the movie though. It would have been cool if they got Jennifer garner and Ben Afleck in it
Oh no! Was anything taken?
Youre very lucky!
We all have weeks like that. Dont be too hard on yourself. Everything will get done eventually.
That must be hard Im sorry. Just do what you can though. I would help if I could.
Thats great. Im sure it was cheaper than having to buy a brand new one.
I bet. The grass has been growing so fast right now. Your yard is going to look great again.
Oh my goodness! 3 months?! Where are you going?
That is amazing! What places do you want to visit the most?
That sounds like a great way to keep yourself motivated! 
Everyone needs some way to keep them going! 
What kind of job?
Well confidence is key so I bet you will get the job 
oh no how did it happen? were you in a hurry?
this is the worst i can understand why you are mad id be the same as you argh im sorry
Oh my that is tragic. I hope you are there to support him.
Good of you. Times like these can be tough and he needs all the support he can get.
That is pretty hard my dude. But join some clubs or get to know some people in your dorm area.
Also try joining a club you might end up in apartment with someone next year instead of the cramped dorms.
Do you trust other people at all?  It seems like it would be hard to trust someone if you think only you can know what is best for you.
Thats great.  It seems like you turned your life around.  It just seems like it would get lonely not being able to trust anyone.
how big is it ?
ah .. well i guess its not that bad yet
Did you think a bear was going to eat you?
Had you forgotten your pepper spray?
oh wow this is my passion too which EU country are you going to start first?
i have and i plan to travel the world in 12 years with my wife spain is amazing youre going to enjoy yourself i wish you the best
well atleast when you finish you can pop a beer and enjoy your hard work
hahaha yeah or go to a nice restaurant to feel relaxed after all that hard work
As reunions go I guess. How was it crazy?
Oh wow bet you felt guilty saying no!
Good for you.  We only get one body gotta take care of it best we can!
Yeah theres no escaping things that humans have chemically altered and we consistently put in our bodies.
lol. Well then darnit I want to be a unicorn.
lol Well thats true. Darn all those people who stopped me from being a unicorn. Well how on earth did you get back to earth then?
I am sorry to hear that.  Unfortunately a lot of dog breeds have a high risk of cancer.  Is it treatable?  
Oh my.  I have been in that situation before.  You have my sympathies.  
That sounds terrifying! I wouldnt want to stay alone either. That was nice you guys took her in.
I dont blame her. I am sure she felt more at ease staying with you guys.
that is not good why did you miss your sons game?
well if it is work then it is ok because you have to put food on the table first i can relate to that
Did you try to pick her up and take her outside?
You should try and use a toy or something to get her to chase dogs love those.
Why do you say used to be your favorite restueraunt?
Wow.. that really stinks that that happened to your favorite resteraunt 
Oh no! That is horrible! Did you get it back?
That must be so stressful. I am sorry.
Thats cool was it nostalgic? 
Yeah its crazy to think how long ago some things are
oh no thats horrible.  Im glad i didnt see that i wouldve been so upset
yea thats what I was thinking too.  poor doggy 
what time was it? please becareful with these kinds of things you were lucky and i am glad nothing happend but people dont realise how dangerous it is at night why were you out so late?
please becareful my friend had his phone stolen recently because of the same thing
That sounds wonderful! I bet it was amazing
Wow! I wish I could see something like that
That is very disgusting. I hope you complained!
That is nice. Sometimes things like this do happen but it is not something you like to see!
oh im so sorry please dont worry i know its tough but i learned that death is only a beginning not the end 
just like birth death is the start of another process unclear to us the unseen and i believe in this deeply your mother is fine she is always there
aww im sorry. thats always hard
I hope you are able to make some new friends.  Or keep in touch with video calls
A road trip sounds fun but I agree with you. I feel like I am a cab driver when people are on devices and not talking to me at all.
Yeah can you take turns driving?
Good luck with that its rough out there.
I hear ya. Perhaps they will though? gotta stay positive.
That could be embarrassing do you have a new partner?
Oh no lets hope shes up for some action with another girl.
Did he finish it all? 
What did the shirt look like?
oh god thats worse than thinking you lost your phone for a second i am aware of the feeling how are you feeling now
what did you learn?
Did you try to find who the 20 belonged to? 
I would feel guilty keeping money that I did not earn or that was not mine. Maybe you could give the 20 to charity?
Dang thats a nice honor. Shows you what he thinks of you. I would like someone to ask me to be their best man one day! Congratulations to the both of you
Oh yeah I forgot thats one of your responsibilities! Well you know your brother best so Im sure youll know what to do. But if you think he wont like the typical drunken debauchery stripper party dont do it just because its the thing everyone does. When my brother had his wedding we just sat around and played video games
Well its good that you are helping out your friend. Im sure he appreciates it.
Its good that you are making an effort. Thats more than a lot of people do. 
oh welcome to the long distance club! i am exactly in the same situation as you we are going on a cable car we are going to meet in 2 weeks and i also cant wait i feel you LETS HAVE  A BLAST
Yup i totally get you its same here and now it feels time is going super slow these next 2 weeks are going to be hell before i go to see her make sure you enjoy yourself!
Oh no! Thats sad
why was it amazing?
ah thats cool then
Thats really sad.  Im sorry to hear that.  Getting old stinks.  I feel bad when I see someone who seems really lonely
Yea thats hard.  You cant do anything now but maybe theres another neighbor that you can get close too 
That really is something to get excited about! Ive never been outside of the country so Im jealous of people that get the chance to. I hope youre able to get everything out of the trip that you want to
If I were you Id be the same way just counting down the days. I hope your travel goes smoothly. If youre going with someone special I hope you guys both enjoy your time there
That sounds really annoying i bet thats making a huge mess
Yea train her to push the stuff into the garbage can
Sorry to hear that. Maybe your luck will turn around soon!
I hope you werent too jealous of him! I hope you win next time.
Well if he was good at the trick its understandable. As long as you were a kid.
Wow you better let someone else do your due diligence you might fall victims to scammers.
Must be disappointing knowing the spark isnt there.
I guess as long as you are happy enough.
Im happy to hear that! That is a big step and he needs as much support as possible! 
I bet he feels so good about that its amazing to watch a big milestone!
that stinks im sorry.
our weather has been so extreme this year. its scary.
Thats awesome! What did they do?
That is really cool! You have some really great coworkers!
Thats good! Always smart to be prepared!
Yeah I always make sure to have things like bandaids or tape with me in case of emergencies.
Good for you how did it turn out?
At least you tried there are plenty of fish in the sea. Dont give up.
that sucks perhaps he should of be saving his money to pay for his apartment instead of having two dogs.
Well that was nice of you glad you took the dogs in.
That sounds very depressing.
You will for sure be next if it stays like that.
Have you gone to a doctor about it yet?
Well would you rather have it creep up on you out of the blue?
That sucks I imagine nothing ever became familiar to you.
Yeah a bit like how my employment goes.
oh my goodness. what did you do? are you alright?
i would have pulled into a public place or police station. im so sorry that happened to you but glad you are ok.
Do they live far away from you?
wow that is far.  I hope you guys use video chats
uhoh.  I hope it was ok.
ewww thats so gross.  I hope you didnt have to clean it up
that is awesome. stay positive i hope things will work out.
im so glad. marriage is tough but when you love each other its work the effort.
Oh really did you meet them from tinder
Try not to scare them away could be your last shot at love.
How did you celebrate after?
Whats your favorite alcohol to drink?
That is pretty awesome my dude.
Man that would of been cool but thinking about that was cool.
Did he get soaked?
Thats so cool! I would love to have a car like that!
Yeah I feel like we are living in a science fiction movie sometimes!
Thats so nice of them! Did you enjoy it?
I agree they must really love you a lot
Well did people  help you get cleaned off.
Hopefully you didnt miss the best part of the fair. That would be unlucky
I love when that happens!  I did the same thing not too long ago when I was in the area I grew up in.  
Yup!  It really makes you appreciate life!
Oh my I hope it was only a sincere error and not the charger being malicious
Ugh that must be so aggravating that you cant even get your money back. I would suggest calling and telling the manager.
As you should spitting in food is never the right answer. Hopefully you learned something from this.
Oh really? Did you go check it out?
Yeah I think I would have felt the same!
Why inspired you to do that?
I suppose if any car should be fit for such a task it would be a Tesla. 
Sorry to hear that! It must be infuriating to have that happen
Neither would I. Hopefully the other person is paying up for the damage at least
that is awesome. where is your home?
that is amazing. my mom never really cooked for us but she was a great mom. i bet you miss home.
What are they making you feel like?
Wow that seems bad. Why are you taking them?
oh really did you prepare it yourself.
well good thing you listened
That must have frightened you.  Was it the beef jerky sasquatch?
What is a potato camera?
Oh my how are you going to bathe and use the restroom?
As you should be! I think you need to call another plumber
Thats awesome. Do the people you work with know it?
I hope you get a raise soon
Thats great! What kind of car?
Good my son could be driving but he doesnt have a car to drive or the real need to. He likes to walk to places
Oh no ! Did she offer to replace the cost of the plants at least ?
Oh thats quite understandable then ! I try to never let small things overcome a good relationship with friends 
I am scared of those things too.  Where did you go?
I dont blame you one bit!
Nice! Always good to go on a date and celebrate your love.
Oh! Sorry to hear that! Will you get a divorce now?
Oh man that stink. I bet you will find someone though.
Yeah weve all felt that at some point in life. 
It must be such an exciting time for her and your family!
Get a nice gift for her to let her know how happy you are for them!
Do you think you have pushed your self enough or are you worried? 
Great I wish you all the lucky in the world.
Wow you must be pretty old did you have indoor plumping 
Well that sounds pretty fun It must have been nice to grow up during the 60s
Thats aweful! What do they do?
Your boss. How do they take advantage of you?
why did you not get your raise?
that stinks. i know how that feels.
Thats awesome. Was it worth it?
I hope you got plenty of photos?
that is awesome.
i really wish i would be able to do so well in math
What is your goal weight?
I love horses what other sports do you play?
Did she appreciate it?
Thats amazing I would love to have some today.
What was chasing you?
I bet your friends were laughing the whole time!
Why are you angry did you sister get unfairly fired?
Sounds like in the long run they will all end up fired if they dont get their money right
Thats great. Its good that you have a support network like that. 
Are you always alone?
I can imagine. Why dont you take a lyft or uber?
A walking buddy then? they should be free.
Thats great. Is it his first year?
Wow how exciting has he been practicing a lot? 
Its definitely not fair. It seems almost as if people do not TRY to create a friendship or are playing both ends of the candle to see which bargain plans per friends are better and then make a choice
Yes true friends understand and will work around your schedule and wont put you off or make you feel like you have done something wrong.  
Sorry to hear that. My parents used to struggle with health issues too and Id worry just as much as they would. Do you know when it may be rescheduled for?
It sounds like youre patient and prepared to take it. I wish the best for you guys!
That is good. What are some of your favorites?
Those are really cool traditions.
thats cool. what kind of job did you apply for?
that would be amazing. i hope it works out for you.
Thats awesome! Why are you proud of her?
Good for her. Its great that she is pursuing her dreams!
What happened to your grama?
Im sorry to hear that were you close?
Sounds pretty tough
That is awful. I hope you are okay!!!
Im so sorry that happened to you. It must have been so scary.
Well you must be very lucky then.
Things seem to go in cycles sometimes you just got to make it through the other side.
Wow how fast were you going?
That can happen to anyone though. It was speeding but at least it wasnt wreckless driving!
That is awesome. What is your future endeavor comprised of ?
Thats quite the diverse field ! My son changed that major because it has too much Math involved. He graduated with an Infomatics degree
What is he doing?
Cant you report him?
Wow thats exciting! What are you planning on majoring in?
Thats a very interesting field. Are you nervous?
Much luck to you!
What was tempting you?
Yes that sounds quite hard!  Good for you for being faithful though!
What went right last?
Wow where are you working? Thats amazing.
I do too! Have you had a specific situation lately?
That sucks. You cant really get away from that situation. Maybe look for a new job?
Im sure youll be fine if you study enough!
Excellent I hope so
I hate when that happens. Its such a bummer!
Im sorry. You should go out and enjoy yourself and rub it in their face!
Oh thats really cool. Was it from your childhood?
Well I think its really good you found such a cool think from your childhood
Thats good wish my brother was like that.
Man that just makes me jealous some.
How likely is he to go ape shit?
You may want to replace that beer. lol
Oh yeah I have seen those kind of micro bikes before. Takes some skill I suppose.
Maybe thats all he could spare for. Still got to stunt whenever possible. 
Yep I like them too. Especially Frozen.
Oh yea that movie was one of my favorites when I was a child
I love cats did you punish her?
Oh thats awesome. Finally ready for the baby? 
I see. Thats a long time. I wish you the best of luck this time!
that is so stinking awesome
it will be an adrenaline rush for sure
Are you not able to make ends meet right now?
Thats a good attitude to have!  Stay strong!
I would never be able to do that!
Stay on the ground my friend.
Thats great! What do you have planned?
That does sound like a lot of fun!
That had to be a weird feeling.  How was it?
I can imagine.  Ive never been back to mine but i can still picture in my mind what it looks like
Uh oh! I would hate that 
Thats always got to be the worst thing to deal with
Oh yeah? What is the exam for? I hope you do well.
Oh man I always found calculus to be really tough. Im glad you seem confident. 
Thats awesome.  Make sure you wear sunscreen.  Dont want to get burned
I need some time off of work too.  Maybe I should take a vacation!
Uh oh. A little too much to drink?
That is about as bad as it can get right there. I think you might have to tell her. The guilt will eat you alive.
Wow he must have been hungry as hell.
oh it was one of those chalenges things?
how are you doing now ?
yea thats good though that you are moving forward
Damn was it a bogus call or what
Well I hope youll have a better ref next time...just keep hustling
I agree they think theyre so smart but they are not!
Exactly you got it they will make their mistakes.
I know the feeling.  I wish i could go back to being little again
yea and I didnt have to go to work!
What was the bad thing about it?
Man that does sound scary! I hope that it didnt follow you home!
Thats great! He sounds like a good addition in your life.
Awe I love my dog too shes really sweet. Well except my dog doesnt listen so I guess your dog beats mine lol.
Are you jealous of them?
That sucks i just had a massive meal myself.
Hopefully you do well with it!
You will get in and do great things!
ohno what did you have? what was bad about it?
ewww that sounds disgusting.  I would have complained
That was really nice of you. Did you find it?
Well keep looking and maybe check the local animal shelters if you havent already.
Thats pretty compassionate of you!
Do you have any pets of your own? you sound like an animal person
Good times indeed!  Those were the days.  It seems cliche to say they were simpler times because I remember them saying that back then about when they were younger.  History repeats itself.
When I think of Christmas with families I tend to think about National Lampoons Christmas Vacation.  A classic.
how come? is everything alright?
that would be great. im hoping all goes well with you.
I hope everything goes well! What are you worried about?
Well I hope that it is nothing serious. 
I hope he does!
Wow. I wish something like that would happen to me. That is so cool.
Maybe you can pay it forward next time you see someone buying a drink.
Are you sure they were werewolves and not regular wolves?
when is the beat down scheduled for and how can i help?
no no we need revenge. think about it and let me know
I think that way too!
If you expect the worst you wont be disappointed. 
Hate when that happens...if it happens more than once you can file a complaint with the city council
Or next time stand in the garbagemans way at your neighbors to confront him about it haha
who? is everything alright?
oh my goodness im so sorry. i really hope she comes back soon
Do you have a plan made up?
I think you can do this Im proud of you.
Whats your first step in the plan to get back on track?
I love Nintendo I use to play every time.

Is the friend a female?
Should you be worried?
Oh shoot! Thats never fun. Did you get a ticket?
That was very lucky!
Dammmnn is your cat ok??

You sound like youd be a good therapist.
Its been to be humble than rude or mean thats my motto.
Thats great that you had such a good time. You sound like a good parent!
That really is. When I comes down to it what a kid wants most from a parent is love. 
Oh no! Why are you worried about that?
Well it is good that you are prepared. It is always important to have extra supplies in case of an emergency. 
Whoa!  I saw his initial performance and was blown away!  That must have been amazing to see!
That is good news!  Im sure you will look forward to it as will I
Oh no!  I remember doing something similar when I was younger.  There was a pool outside of our screen door.  I went to run and jump into the pool from in the house and smashed right through it!
Gotta roll with it!  Just play it off at that point.

Yeah its going to be great!

Oh no Ive never had a cat because my husband and brother are allergic. Is she trying to mark her terriorty?

Im more of a dallas fan myself.
We will for sure win this year!
It sure is.  It is an important step in this road we call life.
And now he can focus on the next phase of his life.  Which should be exciting

That is a strange scenario. Do you live in chicago.
Oh wow yeah that is a pretty terrible place. Your should get out.
Nice. What was his first day?
How it went for hime? Did he cry?
I would be so frustrated.  Do you have any way to make him do the necessary fixes?
I dont blame you!  It might cost more to sue than to break the lease and move.
I wish you the most success.
That sounds really good! Im kind of jealous1
What kind of cheesecake are you thinking of eating?
Oh no. Whats wrong? Why are you going?

Good.  Its important that we all feel satsified with our situations.
Well I hope nothing changes and you stay happy forever!
Ive never been into pokemon but my brother is a big fan. When does the game come out?
Thanks! Maybe I will get it for his birthday in November. I will have to look into it.
You should use it as fuel and keep going.
Then you need something to motivate you. Try watching the Rocky II
Are you leaving on a jet plane?  I am guessing you are going on vacation?
Nice.  I love Florida.  What part of the state are you going to?
You could have gone to a bar and found some friends 
Thats what the alcohol is for lol
Oh wow I hope you are save did you have to evacuate to a shelter or to family house away?
Glad you and your family is safe and lets just hope the storm passes by and cause no damage to home town.

Oh no were you able to get into you work ?
Im sure you will not be the first or the last to lose one of those.  My husband has lost his a few times as well.  Hopefully its a simple process to get a new one made.
Oh Im sure thats a bit boring have you had fun stuff to do?
Im sorry to hear that. If your neighborhood is rough take precautions otherwise maybe try to find a tea or something to help sooth.
Lucky! I love when that happens! 
Yum sounds like a good use of the money! Hopefully you find some more spare money haha
I imagine that was a pleasure that was simple at one time but one you really appreciated when you came back. Thanks for your service!
Absolutely! It can often take really significant events to happen before we realize it too. 
That sucks I hope you found your dog.
What a bummer. Landlords suck for the most part. 
Do you have a lease?
I understand. Me too I dont like people talking too much.
Are you still seeing him?
Did he give her a haircut?
How long did you live her with him for?
Oh no. Did the waitress realize it before you left?
I see. Well if you go there again be sure to leave her a bigger one!

Thats interesting I havent seen a good magic show in a while.
Very cool I hope more people continue to recognize his talent and he gets the acclaim he deserves.

Yes it is.  You should take her out to dinner or something to say thank you.
Happy birthday! Did you have fun?
That sounds like a lot of fun. You have some pretty great coworkers!
I know how that is. What happened?
That is so sad. I have dealt with something similar. Good luck!
Ive been there. It gets old real quick.
Just try and keep a low profile and stay busy. 
How did she get them if they were sold out?
Wow thats awsome man. Who are you seeing?
That sounds horrible and scary
What did you do after
Aw I hate it when that happens but I bet the relative understands.  Sometimes things come up.
Theyve probably been on the other side of this situation before.
Sounds fun!  Where ya headed to?
Oh cool.  Sounds like fun!  Be safe!
Are you excited for them
That sounds like a good year to me
Thats awesome! What are you going to study?
Thats really cool! Good luck!

Definitely Id look to move on if I was you.
I love me some pumpkin pie whats she going through?
Im sorry to hear that I love animals. I hope she cheers up.
Are you nervous about which schools you might get accepted for or do you feel good about it?
Oh wow yeah you should have no problem! I did just fine with way worse than that.
I bet that is a great achievment! Loosing weight is hard! Keeping it off is even harder. 
You can do it! Keep up the hard work 
You sound inspirational my friend.
Where are you living your dream out at?
Sry to hear that....what happened
Hey well I bet youre talented at other things...just stack your paper and youll have the last laugh
Did your boss tell you why?
Oh so it was a positive thing...thats great well I hope you enjoy your mini vacation 
Um you seem really upbeat and happy!
Are you really excited about somthing going on in your life?
That sucks so much. I hope there isnt any tension between you and your friend.
I hope you can both work it out it would be awful for a friendship to end over something like that.
What happened to him
That sounds very painful. I am sure they were glad you came with them
That is very good news. It means that you are doing a great job.
What are you planning to do with the money?
I love Halloween what is horrors night?
Thats fun do the ghosts chase you around?
Ah you arent a big fan of tomatos?
Yes if you requested no tomato you should get a refund!

Whats your favorite kind of cake flavor
Ice ice baby widen your horizons maybe cant identify with the girl or guy who shys away from chocolate cake bh u craayy

You should turn the lights on!
Did you call him to complain about that?
Thats awful my air conditioner is cleaned thankfully. 
Im right there with you!  That is the best thing in the world! Are you there now?  Im talking to my husband about moving to the beach permanently.
Im so jealous!  I havent been in years now!  Breathe in the salt air for me!
You must be a savior to him is he paying you for that?
Very true I hope he knows how lucky he is.
Have you been working hard in the off season?
You sound very confident. Sounds like you put in the work. Good luck.
That is great how do you think you did?
Congratulations that is so awesome to have passed such a intense exam.
Uh oh! Are they picky?
Thats not cheap at all! 
Are you gonna complain to someone about it?
I am sorry to hear that then...
I understand. I had the same feeling. When did she passed away?
How old was she when she passed away?
good stuff you picked a good time to do it!
wow that is pretty soon it snuck up on me
Me too!  I used to be able to watch some when I was younger but then I realized I was torturing myself because I hate them!
I agree.  They literally haunt you forever.
oh that makes sense. why yesterday then?
Oh I am sorry to hear that. You must have been close to her.
Yes at least you have those memories of her to cherish and hold forever.
I get that but money talks at the end of the day
That is what it comes down to sometimes!
That is always tough to deal with.  Time can help but it cant get you over the loss of a loved one.
I agree.  Things can always get better just remember her and honor her the best that you can.
I can imagine so! I bet you are one tired person when you hit the bed at night!
I hope you do! I really wish you the best.
I bet that will be fun. Do you do that a lot
I need to game more when I can
Well with what?
Well best of luck!
Thats awesome!   What does she do?
Thats amazing!  What a commendable job!  Good for her!
Wow I love nintendo you should get an NES classic!
I am so sorry to hear it! 
Hopefully you can go back and get it! 
That sounds like a lot of fun! What were some of your favorite games to play?
That is really cool. Its nice that you could rediscover a bit of your childhood. 
Thats great news. Where you expecting it?
Well that is great. Sounds like you really deserved it.
Thats a rip off at that price.
Did you ever try netflix? Its great.
wow. thats kind of cruel
What is that game about
That sounds really fun I am sure it will be good
that is good it has been hot here recently
that is good cherish that stuff while it lasts!
That is very nice to have someone providing support
Good. It is important to be open about all subject. Is she accepting it?
Did you tell him about it or no?
You should tell him he will like you for it.
Aww dangit!  Maybe hell let you drive it
And then just keep driving and dont take it back lol
I have been there. It is nice to have those memories
i get that I have one coming up as well
just stay calm and collected talk slowly gather your thought
That is so awesome. I hope you show them how grateful you are.
Well I am sure you deserve it. Just take real good care of it.
That is great you should follow up with them in a few days.
I was going to ask if it was for a manager that is awesome you got this they will be hiring you on the spot.
I have.  It was a long time ago.  I had a lot of fun watching it with my daughter but I always feel sad for the animals until I found out that the circus I went to helps injured animals have a home.
Yes!  Im very much against animal cruelty but not every circus is bad thankfully.  Do you love the circus?
Did you see the person that got shot when it happened?
Oh no! Are they just scared?
Im so happy for her! Hopefully everything goes well for her
Oh no Im sorry man. Hopefully next time. Were you at least able to reach out and see what you could improve upon? 
I bet that is pretty disappointing. Maybe some ice cream will make you feel better.
You are saying it as if its a bad thing are you left without friends?
My friend just stay strong family and kids can suck you life awaynot always of course.
I guess you got an A?
Well done what other exams are left?
Where have you been traveling
Oh that sounds very exotic
Maybe you can catch up on some sleep?
I know it will feel lonely but a good weekend to recharge will do some good.
Are yall gonna go on a date?
what is the dinner?
Yum!!!!! I literally just watched a recipe on how to make a vegan chocolate cake so Im craving one!  With tons of icing!
Yum! Have a piece for me!!
Yeah that must have been a trip down memory lane.
Well you are one of the lucky ones then
I bet he would be proud
It will always be a nice reminder then
You got some good new? 
I cant think of better way to have fun with friends. Sounds like a great time.
I understand. He need to rest and take a nap.
You should. Thats not nice
well i hope you learned your lesson
Health is truly a blessing! How old are your children? 
I agree. I cant imagine what it must be like to be a parent and go through that. 
Eww! I really hate olives also. What things do you like in your salad?
Im just a plain salad person but I do like my bacon bits and croutons in a salad. Also some carrots.
That is very tense to be waiting on that kind of call you got this positive thoughts only. What position is it for?
Just be patient you aced it and you will get that position and call soon. 
Ohhhh sophomore year can be tough. How do you feel about that?
Wow. Hes taking on quite a lot but itll be good for building his character as he gets older!
Oh thats awesome!   Congrats!!
I hope its a baby!!!! Good luck!
Oh wow how were you doing that? 
Im sorry you feel bad about it now. Im not really sure what I can say its not like you can change the past. You could try volunteering. 
Why so interestin?
I know the feeling. Do you huys get to talk?
Why was it not a good day? What happened?
Oh Im so sorry to hear that.  My father in law had to have hospice and although its not what you want to hear the people that work with hospice are really a lifeline for the family.
That sounds like a lot of fun I have never been to one before.
I may to check one out. I like trying out new places.
What kind of test is it
oh yea what is the meeting about ?
oh that sounds interesting good luck
I have seen them eat bigger
Why that response?
Yes the lines are a pain.
What was the news?
Thats so tragic did the doctor say what happened?
Have you been studying for it?  I hope you do well.
Then hopefully you will do really well on it.  Its normal to be a bit apprehensive before a big test though.
Really where is that?
Well at least you are not in the middle of the flight.
Very wise of you experiences are all that matters.
I see but you do realize that happiness for the most part is immaterial right?
Do you feel guilty now?
How are you going to make up for it?
What a nice surprise. What was the card for?
What is limiting your ability to visit?
Dont be its a destructive emotion. 
Isnt it grand I bet we no very little authentic information about them.
I bet they are much older than we believe them to be.
I would be sad about that! Im so sorry
Did you finally get it working ?
Is doctor pepper your favorite?
Thats awful sorry to hear that. I love me some Sprite.
Thats awesome. How was the first day for him?
oh wow i wish i could go there do you plan to return one day ?
that is something i hope to do one day as well. good luck
Thats the best way to go in to an interview. How do you think it went?
Oh congratulations! What kind of job? 
I am so sorry. It happens to everyone and no one is ever prepared for it
Thats the only bad thing about having animals you are going to outlive them
Is you cat ok now? What do you think it is?
Most likely. They can be skittish little things.
Thats awesome!  Congrats!!
Wow!  Thats a long hard battle!  Poor little kitty
Which amusement park?
Roller coasters are fun but you should stay safe too.
What other rides should you take?
Thats one thing I dont miss is having someone stay above me did they dog make lots of noise?
That is so rude and disgusting I know you was a tad bit furious. 
That would make me SO angry. What kind of drugs is it? I would make sure the police took him out.
Well I have the same issue..they arent afraid..theyre just corrupt..but I just yell at those people myself. I dont put up with the ghetto corrupt crap
Is he a pervert?
Thats great!  Did she move recently?  Do you miss her?
Im sorry.  That can be so tough when youre used to her being so close.  Did she move far away?
wow. Where are you going?
omg. that is going to  be so nice
It is good to have someone that can provide support. Do you have a depression?
It is very nice from her.
Are you disappointed with it?
I feel like you should take it up with him.
I cant imagine how much that hurts.. I would be so sad.
It always hurts more when its unexpected. Hopefully time heals.
Where are you vacationing too?
I love the heat youre going to be melting up in Florida though.
I can only do about 5 dont feel bad do you try them often? 
If you practice everyday you will get better I was the same way.
I love seafood! What kind of seafood dishes? 
Awesome! Cooking can be pretty hard and its an essential skill to have.
what is bugging you today
you didnt get an invite ?
Oh did you have plans after work?
So sorry you had to miss it maybe take him out to ice cream to console him
Thats fantastic. It always feels good inside when you make a good impression. 
That would be so nice for you. I really hope it works out. 
Cool whats truffle oil got to do with mac and cheese?
Oh okay that sounds good
Oh yeah me too! Even though it makes me a little nervous to think about it.
Thats a good idea. Id feel better doing it that way at least the first time.
Thats great your hardwork totally payed off
Stay positive and keep up the good work!
That sounds like fun! Which amusement park?
In that case more terrifying than fun. I hope you find rides youll enjoy and not fear!
Oh thatss nice
Mine too. I love the trees in fall
What did she or he do lately?
Do you plan on arguing to him about it?
I didnt even know that was a thing. Im sorry
uh Ive heard way too many people experience that. Why dont people just not hit you in the first place if they dont want to take responsibility?
I really wish those people who get fined just like those traffic cameras that send you tickets in the mail for speeding. It would really reduce hit and runs.
Wow I wish I could make a change like that!
Long time but Im sure very beneficial
what kind of cake cake cake?
oh you try baking it with the cherries on already ? its great
That sounds like a lot of fun! Who ya going with?
Very nice! I bet your more than excited about it!
Oh no! Dont be anxious or worried! Im sure you did good on the application. 
Have more confidence in yourself! Take pride in your work! 
what did you try?
yea it looks gross
Oh that sounds delicious!  I bet you could do it!
Did that guy finish it?  Did he get an award of any kind? 
Thats rude. Do it they do that often?
You should definitely talk to them about that.
I love fried rice
Oh. I am the same with lemon icebox pies and my grandmother
It is very nice from him. Until what time did you work?
It should very hard to work that late.
It happens sometime. Just try not to forget next time.
Eek! Sounds pretty scary! I hate to be alone at night. 
Yeah pretty creepy. Turn on some music or something so you dont get too nervous or anxious. 
Headaches really suck Im so sorry to hear that. Any idea why youve been getting bad ones?
It could be. Also may be related to dehydration and eye strain related to visual problems. Try and drink more water and have your eyes checked to be sure!
That sounds exciting what kind of restaurant is it?
OO that sounds snazzy!  Perhaps that will also mean bigger tips!  I hope you do amazing on your interview with them.
She must be so excited! How long will you guys be there for?
Wow. Thats a lot of places. Sounds fun!
Im sorry to hear that. Whats got you feeling so tired?
Being a parent really is a thankless job until your kids get older and realize how tough it is.
Wow your dog is that cats hero!
I bet your dog is pretty smart. I mean she was able to notice a cat in danger and helped out and all.
I dont understand why people just dont break up. Why cheat?
People are just so inconsiderate sometimes. Even if you dont love the person anymore at least treat them like someone you used to love.
Oh no! Im sorry. Im sure your excited now!
Oh no! IM glad your no longer feeling hungry. I bet your content with it now
Oh man! That would scare the heck out of me 
Would that even change anything?
i only do that at the seafood buffet.
I used to work at a buffet lol. Youre not the only person who over ate at a buffet before
That sounds delicious do you know how to make it now?
You sound like a great parent. you should pass down the recipe to your kids too
Wow why stay with him for so long if she was going to say no?
Yeah man that sucks
Tell him he owes you one now. Cant just be taking peoples ice cream.
Oh man now I want some ice cream.
Oh.  What happened?
Oh thats amazing!!! What did you name her?
She wont remember that for much longer.
I would be too does she live in a bad neighbourhood?
Thats smart you sound like a good sibling to her
It will happen eventually. Enjoy being single while you can.
It will come to you when you least expect it! Until then enjoy yourself!
Oh no people are so reckless.
I hope it isnt too expensive to have repaired.
Yea? Howd it go?
Thats amazing! Congratulations!
Do you feel more lonely?
You should consider getting some new roomies.
I assume that this job turned out to be the complete opposite of what you expected?
Im so happy to hear that! Often many people find themselves stuck at jobs they hate and it isnt healthy.
How long have you had your cat? Mine used to be like that.
ah a little old lady. Has she always ignored you?
Oh does she feel weird about that? Where does she work?
Yeah hopefully they will hire more women soon
Oh no.  Did something happen?
Yikes!!  I bet that was scary!
oh cool did it get the job done ?
Reeboks? Save your jealousy lol
I have like 20 pairs of converse lol. I love them
Where are you meeting her?
You should try to get on tinder.
I wish I could be broke doing something as cute. Seriously thats awesome in a way.
I know how you feel. Theres a rabbit that lives under my shed and I try and feed it. 
That makes two of us! Big old baby dogs are the cutest though.
Ah pets. What could we do without them?
Yeah and its not too far away from halloween now
I went to one and I kicked a ghost because it tried to grab me haha
Did you discipline him?
Awe is it too warm out? Keep him inside more.
Did you not like the person?
What is she doing to boys?
Wow thats no good at all do you have any idea how to fix it?
Thats awesome. When will you get your results?
Have you started?
Man. I should start too.
That is a good friend but Im sorry you tore your pants.  Why were you climbing a fence?
Well at least your friend was there to help you out.  Maybe you should have picked up a sewing kit at the grocery store to try to fix the jeans also  LOL!
What do you plan on doing while youre alone?
You are an inspiration to me. I need to hit the gym.
lol is he younger or older?
Ouch thats awful!  Did you get it back yet?
Sheesh.  How much was it?
Thats bad Im sorry 
Are you switching jobs? Does the new one offer more money?
Ahh maybe you can ask your boss for a raise instead? Haha
Oh did you? What happened?!
uh oh when was the last time you checked your weight before this?
Thats awesome. You must have trained really hard.
Thats great dedication! I just know it will go well!
Nice! I bet your excited about it. I love trying new places. 
Yes it is! Thats sounds disappointing but Im glad you found a new place you will hopefully like. 
Yikes maybe its time to switch banks
Oof are they even allowed to do something like that?
That is bad. You should have immediately gotten a towel and dry yourself. You could get sick
Did you spend the whole day with wet clothes at work? Didnt the manager allow you to go home and change?
I hope you studied for it!
Thats great! I hope you do well on your exam! Reward yourself after too
Well I think that all depends on where youre eating and how much you eat. Do you think youre eating anywhere unhealthy?
Mine too. Whenever I go I tend to get 10 happy meals. Gotta get all those toys!
Oh god. Did anyting get stuck on your car?
Wow. Would have drove that car straight through the car wash.
Nice! Where are you going to go? 
That sounds like a very romantic destination. I wish you the best of luck.
Oh no! Whats taking you so long. Are you having sentimental moments?
I know it can be upsetting and emotional but Im sure you are happy!
haha thats awesome!  Congrats to him!
LOL they sure do!  Do they have any babies yet?
Oh yea? Where ya headed?
The beach is awesome. Have fun!
What things are you wanting to go as planned?
Very true I am sure those instructions are forth coming.  He wouldnt leave us hanging.
I cant even imagine what would make them ban certain dogs to begin with
Ive heard that fear makes people do all sorts of crazy things.
I admire people who can care for dogs i can barely take care of myself!
I was only 18 when my daughter was born had no idea what i was  getting into!!!
Does he get anything else?
Oooh that doesnt sound great but at least hes not causing any trouble. Its hot outside everyone needs some clean water
Hmm..I think weve all been there one time or another.  Are you going to admit it?
Well you certainly dont want that hanging over your head for the rest of your life.  It sounds like you have a good moral outlook on life I think you have to admit it.
Oh no! Why did you cancel? Thats the best time to go!
Thats a really good reason to do so. Wouldnt want his mom getting any sicker with no one around.
You should go for it! How long have you known her?
thats cute you guys will be very happy together I think
You should totally go!
If theres a time to treat yourself its definitely on your birthday!
Im so sorry! I bet your very sad right now!
Im sorry to hear this. Times like this can be terrifying but you can get through it. 
Why did you decide to tell your mom you washed it?
Thats okay sometimes little white lies like that wont harm anyone!
Oh my god thats so sad to hear. How is he holding up?
Aw cheer up friend. Its rough now but it will get better! Maybe you two should go to the pet store to try and find a new dog for him!
Me either so rude! It happens too often. 
Yeah people who do that have zero self awareness.  
Thats so great! You guys have been able to stay close after so long! You must be very compatible with each other
Amazing! I wish I had some friends like that in my life
I know what you mean!  Ive been homeschooling my girls forever it seems and my oldest graduates this spring.  Im ready to be done with school too  LOL!
Oh no. How long will he be away for?
Maybe you can get him on Skype or something?
Oh no! Did you look in the places youve been all day?
Thats so sad. I hope your spouse wont be too upset with you.
Do you pull it up?
That wouldnt be good.
Were you in a tight spot? How much did you borrow?
What a good friend to lend you money in your time of need. You should thank him and take him to dinner after everything is sorted.
Did you perform well?
Dont worry. Youll get good score.
OH man! I bet you were overwhelmed! did you stay faithful to her?
Thats good! I would of been anxious to get out of that place if that happend. 
Oh no! Why are you nervous?
What topics will the exam be covering?
I hope so too! Do you know if he is planning on proposing anytime soon?
Bah he should just do it already! In the wise words of the late Rhiana If you like it you should put a ring on it.
How come? Were you scared of the dark?
Oh no! Did your parents check your closet before tucking you into bed?
Oh no! I know car problems can be frusterating. 
I hear ya. Stay hopefull. It will come soon with dertermination. 
I agree. Im sure you will find something. I get anxious for new things as well. 
Awesome!  Cute kitties!  Did you feed them
Yeah.  you can always take them to the shelter or post on FB if someone wants to adopt them!
Wow. Thats pretty amazing. So many people break up so easily.
Shes a lucky gal!
These people are becoming so pathetic and out of touch with reality that logic and reasoning are becoming an aliens to them
People at CNN and the whole liberal media who ignore the reality of the peoples lives and try to project their own moral wonderland onto them
Then be as prepared as you can.
Why do you feel bad?
Oh. Im sure she didnt mind it. Dogs seem to be a lot less sensitive than people. 
Very good! I bet your anticipating a good turn out!
Well you prepared really well. I feel you will do well on this test!
Where did you lie? Im on a new diet that Im really happy with
Yeah I know its time for us to get healthy!
I love Canada do you speak French?
Where did you grow up?
That is a miracle.
I hope you make sure the dog is on a leash from now on.
It will be here before you know it.  Are you a big Georgia fan?
Wow that is exciting.  The first game of the season is always the best one. 
oh congratulations to your friend!
I wish them the best! Have fun at the wedding!
Ooh where are they going?
Wow I have a friend that went there for school too!
Being nervous is totally understandable. They chose you so they definitely think you can do it!
Hey youll be going up that ladder and will be looking back at how much youve accomplished one day.
Oh no! Have you gone up to check if theres a leak? 
Oh gosh yeah be careful...I hope it stops raining soon  
That sounds scary! Has your place been broken into?
What did they take from you?
Oh no I hope you find him.
Hes probably just gone on holiday Im sure he will come back with gifts.
What was the prize?
Did you keep the pen or sell it?
Oh no Did you lose it?
Thats good. Glad ya got it back!
Its good. Do you prepare him that ?
Its lovely. Whats her name?
I am so sorry to hear that. Do you have a job? Where do you work that you could not make even a rent payment?
So where are you spending your nights? Are there any homeless shelters provided by the social services?
Nice you must look like The Hulk.
I run every day.
Itll take some getting used to. Keep at it!
Are you a hockey fan?
Thats great! I also have a cat shes so precious
A couple years shes a persian mix
Oh no you should buy her a new one!
Im sorry    I bet she got upset
Then why are you excite about it?
Oh I didnt know that was really happening.
So does that mean she isnt chubby now? Or still chubby but grew into it?
Thats good to hear. So did you match with her on tindr or something?
Nice! Is it a fancy One?
Very nice! Were you excited to drive it?
Im sorry to hear that.  You should have some friends over.  Throw a party and catch up on old times.
Yeah its always good to hang out with friends.  That cheers me up when Im down.
That is awesome was he scared of you?
me too Im long overdue to go to the dentist
ugh I know I just keep putting it off nasty root canal
No. What is it?
What is it about
Why did you guys get divorced?
Well then it seems like it was a good choice.  Next time around you will know more what to look for before getting married.  I hope you find someone that matches up better with you.
Did you like living with your Dad?
That was very kind of her.
oh no! I bet your so sad right now. im sorry for your loss
I know it can be upsetting and sad but take your time. It will be ok. 
Thats awful Im sorry. Does she want to be with the other guy instead of you?
I hope it all works out with you and your girlfriend.
Nice movie! I bet you had a fun and joyful time watching it. 
Nice! How exciting. 
Hey me too!  What are you working on?
No I meant I hope you get the funding.  Sounds interesting!!
Yikes! Yall need another new printer 
That can be tough. I hope everything is okay.
Good luck with it all.
Oh no!  Im so sorry we just went through that with our pup.  Its a hard choice to have to make.
Im sorry you are having to make that choice but I feel its our duty to them to help them pass on when they are not going to get better and help them not suffer any longer.
Once but it burned the wall so my mom got rid of it
Thats so sad. What do you think about that?
It might be best to send him then. On the bright side you will still be able to visit him and I am sure hell be taken care of very well.
I agree. Its frusterating especially when it was an important conversation. 
How annoying. Dont pay them now mind! do your own thing
Yum! I have never had it. I bet you enjoyed it!
Maybe I should try it out! It will be exciting to do so. 
Oh yeah I can relate.  I always get uneasy before a big test.  And I always end up cramming and studying the last minute.
Well as long as you know the basic concepts and material and have it fresh in your mind for tomorrow you should do fine.  I find I always worry and end up doing better than i expected.
I cannot stand that!  Did this happen to you recently?
Did you say anything to the waitress? Ive always wanted to but never have.  My husband tells me not to say anything because then they will spit on my food.
Beautiful! You must be so proud!
Thats such a great idea! Dance is a great exercise for kids.
Thats sounds like a lot of fun! What did you guys do?
I am glad yall had a blast. Its always good to spend some quality time with the fam.
Did you have fun there by yourself at least?
You should have joined one of the other groupls and pretended to belong.  See who wouldve said something first.
Me too! Gouda is my all time fav. Whats yours?
Oh yeah a good mozzarella sounds pretty primo right now. Perhaps Ill get some mozz sticks from Little Caesars.
Whoo! What trick was it? How old is he?
So cute! You must be so proud! You should teach him more tricks!
Could there be a reason that he is?
It must be frustrating! How are you gonna go about doing it?
Fun! You guys got to spend a lot of time together?
Did he pass? At least you got to appreciate him and show him your love
I agree! How annoying that is!
I was of been furious as well. How could they ruin a nice day!!
Wow that is a long time. How did you keep it together that long?
I was hoping for an easier way but I guess like all worthwhile things hard work is key
Oh what show?
hm mustve been a really controversial show.
Oh me too! What do you love about it?
If only it was Christmas all year long hu?
How exciting!  What kind of restaurant to you want to open?
That sounds amazing! We need a Korean restaurant in our town I would love for one to open here!
Thats so sad. Did she live a happy and fulfilled life?
Thats so nice! Perhaps you should dwell on good memories like that of her to rid yourself of your sadness. We have to remember the good times with our loved ones!
Oh I bet!  Did you take him outside?
I use puppy pads in my house in case my dog needs to use the bathroom in the house.   Those seem to work pretty good!
oh wow nice! its never too late.
makes me think what am i doing to reach my goals today?!
Thats great news! You must be excited!
Oh gosh. Wonder why she wont be upfront about it.
You must be so proud and happy! What a young athelete in the making
Wow! Sounds like he was the MVP of the team!
Tornadoes can be so terrifying. My house was swept up by one when I was a little kid. But I guess it was okay since I ended up meeting a talking scarecrow a tin man and a big ole lion.
It is indeed! It was all swell and dandy until the darn flying monkeys swooped in. That really put a damper on things.
Oh my! What did she do?
Wow she sounds like an awful person. I feel bad for her son for not being able to get his car.
I bet your excited about it!
I bet you anticipate it to be good like usual!
Im sorry to hear that. Maybe you can find a similar place around you!
How long have you been waiting for? Hang in there.
Thats awesome. 1 year down. Keep at it buddy.
hahaha I have not heard that from many people.
I know! Then you get to the bowling alley try to do what they do end up getting 3 gutter balls in a row and fall flat on your butt to boot!
Me and you both friend. We can always try and have a blast though! Im sure if we keep at it well get a turkey in a century or two.
Ugh are you nervous about it?
Thats great to hear. Your confidence will no doubt help you tomorrow.
How did that go? Studying is very important in order to do good. 
How annoying that could be. She could have alittle more respect for you. 
How frustrating! I hope you were able to study just a little though.  
Im sorry man! stay optimistic! dont be sad about it. 
You should definitely change roommates. I had been through such experience and know how more difficulty he can bring. Stay away from irresponsible people
Dont get emotional with him and dont let anger to ruin your relationship with him. Just distance yourself from him. That is it
That really stinks. Is there any way youll be able to keep up with him to ease the sadness?
Thats really rough my friend. I am sure there must be other folks that you can befriend! Theres plenty of nice and kind people in the world.
Oh no I am so sorry to hear that! 
I cant imagine how much that much hurt. I hope you can at least cherish the memories you had together.
Nice! What so happens to be on the Master Chefs menu?
Thats sounds delicious. I am sure itll be much better than whatever Pizza Hut can make!
I would have been running away. What did you do?
LOL....that trash would have been on the ground.
Oh nice. What type of stuff does the store sell?
Thats cool. I like when stores are organized and not a chaotic mess!
Did this happen recently?  Did you take it back and admit the error?
Well you may want to think about admitting it to the store manager and paying for it.  Especially if its bothering you this much its the ony way to resolve it.
That really sucks. Is it because your mom was in the hospital? I am a psychic so I tend to know these things.
I am so sorry for your loss. It seems that I have to recalibrate my psychic abilities.
Are you nervous about it? Hope it goes well.
Well maybe you should start with a small slope and work your way up. Dont terrify yourself.
Oh man.  Now I am having images of the movie It in my head.  What did you do?
That is unusual behavior for a clown.  I would say you might want to call the authorities.  There has to be a law against a creepy clown stalker
Yeah ice cream really hits the spot when youre tired.  Especially when its hot in the summer time like this.
When the sun is burning like this Id like nothing more than to just lay under a soft serve machine and pull the handle.  Good times!
Nice! I bet your are excited about this
Nice. Its nice to know he is content with this decision. 
Oh no! How boring. Could you call up a few buddies to hang out?
I can agree. Dont be too down. Im sure you can find someting to keep you busy. 
Thats horrible. Were you able to get it up before it stained?
Yeah one look at a cute face like that and its hard to be mad.
That sucks. Did you tell him to go back and get the other one?
I wouldve taken that pizza out of the box and smack him upside the head with it. What a lousy guy!
Oh no! Did your dog have to go really bad or what happened?
Hopefully with enough training your puppy will let you know when she has to go. It takes time.
I feel ya! Do you have any big plans?
Nice! Ive been in San Diego for the past two weeks hitting up the beach. I wish I could go with ya since my vacation is coming to an end!
Are you ready for it?
Yeah I have faith in ya!!  Tear it up!
That is amazing. What a lovely and caring partner you have. You must be a happy person. Was it for any special occasion or just a surprise gift?
That is cute. You should also surprise your partner then with some adorable gift in return of this favor
Thats good to hear friend! Ive been trying to work off my debt as well. Once its done Im going to chop those things up.
I hear you. That really helped me out a bunch too. Itll be so nice when were both debt free!
You must be so proud but what was it for?
He must have worked really hard and it paid off. Good for him.
That would have been a pleasant surprise!!
you got a special niece. So talented and Kind.
Oh wow! I bet she and you are so excited about it!
What a nice surprise that is! I bet you anticipate her to love it!
Thats awful. I hope you can find a new job.
That a fart can hospitalize anyone is pretty impressive.  Did your story make the local news?
Oh no do you think your teacher will find out?
At least you have learned your lesson I hope? 
Did you have fun? Its always great to face your fears!
Yay! I always find myself really nervous before the ride but once Im off of it I want to go again! 
That sounds so embarrassing! Are you okay?
I am glad youre okay and you laughed it off. Just be careful the next time!
How exciting. What was it and did you cry?
Now that is a very interesting first word.
Holy cow!  Why didnt he say Bernie Sanders match me!?
What really grinds your gears friend? Rotten potatoes? Beverly hillbillies?
I hate mine too! I want to smash that thing with a sledgehammer!
Oh no! Was your neighbor upset about it.I bet your embarrassed.
I agree. You must find a way to preventthis so you dont get embarrassed again. 
I am sure they were happy tears.  How long had it been?
That is a long time.  I am sure you have a lot of catching up to do
omg. Driving skills are going down nowadays. You must very angry about it
You should have chased him and must give your piece of mind
Oh me TOO!!!!  That and Hee Haw both!  How did you cope?
Oh man.  So the cancellation of Beverly Hillbillies took a toll on your health?
Oh wow! Sounds like a wonderful time. Which one you taking them to?
Whatever they preach on Beverly Hillbillies is the law of nature. If they were afraid of coasters I would be too. Tread lightly friend.
Nice! Where are you going to do it?
I am sure you will too. When I did I thought I was on top of a mountain! but I really wasnt because I was plummeting towards the earth
Wow you must be so happy about it. 
Anyway you got it now. I so happy for it. Next you need take a precaution
Oh no! I bet your disappointed in his actions!
Im sorry about that. Im sure hes embarrassed about. I would be furious!
Good Job to her! I bet you were so proud of her!
Thats so good.I bet your overjoyed about it
That is never good.  Did you go out and check on it?
At least you will have a fun story to tell at parties.
Oh nice!  Did you have fun?  Did you finally jump?
haha.  I wouldve passed out and never woke up!  Silly me!
Do you like toads?
That was nice of your girlfriend do you love her?
Thats nice. What color did you paint it?
Those are swell colors! I am sure they will bring any guests much joy and merriment.
Thats disappointing. Im glad that you didnt let that stop you and that you still went out and had a good time!
Why werent your friends able to come?
Wow thats kinda mean
You think he will be there next time so you can help him?
haha was that intentional to get revenge on himher. or just that you were hungry?
haha. Did you tell him about it?
Very nice. I bet you were full of joy to see them.
I bet they are very sentimental to you. Being able to remember those days must feel good
Very sweet of him. Did he surprise you?
Nice! Hes a sweet kid. I bet that brought you joy as well.
That is good maybe you can get a raise.
Will you work there forever?
Ah that sucks you were going for any business meeting?
i hope you didnt lose that client
Oh wow thats not good at all
Yeah that sounds no good what will you do now?
wow you must have been out of this world
Only woman knows the hardship and endurance of pregnancy. I am happy for you
How nostalgic! Was there anything in there that surprised you?
Thats so cute. How old were you?
What is going on this weekend?
Are you driving with anyone?
Uh oh.  Better go back and get it!
Oh dang.  Thats awful.  Maybe someone will let you borrow some?
Thats awful. Did you confront him?
Is it your first date with her?
Where are you taking her?
Thats exciting! What do you plan to do with it?
Wonderful! Where are you going to go?
Are you looking forward to an event happening then?
Awesome! That should be a lot of fun!
That is great how long have you been married?
Third is very good! What kind of race?
Oh wow! Do you do a lot of marathons?
Hey you should give that back
Hey you should give the money back
Did you take a photo of them?
Keep trying never give up.
Maybe you should go to a temp agency.
I am so sorry to hear that. How long have you had him?
You must have developed strong attachments to him over all these years. To be honest I am not an animal lover individual
I know exactly what you mean. Its really tough but when I make decisions I try to stand on them and be willing to pivot if necessary.
That sounds right to me. I actually have a few people around me that give me straight forward advice like that.
Sometimes it can be true. Dont be taken for a run 
I hope that everything turns out the best for you too! 
Congratulations that sounds like things are moving along at a nice pace.
Thats understandable Im sure it will be exciting to customize and furnish your space.
How long has it been since you had your old dog?
It might take a bit of time to get back into the swing of owning a dog. Im sure youll be ready soon if you still think it over.
I lost my job so I know how you feel. It is tough not have a source of income. 
Sometimes you got to just do it and hope and pray all comes out like it should and it usually does. 
Its never to late to continue on that path or find a new one. Same happened here.
I always try to remind myself. Tomorrow is a new day. What do you want to do with yours?
Thats terrible. I dont know whats up with this world anymore it seems like things are always getting worse.
Well if they were family heirloom or photographs I dont really think the money would have been important. The family passes down antiques and precious items for keeping.
Have you tried talking to them about this? 
Thats really frustrating theyll realize only when you start distancing yourself from them
Did you hear anything about what happened at that camp in your absence? I hope there were no hard feelings!
Sorry for the delay. I had a technical difficulty. Either way Im sure there were no hard feelings. A lot of people sign up to work those camps every year.
Thats completely understandable. Have you tried distracting yourself with hobbies or productive chores?
Thats the best thing you can do really. I hope she comes back soon for your sake!
Any ice cream on sale sounds like a good time to me. Ive never heard of Blue Bell though is it any good?
Ill need to find some and give it a taste myself! That sounds awesome.
Oh no thats such an awful thing for them to do. Do your cats often ruin things in the household?
Oh odd. Thats a good way to look at it though too many people get too angry with their pets over these type of things.
And is he okay with that?
I suppose that makes sense. As long as both of you are happy with your relationship dynamic thats all that counts!
What happened to yours?
That is a real shame at least you can hold on to your memories.
Dang thats a definite mood killer. At least youve got a fix on the way.
One can only hope!
Well from what i have read we will all be drowning which isnt good.
Yeah forest fires are getting really bad.
Odd! Any idea where you went wrong?
Practice definitely makes perfect!
Soon they will be leaving the nest hey?
Im sorry to hear that.  Are you better now?
I hope it is nor Samonella just a temporarily bug.
You guys sound like great grand kids I bet she wholeheartedly appreciated it.
I bet you guys were close and this certainly brought you all closer together. Im so happy that you had these connections with your family.
Sounds like fun!  Did you enjoyed it? How far did you go?
Great! love road trips!  I hope to take one soon.
Why has your week been so busy?
Do you know what movie you plan on watching?
yikes! That must have caught you off guard.
Murphys law i suppose. Im sure it wasnt so bad though in the end.
Oh no! Did he take it okay?
Thats sweet that you guys are able to let the small things go. It sounds like you have a great relationship.
Im in the same boat. Im so happy to hear that and I hope you get the job!
Companies that pay their workers well equals happy workers!
Are you excited for the new group?
Well I hope it goes well!
Must be hard when you cant physically see what you are doing.
Yeah YouTube is a good source of information.
Oh no that sucks! What book?
Ah Ive never read it before I was hoping it would have been one Im familiar with.
Oh the nostalgia of watching old movies. What movie?
Unfortunately Ive never heard of it!
I used to want to do that so bad when I was younger. Was it amazing?
Thats so awesome. I dont think I would have the courage now. Will you do it again?
Thats a great goal to set for yourself. Where do you work if I may ask?
Sounds important. I hope youre able to meet your goal!
It must be nice to have that kind of trust for someone and motorcycles can be fun!
Awesome. Ive only rode dirt bikes personally but i definitely see the appeal. 
Aw Ive been there I bet you like it!  Especially after you get used to it.
That is such a great attitude!
Thats terrifying! I bet you didnt sleep that night!
HA! Are you a fan of horror movies now or do you still find them scary?
Yeah me either although there have been some good ones lately. Better stories more plot. 
I am sorry to hear that  I hope it is only a temporarily situation and you will be on your feet in no time.
Yes I know.  It hasnt been easy for me either but I believe think will go our way pretty soon.
Wow thats so exciting! I bet hes a nice guy in real life. 
Cool! Thats so neat. 
Oh no. Maybe you can find one that is used or even rebuilt. I got my car for 75 less than what I wouldve paid from a car dealer!
Well stick through it! I wish you luck  
Oh I could do that if I didnt have bad teeth and cant handle the cold. I would regret it if I did though because I really need to lose some weight.
Lol burn those calories. Hope you have a high metabolism.
Well you gave him the benefit of the doubt. It was his decision to cheat. 
Now you have more information to base your next decision on. You live you learn.
Thats kind of him! Is he good at that sort of thing?
Yes youd have more warranty kind of things with work from a dealership
Thats awesome! I wish someone in my family was so handy!
Wow! Maybe you should take uncle out for dinner! LOL
Me too. Old photos bring about such nostalgia.
I can only imagine! When my parents open old photo albums of my siblings and I they get tearyeyed.
Wow thats such an honor.  How do you feel about it?
Id be very nervous too.  I get stage fright.
I bet that whipped up a lot of feelings inside of you. Im sorry for your loss.
Thats great. Its just as good to remember the great times you spent together as it is to grieve.
Get away with what?
Did you get caught using them?!
Wow! Thats terrible! Maybe next time just get a tutor instead of cheating!
Sorry this happened!
Oh dear! What happened!?
Oh my goodness! Good for you for getting away from that trouble!
Next day guilt when the fun is done. How awful. I wonder if theyll fess up.
Yikes. Im glad youre not mixed up in that!
How did that go? Do you like that? 
Oh no! Really? Were they upset?
Who was it with?
Were you more mad at them or your spouse?
What was it?  Did everything turn out alright?
Phew! Im glad thats all it was.
Thats terrible when friends fight. What was it over?
Thats got to be a tough phone call to make. Did you two make amends or is she very upset?
Uh oh dont want to be that kid thats for sure!
How interesting.  How does that make you feel?
Yes I think that would be a little surreal and I might feel ambivalent about it.
I felt the same way as you but whats the point of keeping things you dont use and having it take up space? Do you use everything in your closet? 
So the items are sentimental to you? I know how hard it is to part with items that have memories behind them but at the end of the day they are just items! 
Oh how sweet! What did it say?
I love finding treasures like that! 
I hope that I am able to share such nice things with my own kids one day.
I really enjoy that too!
That is a lot of work! But I bet the reunion will be fun. 
Yum I love making and also eating desserts! Do you have a specialty?
Oh thats one of my faves. My go to is cheesecake. 
Its a crowd pleaser. I love the dips and apps at get togethers like that. 
Is that like hospice care? How do you deal with seeing loss so frequently?
Im sure you do a great job of making these people feel cared for and loved in their final times.
I bet it is. Thank you for giving your time to this type of work.
You deserve them! Thats excellent to hear.
Oh no! I hate when Im hungry for something and it goes wrong like that!
The worst! Did you find something else to eat?
Better than nothing but still no patty melt!
Thats exciting. Is that something you want to do?
That could definitely be tough. Especially with a baby.
Really did you get to pick the movie?
Oh wow thats always nice when everyone can agree on the same movie.
Thats always nice how did you respond?
Thats cool nothing wrong with being faithful. 
Nice jobs are ok but a new ride is really fun. What did you get
Toyotas usually last a long time so it might be a good decision.
Wow was it embarrassing?
Dang! Well at least you got a good story to tell now!
oh really hopefully its a pretty nice job cause moving is not fun.
Well at least you get to be with the man you love...hopefully
As long as youre safe about it. You can meet up at police stations too! 
More people are open and into it so yo ucan always talk to your police about it
Wow. Thats a long time. Longer than Ive been alive! Congrats on your successful marriage. Got any tips?
Thanks for the advice. I have trouble letting the petty things go but I think Ill learn to be better as time goes by. I wish you a happy marriage! 
Ohhhh thats so sad. I remember long ago when that happened to me. Did heshe live a good long life?
Yeah that is a shame. Im so sorry to hear about your loss. I know how important a great teacher can be your life.
Are you nervous? Or do you have amazing confidence in your ability?
Do make sure to get a good nights sleep before hand. That is just as important.
How old is your son?
I can understand why you felt so nervous. A mothers attachment is rather strong to a newborn. You should get him a gaurd dog when hes a bit older if you still feel that way.
Wow! I enjoy watching Overwatch on Twitch occasionally. Would you say thats your favorite game?
I never got into COD and I tried Overwatch when it first came out but I wasnt very good. Fortnite on the other hand Im alright at. 
Thats awesome! What did you have done?
I can imagine. Things like are always so stressful but so nice once they are completed.
Make sure to bring smores and bug spray. I hate bug bites. and love chocolate 
Make sure you bring something to drink as well. can get quite thirsty ya know.
Oh I feel you! Every time I go back to stay with my family it feels... claustrophobic almost.
Im sure they are! Itll feel more normal soon I am sure
Whats wrong with your tooth? I hope its not too painful of an experience.
Yikes! Ive had that before. My thoughts are with you. Im sure the dentist will take care of it though.
Thats awful.  What are you going to do?
Interest are you going to try and get him to sell it?
That will be fun maybe he will even let you play his xbox on it.
Same. When you had one phone in the middle of the house with the SUPER long phone cord so you could at least get around the corner to talk.
I agree. The convenience is nice now but the quality is much lower.
Were you close to your wifes grandmother?
That is very heartbreaking. Im sure she had a very positive opinion of you as well.
Im sure your wife also appreciates you getting along with her family.
Those times seemed much simpler didnt they? Do you ever break out of the routine?
I see. How do you like playing the piano?
Thats the spirit. I bet youre a wonderful pianist.
Awesome! Anything exciting on the horizon to treat yourself?
Whats the one you are most excited about?
Well that stinks.  What are they drilling for?
Are they almost done with it?
That is sad.  I am sure you can come up with a good career.  What do you like to do?
Thats exciting and nerve wracking at the same time I bet. How do you feel about it?
For sure. Well good luck! Nurses are very underappreciated. I hope you get.
that can be tough but it also can be great to have time for yourself
i can see where isolation can be overwhelming and the need for social contact is desirable and needed
Oh thats exciting. Are you nervous to have them over?
I bet its all in your head. I am sure it will all good smooth.
Aww thats so cute! Was it tough trying to get it to swim?
Proud of the little pup!
Thats so creepy and scary. What happened next?
Why are there so many weirdos in this world? Im glad you made it out safe.
What for? I hope it wasnt for anything dangerous.
Thats a little dangerous. Id definitely talk to her about why you didnt allow her to go to that party and maybe shell realize that what youre doing is for her own good.
Yes I understand!  It is so hard to lose weight!
Yes.  Chocolate is my nemesis.  I think it is more addicting than cocaine
Ouch thats unfortunate. Hopefully it turned out okay though?
I can imagine talk about bad timing injuring your toes!
Oh no! Did you get in trouble?
Good for you for standing up for your little brother. hope the kid is ok though.
Sometimes when you are looking back at a situation you get a whole new perspective now that youre away from it. Im happy that you have that realization.
Are they gone now or is a reunion possible?
Gods Plan! Do you know why he did it?
Dang I wish I could have it happen to me someday!
Thats great!  Such a satisfying feeling!  Did you get a good grade?
I hope you were really proud of yourself 
Thats really good news. It must be frustrating to move from place to place constantly. Is your family happy with the place?
I hope you and your family enjoy the new home.
Amen. What kind of dogs do yo have?
Aw little guys. Do they walk well on the leash?
Thats about how mine is. He is a bit bigger so he pulls a little harder. I found using a harness has helped.
He is a mix breed. We dont really know.
That sounds great! Are you excited?
I hope you accomplish everything!
Oh my goodness. That must have been traumatic to see. Do you know what happened to the dog?
Well Im sorry you had to see that!
I agree with that. I always try to give the benefit of the doubt at first.
Oh man. Bless your soul! I bet that can test your patience.
Im sure it can be highly rewarding too.
Im glad its over and nothing happened. do you have an underground shelter?
Oh I would be scared too. apartments seem safe unless the roof gets ripped of of coarse.
I hope you do it!
congratulations! that is exciting. How long have you been waiting for this.
Very cool. I wish you all the best.
Im a freelancer
started out slow but now it is!
Oh no! Not the old pop on the rug trick. Did you yell?
What kind of dog? I have a boston terrier. Shes the cutest. 
Oh cute! What a devil. 
Mine too. Cant help it those eyes!
Oh no! Did you have to go home and change?
What a bummer! Sorry to hear that. 
That is so cool! Im not married yet
Maybe im not sure yet
Aw thats tough!  Have you talked to him about it?
It might have upset him but Im sure hell understand!  Everyone loses their temper sometimes and its not like you didnt have a legit reason
I hope its a lot more than just a gift card but at least Starbucks should be a lot of money because its so expensive there!
oh yes then you need much more than a starbucks gift card!  good luck!!
I am sorry that must have been tough.  She probably felt bad for you.
That is great because friendships are very important
Its shows a lot of care
A point of what? Like of land?
Oh boy. Im not sure where youd find one. Thats pretty old fashioned. Did you find one?
Oh no! That must have put you in a bad position. How did you handle it?
Sounds like a great way of handling a potentially sticky situation  good job!
hi friend who is too good to you?
thats good though! I bet youre grateful.
Thats so cool of you
Yeathats the right thing to do
I know! That must be frustrating. Do you have enough money to cover it?
Oh wow... it seems like bad things always hit at once like that. Hang in there  I hope it will get better for you!
Im sure it was scary to leave your kids for the time but at least it was their aunt and not a stranger! 
Oh thats so great  and now you can feel comfortable leaving them with her more often!
It does sound like fun though. Did you have a good time?
Are you ever going to do it again or are you done? I went when I was a child. 
True. Easier said than done though. How can we be?
Definetly! it starts with a single person right
Did  you layer had the surgery?
Oh Im sorry to hear that! That must have been upsetting.
Then you must have felt relief.
oh I am so sorry I am assuming the injury was serious?
oh man I hope you got a second opinion? I would be so worried about your injury. I am so sorry.
Hasnt everyone done so at some point?
Atleast it wasnt in class at a college or something right?
I wouldnt sweat it chances are you wont see any of those people again right? Even if you do its unlikely theyll remember you let alone your smelly fart.
oh my gosh thats so cute! I bet they were the cutest.
Im sure it does I dont have any of my own but I would be really sentimental.
Yes but think of all the opportunities it can open up. Dont let fear stop you!
I know but Im sure youll do great! I went to school for many years through a Masters degree and although it was hard it was worth it. 
Did she forget it at home or did she just not bother turning it in?
Be happy that you were able to spend some time with her and sharing personal time with her by helping her with her homework. Not many parents do that for their children
oh no! I bet you were so mad! were you able to find something else to snack on?
That is heartbreaking. That sounds really good. Never purchased one of those.
I am completely agree.  How long have you been married?
Constant work and attention is key to a great relationship!
That sucks.  I hate having scratched glasses
Yes and it always bothers me looking through scatches.
Im so sorry to hear that. I was together with my wife for 7 years when she left me so I know your pain.
It takes awhile for it to be over. Find a hobby to take your mind off of it. It helps to ease the pain.
yes that is always a hard situation.  
oh man that is horrible!  I am so sorry
Thats the best decision. I know mine wouldnt either. If he is a good guy he will understand.
Thats good. No sense in rocking the boat.
It is definitely good to get that looked at right away. Then they can take care of it!
Oh I know its hard. Just try to relax and it will go quick. 
Nice! Did it help you become less stressed?
Dang well I hope you can continue your goal of meditating every day!
Scared of what
Ohdont mind mejust been curious
I feel that plus its nice not to have to worry about returning it.
Oh thats not good..sometimes teenagers can be alittle messy
Well I am sure he will get better with age
I think theme park rides are scary! Was it scary when you were stuck?
They are really good about that. They have a lot of safety features you dont even realize. We were stuck on Space Mountain once. 
Awww youre speaking fondly on when he was young. Is he not as nice anymore?
Thats depressing to here. I have family members who are still cool now as well but I just think so fondly on when they were younger. They grow up too fast and it really is amazing when theyre young and innocent and havent been exposed to the real world yet.
I suppose but research and concrete knowledge is more beneficial as it is a very hands on and physical occupation especially when the health of others are in their hands.
That is true. There are many situations where experience can strengthen your skills compared to just learning it from a book.
Dogs are wonderful pets. They are so loving and devoted. What kind of dog do you have?
Thats an awesome name. I have two feists. If youre not familiar with the breed they resemble Jack Russell terriers but they are bred for squirrel hunting. Their names are Whiskey and Ruby.
all the time I am not sure I believe in God
thats pretty crazy you could of had your money and the care package too
yeah I understand what you mean definitely
Oh I am so sorry! I am an animal lover too. We have two dogs now but used to have cats too. We did have to say goodbyes to some of our pets over years. Its heart breaking...
How long did you have your cat?
Was it a holiday?
It sounds like a fun event.
Oh no! That is so frustrating.
That is good that you are a nice friend to her. 
I am sure you were.  Was boot camp really hard
I could never do something like that.  Thank you for your service
Oh wow. I would hate that. What ended up being the issue?
Maybe he has forgotten how it feels to randomly be called into your bosses office. Hes moved on up.
Oh no  how is she feeling now?
Yeah that had to be tough. Im glad shes doing better now though. 
What a bummer! What place did you end up getting?
I know the feeling. You work so hard just to feel crushed.
Did you get hurt or drown a bit?
Nice well hopefully nothing like that ever happens again!
I sure hope the hot dog was fit to eat 
Oh you shouldnt feel bad about it im sure it was fine to eat!
Thats really good you guys can trust eachother like that. That helps make you both grow in the relationship.
Wow! You dont see much of that anymore. So true.
Yes I am a product of a broken marriage. My children are too. Keep up the good work you guys!
Where were you not invited to?
You were not invited?! Thats awful. How close are you to your friend?
Heywere you injured?
Hope they took it easy with you?
Aww that is so sweet.  I completely understand why!  Oh and thank you for your apology but I am truly content and have accepted it.
Men are crazy sometimes!  LOL!
Sounds like a fun one to me. Are you happy there?
I agree. Im sure you get bored or lonely while traveling too. 
who is that?
sometimes we have to learn how to not be jealous of things
Thats always a good feeling. I bet you are excited to come home everyday.
What a good dog and full of joy!
I bet she loves you just at much as you love her.
I hope you have a good time and you enjoy it.
I bet everyone should take time out yo enjoy life every once in awhile.
Did you do it? How far does he live from you?
Oh no! Was he mad?
What is a hot slap? Sounds painful!
They havent called you back yet? I hate when that happens they make you wait by the phone on pins and needles!
Dont let it break your confidence though it just wasnt meant to be. I think youll land your next application though.
Uncertainty can be so agonizing. Just keep your head up though!
Oh my gosh! Have they broken it? That would drive me nuts.
Have you spoken to them personally? Maybe they should pay for you to move it!
Wow. Im so sorry. Maybe you could put concrete around it so it damages their car? lol
Wow that sounds intriguing what new things did you try?
Thats awesome cows are amazing
Yeah its crazy how each year seems to go by faster than the last too having kids must be surreal
Me too its like you realize more and more that all you have is the present moment.
Wow congrats what did you end up naming him?
You are lucky and I am sure he will be tons of work but it will be worth it.
sounds exciting. I always wanted to leave my were I was originally from so I could experience and see new things
No but i hope things work out for you in this new part of your life.
Oh definitely. Why did you?
I can. Im so sorry. Was it something really bad? Or were you able to move on from it?
Its always fun to get new clothes! Is the wedding soon?
Im not very fashionable but I do have some tshirts that I love to wear because they fit me really well.
Sounds like a real hard decision. I would be very apprehensive as well.
You sound so excited about it and your future there. I would be full of joy as well.
That sounds like some good work experience. How long is he in.
Well hopefully he is as good as Sherlock Holmes and saves some lives.
Thats the worst. I wonder if he was trying to prove something.
Good! I dont know why people think they can get away with things like that.
congrats how did you handle the pressure?
It can be pretty nerve racking but it is always great practice. You will only get better.
OMG! especially recently. a week seems like one day.
Thats so true. My daughter moved out this year and Im wondering where the heck the time went!
Oh really? Are you a massage therapist?
Wow congratulations! You must be so excited!
Im good whats up?
Yeah that must be difficult
Way to go! If it makes you feel better I would be your friend if I was there
I used to but yeah especially if youre not in school
Hope you didnt take a bath after that
Minus one for cats
Wow Brazil? Isnt there a lot of crime there?
What is she going to do there sounds kind of dangerous.
Thats good how does that make you feel
Nice I like your attitude
Nice too bad I wasnt invited!
Sounds fun! Keep fighting the good fight lol
No! I think that should be on my bucket list though.
I bet that would be cool. Ive watched on Tv. They know what their doing.
What are you waiting for?
Oh I totally know how that goes. I moved to small town and didnt have many friends at first. Once I had my son and made more friends it got way better lol!
Thanks you as well. I know how that is. give it time and things will get better.
Yeah I think it gets more difficult as you get older anyway.
Aw I know how that goes. Do they visit often?
Wow thats sad. Im sorry.
That does sound exciting! Why are you scared?
Oh that is definitely a change! But at least you can still keep in touch nowadays.
Yeah I have one but theyre all over the place it seems like
Thats funny just dont let it in your room while your sleeping!
Babies are pretty small and delicate they look like they might break at the slightest bump.
Its a pretty small percentage but it would definitely be something to worry about.
Wow that would be terrible news. I cant imaged shit is taking it well.
Hopefully she has a supportive partner to help her as well. Glad you are there to help her.
That is horrible I am so sorry It is hard losing a baby animal you are not expecting them to pass like when you have an older sickly one
That is crazy I wonder what was wrong with it
Wow I never knew cats could even get an aneurysm but I guess like humans why wouldnt they be able to?
Ahhhh thats amazing! I stay home with my kids too! How many kids do you have?
It definitely can be a challenge. I have a 10 year old boy an 8 year old girl and a 2 year old girl. I love being home with them.
Oh no what happened? Did they do or say something?
Oh girl that happens to me all the time too. So frustrating just leave us alone.
Im sorry is it difficult to take care of her?
Dang I hope everything turns out okay for you guys
Hmm how did that make you feel
Yeah at least now youre more aware it can be pretty tough when youre trying to break the habit though
Good to hear that you keep your word
Keep it up brochacho
At least that shows that you have a conscience. I hope that you made it up to them.
Confess to them what happened. Let them know how you have changed.
Wow I am sure the Veterans loved it! What kind of treats did you and the kids bring to them?
So thoughtful of you! What did the kids think of visiting the veterans?
Wow that is some really early christmas shopping. you must like to plan ahead.
Yeah spending money on things is always a temporary high.
I love vegetable soup. So were you able to enjoy your nap ?
Well Im happy for you. Its hard to catch a nap around here sometimes.
Sounds like she has some underlying issues with trust. You may want to sort it all out before you get too involved.
Maybe you couldnt but it sounds like something is going on with her. 
That was nice of them. Did you have any problems with their car?
THat is good to hear. What happened to your own car?
Well at least you can trust him to be careful.  I dont think I would be able to trust my nephew as he is only 18 and not very responsible yet.
Yes its amazing how much of  a difference a few years can make in age.  It seems that males take quite awile long to mature than females.   
Thats so nice of you I would have chased down the car but you did the right thing
Feels bad hope you have someone to talk about it with!
What kind of job is it?   I will keep my fingers crossed he gets it!
THats awesome does it pay better than the one he has?  A pay increase is certainly helpful.
oh wow i am glad she was happy why were you nervous?
oh dont be you should be happy for her there will come a time where you will get something back in return 
Boy oboy bet she is having the time of her life. How many vacations have you taken this year?
Me too maybe our wish will come true only time will tell.
Oh wow! Thats like the worst nightmare! Im so sorry that happened to you!!
Were you able to get out of there without anybody noticing or did you die from embarssment?
Im sure that was not a fun ride home. 
where you disappointed? 
I remember the same thing. And the joy that followed for the next moth was pure bliss
Alright so do you ever have to evacuate?
maybe go earlier later?
oh thats kind of weird
... im sorry how did it happen
that sucks but hey man its okay one day youll find right person 
Nice! The married life is expensive
I hope you two have a nice future. At least you know the family will support you!
Oh! What happened?
Wow! You lazy bum. You disappointed me too!
That sounds awful. Who was it you wronged?
Was she understanding and forgiving?
Im sure you will be able to get another one fairly quickly!
I hope that you see amazing results and you continue to enjoy yourself!
Do you think its possible that he does still love you and also made a horrible mistake?
I think that when people cheat and lie its because something is wrong with them and not their partner.  If he doesnt realize his mistake then he doesnt deserve your love.  I wish you all the best!
I hope you realize your worth too. I do this thing where I think about another woman in my life who I really care about mom daughter etc. and I think if this was happening to them what kind of advice would I give them?  Sometimes we think we deserve less.
what do you mean?
oh what happend
yes i do thats why i only trust one person my wife
im sorry what did happend next? how does that make you feel?
Thats horrible! Did you have any sort of tracker on it?
Awwe that is so sweet how did you two meet? 
Wow that sounds like a really big journey. It must have been really hard to connect with one another only through online chats.
Mmm that sounds delicious. There is always time to make pancake Tuesdays at home!
I see memories will always stay sometimes good old days just cant come back.
I havent but its definitely on my bucket list!
I bet it helped having someone there who knew what they were doing. 
I have a friend who recently became certified as an instructor. He jumps almost every weekend. He will be taking me when I go!
I believe I was fifteen. I drove a soccer mom van!
Did you ever get caught?!
Oh no! I would have been furious! Were you able to catch him?
Oh im so sorry! I bet your are devestated! I would be tool.
Oh okay.... was that even a temptation to begin with?
Alrighty then just seemed like a really weird thing to say. 
Oh no that is awful! It is against the law where I live to ban animals from the house. So legally I am allowed to have a pet even if the contract says no pets allowed. 
Canada! You should check the laws in your area to see whether or not you are legally allowed to have a pet even if the land lords do not approve.
Im so sorry to hear that. I hope shell be doing good she is very lucky to have someone taking care of her.
You must have a very good connection thats beautiful.
Oh no! Hopefully you didnt get too many nasty stares!
Oh well accidents happen!
Ive had a similar experience with a gossiping coworker. It made the workplace such an uncomfortable environment!
Its a good lesson to learn! Dont worry about it too much. I am sure that the truth will surface eventually.
wow that sure is a lot of stuffed animals did you play with toys alot at a kid?
what kind of interests?
Thats very exciting! Im sure he put a lot of work towards that.
All the work paid off!
did  you end up ending the friendship?
you didnt let anything affect the friendship! thats good i am proud of you
Oh that is definitely something to be excited about!
That is quite unique. Im happy to hear that!
that must have been so painful dont get embarrassed it happens to everyone people fart in public transports people fall and rip their jeans people cry over stupid things its a totally normal thing 
you sure will besides hot jocks doesnt sound too bad too me 3
Was that your idea? Why did you decide to do that?
You must really trust her to let her hold on to your lifes savings!
My condolences to you. Will you be able to visit his gravesite?
Yes it will be worth saving up for. I hope it works out for you.
I hope that nothing came of it though.
Im sure nothing happened! Gotta have some trust.
Great confidence! what do you anticipate your grade to be
You prepared well! You will do goo.
Thats great! good luck
I can agree with that
I a so sorry to hear that. How are you coping with your loss? 
Yes sometimes that is the only thing you can do. I hope you are also getting some support from family and other friends 
You sound prepared for it! Im sure you have practiced.
Very nice! Keep the confidence and dont doubt yourself tomorrow.
Hey what is up? 
Oh no want to talk about it?
Oh no thats terrible what are you going to do?
Well thats no good you could try taping it back together
Thats great I always love to hear about happy couples. Too much bad news in the world.
Oh eats lots of cake and make sure to have a nice dinner with candles. Maybe a bubble bath too.
Hi there howre you?
Im doing well. Its quite early in the morning though thats for sure.
I know the feeling When you finally have your own place to do what you want.  
Good or bad I have been in that situation many times.  More recently when I was separated from my current wife.  My own place.  Finally!
why? what did he do?
oh i know this feeling but dont worry its okay! these things happen soon feeling will disappear 
I hope you do too. Sounds like you did well preparing. 
Very good! I anticipate you will get in!
Is your dog ok?
Does your sister usually have problems?
That sounds like the worst feeling.
ah i know this feeling how did the conversation go?
its okay next just tell them that you didnt quiet understand what they meant and so they will explain it again
You shouldnt be so attached to your old stuff you might end up a hoarder!
Well that is a good reason to keep holding on to something!
Oh no. Did you study for it?
I hope it goes better than you expect! Cram all that information into your brain!
What makes you so afraid of them? They do eat all the other creepycrawlies after all. 
True they arent a very visually appealing species. But at least theyre more afraid of you thats some consolation. 
Oh no how did you feel?
I totally understand that feeling and know what you mean! But I wouldnt sweat over it it happens to the best of us and we learn fro our mistakes!
I usually stick with what I know also
Absolutely Especially when spending a lot of money
That sounds awful. I hope he is better now!
Its wonderful you had someone like your mother to help!
Oh no! Maybe you can get her a gift and some sweets to make up for it?
Hopefully she will understand!
Awesome I bet youre with your puppy all the time now 
Puppies are so wonderful Im happy for you!
I know what you mean maybe ask if the place is hiring? 
ohh okay I see yeah that is a difficult situation. I hope it works out for you and best of luck buddy! 
Oh no! Im sorry to hear that. I hope she gets better.
Im glad that she is getting better!
I cant imagine what that must have felt like. What helped you get through it?
At least you kept your sense of humor! 
Did you hear the Youll be a ditchdigger speech like my brother did?
Not everyone is cut out for sitting in a classroom listening to droning teachspeak.
That doesnt sound like such a pleasurable memory. Maybe you received a gift your brother always secretly wish he had!
You know what they say the grass is always greener on the other side. Did you ever manage to get him to let you borrow his snowboard?
Im not afraid of clown myself but I can absolutely see how they can be terrifying to some people!
I agree with you. Those painted smiles and big red noses can be so offputting!
That is awesome can you tell me more about what you will be doing? 
Wow that sounds really awesome I would love to listen to you songs. Can I also be the first to receive your autographs? 
Wow she must be a talented child! Im sure youre so proud of her.
Now thats an achievement you and her will remember till the rest of her life!
Congrats! That is always a great feeling.
It certainly has. You deserve it.
How did that turn out?
Congrats! Thats awesome to hear.
haha we all did crazy things when we were young! did you ever get caught?
good plan.  Wait until the shopkeeper was busy with someone else.
Congratluations! I bet your full of joy!
I bet you are! I think you will enjoy your new home and city!
I bet! Have you gotten any word back yet?
Congratulations! Youre going to do wonderful I just know it!
Oh no! How awkward! did anyone see it?
Probably but that is still the worst thing ever.  Are you finally able to laugh about it?
I am glad! You must have a very good veterinarian
Well Im glad that you found someone worthy!
Oh my goodness! Is she going to be alright?
The unknown is always so scary but especially in your case! Im so happy that shes going to be ok. Hopefully that puts you more at ease now.
That is wonderful.  What is your dogs name?
Thats a big dog.  Blu is a cool name!
Do you at least enjoy the new job?
Hopefully the more you warm up to the new job it will become easier.
That sounds awesome. A lot of people would kill to have a cooperative work environment. I bet it increases performance as well.
Wow that sounds like an interesting process! Ive never done it myself but it sounds like something I would love to learn.
I love the foo fighters too.  I would have be raging!  What happened?
Well thats not too bad then.  Good on you for putting your education and studies first.  Im sure it wasnt easy at the time.
I hope that business goes well!
Thats great. I am sure you will turn a profit in no time
Why 8 years? Thats a very specific time ago.
Thats ridiculous! They were clearly not your friends. There are much better people in the world.
It should be fun! Do you like baseball?
I think you will be fine. If you need some alcohol to take the edge off go for it.
Thats terrible you had no clue it was coming?
what did the note say?
How long did it take you? Thats amazing.
I consider you to be a lucky guy. I hope one day I can pay mine off completely. 
My husband owns a business and its also stressful. What kind of business did yall start?
Oh . What do you do for that?
At least you are comfortable and enjoying that! Some people would hate being alone.
That is great! Im sure everything will work out.
Hi! Tell me something about yourself!
Oh no? I hope youre okay. Why is it that you feel guilty?
oh wow! did she notice?
how did you feel when you eventually found out that she know?
You must have been really drunk!
Im sorry to hear that. I know that can be stressful.
Yeah I hope so too. That must be painful to bare. 
Im sorry. I can imagine how you felt! Hopefully you hit a home run!
Thats something I would never forget. Hopefully you get another shot at it. 
I totally understand what you mean. Peace and quiet is nice but I bet you miss your son when he is gone?
Thats not surprising! Are you thinking about going back to work soon?
Wow that is a lot of people! What were you doing on stage?
That would make me so nervous! I am horrible in front of people. How did it go?
So sorry to hear that Hard to be alone.
What did he train you in?
Wow  tell me about it
That is great  so happy for you 
Are you friends with your neighbor
You shouldnt be embarrased around your best friends. Im sure hes just picking in good fun
Oh no that doesnt sound good. What almost happened?
Well Im glad you sobered up and didnt do anything you would regret later!
Ohdont take it so hardits always like thatso sorry about that
It will work out if you believe
What were you trying to do?
Did they ever come?
Oh absolutely. Thats the worst feeling. Who hurt you and how are you doing now?
Dating is one of those things that everyone makes seem so easy but in reality its just so difficult to be able to open up to people sometimes. I hope things go well for you and you meet someone who makes you very happy!
Ah. I can imagine Ive been in a similar situation. But just remember he loves you and if hes never given you any doubt then trust him
Oh I completely agree with you. Some women just need a challanege you know. But its like HANDS OFF!
Wow  that must be do disgusting 
I know exactly how that feels.  
Did you fix it so that they wont lose their property in the future?
Im confused. What do you being his girlfriend have to do with you not taking his property?
I hope you are right.
Where do you live?  Cause it isnt in the US.
i guess we all learn from our mistakes never take her there again
Thats the thing with accusations anybody can say anything. But if they dont have any proof then its meaningless.
Its hard to be accused of something you didnt do. Im glad the truth prevailed.
OK  calm down  take a deep breath and relax 
OK  now I get it. But you need to rehearse in front of a mirror  that will help
That sounds pretty nervewracking. How did it go?
That is positive you must really love her!
That is true love I am so glad you met her! 
appearance is important whats more important is how you look on the inside!
be nice to people and youll see that thats the only thing people care about!
Dealing with kids can be like that. Is there something about doing his hair that he is scared of?
Sounds like a bribe is in order. Then its a win for everyone.
Yuck! I am so afraid of spiders. Were you able to squash it?
Haha! Thats amazing! What a great shot. I usually have to make my husband get rid of them for me.
that is so much trust! i hope she doesnt let you down!
that went really dark quickly. making a mistake is not the same thing as dying.
Why?  The sun is going to engulf the earth in a few billions years.  And even before that the Y chromosome in humans is going to die out and our civilization will end.
Now that is hopeful.
did it feel nostalgic? 
you sure had a fun childhood!
Thats very nice of you. I feel the same way about my husband. Isnt it nice to care about someone?
It is probably one of the best feelings!
how much you trust him?
do you believe he comes you with life long?
What was it that made you so proud of him?
being honest is always a good thing I am glad you are so proud of him!
i have. have you?
aw thats great. youre lucky to have a father who cared like that. mine never did
Oh no! How old was he? Im so sorry losing a pet is so hard.
What color was he and its not your fault you were just doing what you thought was best for him.
yep i have a cat. hes really sweet and totally worth it. but it all depends on what kind of animal you get
hmmm do you think hell like that after all this time?
Oh wow That is a huge step! Are you nervous?
Thats great! How old are you?
Oh no that must have been so embarrassing. Were you injured at all? 
Embarrassment is almost worse than an actual injury! I hope your knee feels better soon.
that mustve been very disapointing
maybe youll be luckier next time!
Thats fantastic! Have you been working extra hard to earn it all or did it come to you some other way?
Wow! Im really happy for you that must be such a great feeling of peace. 
Hahah! I bet your cat get spoiled plenty!
What color did it end up being?
Are you serious? Thats not even close to being the same color.
What is wrong?
Oh no! that must have been embarrasing
Why dont you think it will be a good fit? You might be underestimating yourself
You do have a good point. You really should do what will make you happy because life is just too short
Oh no! That must have been really embarrassing! How did you respond?
I dont blame you. That was so rude of her to make that comment in front of everyone.
Good for you! 
Does that at least inspire you to improve your abilities?
I feel that way sometimes too
Have you ever knew some that got to do everything you wanted to but couldnt? Well have and its not fun.
I think I will . Thank you for your advice.
how did that make you feel?
maybe in the future youll get to go there!
Oh thats not good. What did you do? 
Im sorry you are going through that. Sometimes telling the truth is the best even if other people might get in trouble.
Oh wow. I know being away from our loved ones can make it hard to sleep. Have you tried to listen to nature sounds? I have an app on my phone and I play rain sounds to help me sleep. 
I love listening to nature. I live in the country and could not imagine being in the city. I lived there for a few months but there was too much traffic and noises that kept me up. I moved back to the country. 
Thats a great career.  
did you have fun?
wow  that sounds so cool!
You sound very grateful. 
Well hopefully you will enjoy it while you are here! 
Thats a great positive attitude. 
thats nice. i wish i had people like that to work with
i wonder if he has a crush on you or wants something in return
did it boost your confidence and faith in mankind?
glad to hear it. i hope its only grown since then
Im sorry to hear that. Did they give you a severance package? Also Do you have prospects for a future position?
At least they did that much for you. Im sure youll land on your feet. You seem like an optimistic type
Thats wonderful! I hope you find fulfillment and a sense of purpose not to mention a chunky wallet haha
Personally I find that a job you enjoy that gets you by is superior to one that makes you a lot of money at the cost of your happiness
Did it make you nostalgic?
I know what you mean life gets more complicated as you get older 
Funny how some of those smells bring back the feelings of old times!
Oh I see  what happens then?
Thats ok  Its a gods grace
You sound confident. Did the interview go that well?
Congrats dearam so happy fpr you
Did he notice? That would have been embarrassing.
That is terrible family should never betray each othey
Hey family is still family. Unfortunately we dont get to pick and choose. I know it can be hard 
dont be sad itll be okay
thats great then  glad it didnt affect anything
well you should be happy for them!
no  but if you really liked her  you should be happy that she found someone she like.
hope they were bad ones
maybe you just dont realize they were bad because youre optimistic to a fault
Thats great you should always feel confident in yourself. What is your project?
Cool! Theres a lot of money to be made creating games! I bet you will do well.
Wow like seriously.  Why the show off? 
OK  maybe shes materialistic 
I hope she gets better. It must be very hard seeing loved ones in sickness.
Thats wonderful. I hope that her sickness hasnt been too taxing on you.
Thats annoying did you call him after he didnt turn up?
Thats understandable. What a frustrating experience for you.
Oh Im sorry. Everyone makes mistakes sometimes. 
Thats how it works with siblings! 
There are so many things that come out at night. What are you referring to?
They come out in the daytime too. Its just that they are scarier at night.
Oh man you must be really intelligent to test for Mensa! I bet it was difficult!
I hope you hear positive news from them soon!
WHY ? what did you lie about? 
if you truly regret it you will tell her now go and do that1
i can imagine it happend to me before and it was actually someone trying to break in i called hte police and they ran off
I hoe you made it there. Getting lost sucks!
I am glad you made it there with only a few hiccups along the way. You must have a good memory when it comes to directions. 
Wow. That is very interesting. These days many people get married later in life. Congratulations!
That is good to hear. Yeah my parents married young and it worked out for them too. I am happy to hear that it turned out good for you.
oh no  thats so sad i also have a cat but she is in her early days 
i know right? they make you happy and in the end thats all one needs
I know how you feel that would gross me out too.  Makes me feel like whoever prepared my food was not very clean.
I agree I wouldnt be in the mood to eat after that either its disgusting.
which way is that?
maybe it happend for a reason? maybe you will find a better apportunity to get there
Can you tell me the name of the book? I find myself being engaged by a lot of novels these days.
How many pages do you have to go? You should try to finish it today and power through it!
its insane how Youtube and the internet overall are so helpful!
thats so insane right? glad you did it yourself!
Im sorry to hear that. Tell me a fond memory you have of himher.
Yeah each cat has their own personality. Its good to reflect on little things like that. Maybe once the sting of all of it is over you can get another one and continue to create more sweet memories like the one you just shared with me.
Its terrible when people cant take no for an answer. Did you report her?
Wow she sounds like a real piece of work. Im glad you reported her. Maybe they should consider firing her.
I think you do not like cats very much ...
Well then you should think about God when you see them
Oh Im really sorry to hear that. Has he been looking for another job?
We went through the same thing with my husband. I know it is stressful but I am so glad you got through it and things are better now. 
That sounds exciting? Did you get in to the club? 
Wow its always nice when we get something we really want. Especially if we have to compete for it.
Thats good because you prepared for it
Wowyou made itcongrats
who does and that is mean of them.
Sure  your worth your time. do not be so down on yourself.
Wow  18 years. Accept my condolence please 
Just take heart OK  its one of those things
Maybe its time to clear your conscience so you wont have to feel so bad anymore.
You cant change the past. All you can do is learn from it. If you are sincere then your family will forgive you.
Same dont know what i would do without them.
Thats part of being a good parent it all goes hand in hand.
Im so sorry!  Thats awful!  Did you get his insurance information?
Thats a mercy at least. Are you hurt?
Is there anyone else you can talk to? Maybe even Human Resources?
I see where youre coming from. Sometimes though you got to make a stand and show youre serious about the position.
What a lovely gift. Im sure that you will always treasure it because it came from him.
Makes it even better that you didnt know you were getting it.
Did it take a long time to complete?
Thats awesome! I am glad it didnt take long because those have been a pain in the past for me.
I can certainly relate to you it could be a safety hazard.
Thats a smart move that would reduce the risk of injury.
I agree. Do you find yourself in that situation right now? 
Thats very kind of you to be so considerate. Hopefully the right choice will make itself obvious to you in the near future. 
Well good luck to you! 
Great I hope you get it.
What type of job is it?
Oh no do what?
Thats terrible hope you werent counting on it for fincancial reasons
That is great! Are you doing it yourself or are you hiring someone to help you out? 
That sounds exciting it is always nice to have new kitchen appliances! I hope all goes well
Im sorry to hear that! Maybe you can find a local club so you can meet people with similar interests!
That sounds like fun! And a great cure for loneliness! 
Oh no what was wrong?
Aw did it turn out okay?
Oh no!  That had to be frustrating. I hope it wasnt too close to closing.
I hope you still found a great home! The home buying process is certainly frustrating.
Oh no. Im so sorry. I totally understand how you feel. Mine passed away a few years ago Its very difficult
It definitely helps to have a lot of support around you. Take care of yourself through this very difficult time.
Oh my goodness! I did that after swimming one day. I was so busy getting the kids dressed that I forgot to clean my face. Black mascara all down my cheeks.
No and I went to the grocery store and the library like that! No one said a word. It was so embarrassing.
Were there other parents there? I think that anyone who has kids would understand.
I can understand being humiliated in the moment. Thankfully most kids grow out of that phase!
2 year olds dont know any better. And when everyone laughs it can make them want to do it again.
Oh Im sorry to hear that! It can be tough when we feel that we have lost face in front of others.
Well lets pretend that no one noticed! Either that if someone noticed perhaps they smiled when they thought Wow Ive had that happen before too 
I am sorry to hear that. I hope your financial situation improves in the future.
I believe that you will be in a better situation soon.
Oh wow! How did it go?
Im sure you did great! Id be a ball of nerves too though.
Haha but you survied Go you!
Were they from when you were a kid?
I know what you mean. I sure miss my departed loved ones.
Oh no! Does he do that a lot?
I would be also. You should try to get him to fix your tire. 
Oh Im sorry to hear that. Losing a family member is so hard.
I miss my grandmother every day. I hope things get easier for you over time.
What was a good move?
Oh wow that is a long time. Why did you change your job?
Hey a similar thing happened to me! I hope no one saw!
Ooops! Im sorry to hear that. Ill tell you what though it happens to the best of us! Its just a drink.
That must have been messy.  Were you able to get it all cleaned up?
Im sure shes done something like that in the past herself though.
 Wow that definitely sounds like a crazy situation!
Way to live vicariously!
What caused you to be freaked out over the finished basement? Sounds good all around.
Well actually I think that makes sense considering you were a kid and you were use to them being with you upstairs.
Was it really nice out? I love being able to go out and just listen to the sounds of the outdoors.
Thats great! I hope it was an all around good day for you.
Thatss great! I bet hes been working really hard.
It feels really good to be recognized for your efforts!
What was the movie? Im always looking for something new to watch with my kids!
I will have to check it out! Thanks for the suggestion. 
Id have been nervous too.  Did you find out if you got the job?
Thats awesome.  Im so happy for you.
Wow that must of been a trip. How did it make you feel?
Awesome Ive gone through old albums like that before as well and it always makes me feel good.
I think many children including myself stole things before they were taught it was wrong to steel.
I would not beat yourself up over the mistake. We all make mistakes even when we are older and should know better. 
That sounds really great!  Do you like them as much as you remembered?
haha I felt the same when I read some of my old baby sitters club books
Oh no Im sorry to hear that. Do they have any idea what the cause may be yet?
I hope its nothing too serious. My younger brother had the same problem early on but he turned out to just be a slow developer.
I totally know how you feel. I have 2 kids and they were a handful as toddlers.
I know right? Grandparents are the best lol
Im sorry to hear that are you alright?
Thats understandable life goes so fast that its easy to lose touch with people you care about. All I can do is try to limit that occurrence.
Thats cool. Are you a big fan of her?
That msut be exciting then I hope the tickets arent too expensive.
Oh that sucks I hate seeing friends and family injured or sick. Thats very nice of you though that you stayed there with him youre a good friend.
Thats awesome good friends are always there for each other.
Oh I know the feeling! I had the same affinity for swimming. My mom said I should give it a try. At first I didnt want to but as I got better I started to love it.
We dont have to be the best to enjoy what we do right?
I had a similar experience playiing little league baseball. How is your daughter feeling about it so far?
I feel you on that. I dont know if I could let my son play baseball after what I went through. I hope your daughter has a better experience.
That sounds relaxing!  Quality alone time is important in a relationship
I can imagine!  Its hard being apart but it makes it that much more exciting to see each other again.
Oh no I had a older cousin who did that to me as well. Hopefully she was just giving you tough love or discipline.
Yeah it really teaches you! I would always sit down where i was and start crying.
When you tripped over the branch did you get hurt?
I hope you were able to laugh about falling and looking silly and not be too embarrassed?
Yeah it really isnt for everyone i like my alone time but only for a while. Afterwards i feel alone and wanting to talk to someone.
Thats the perfect time to just pamper yourself. I cherish those few hours every day!
Yeah I probably would have to leave someone at home with the baby.
Thats great the first time for everything is scary.
I bet it felt good to conquer the fear! Would you skydive again?
Did you enjoy the experience?
Yes he is good for finding answers we cant find ourselves.
Yep I do the same thing as well. Sometimes its just best if you let others help you do something.
Nice its been a while since ive anticipated any new games. what game is it?
Hah i played the first one a ton on ps3 Wish they would release it for pc. 
That sounds horrible. I would be so mad at them.
The level headed approach will probably accomplish more anyway. Im sure they have money so I also hope they dont take yours.
Sounds fair. How hungry are you right now?
Haha I understand. Its like those cartoons where the smell is dragging someone through the air.
Wow what a find cherish that quilt and keep it safe from harm!
Yeah and dont repair it! I think it gives it a history and makes it even more valuable.
Oh damn that sucks. Have you guys talked or did you immediately cut him off?
Man thats terrible I hope you can forget about him and find someone better.
I get where youre coming from my mom supports both of my sisters. It can make you feel less important. hopefully you are getting along though?
Im sure your parents are proud of your ability to take care of yourself. 
Did you and Joe do well?
Being on a team with someone more skilled than you has it advantages its good that he lived up to those expectations.
Thats reasonable considering how new stuff always looks great and how more fancy stuff may be available and cheap compared to when you made yours.
Thats good it sounds like his bathroom motivated you to take yours to the next level. Thats probably good for society.
Yes its annoying! People should put more thoughts into it before they decide to be so opinionated...
Oh yes I know. Some breeds get bad raps and people are so quick to judge! I used to have a pit bull who was a sweetheart!
Wow! That is a huge move! How long ago was that and are things going well? Do you miss Hawaii?
I can imagine. Hawaii seems like a beautiful place!
Tell me about it. Both of my best friends moved several states away from me.
Yeah Im content being at my home town aswell.
Were you able to get it fixed? Things break at the most inopportune times!
Well hopefully that is keeping you a little cool!
Oh my did you get a sugar rush after that? Your dentist must love you.
Thats not surprising but now your friend knows that you are the undisputed champion.
Oh no! Thats awful. That could be dangerous too!
I bet your neighbor was very appreciative of all of your help. That would have been a daunting task for the elderly neighbor.
Oh grandparents are the best at spoiling grandchildren! I could understand that being important to her.
Wow! Do you think whoever inspected it missed something or 3?
I bet. I wouldnt want to get stuck with a money pit either. I hope your state has a lemon law.
Excellent. Well there is some silver lining in all of this haha.
What an exciting time! Hows he doing with it so far?
Thats awesome! I guess practice does make perfect.
Oh thats awesome! I am an only child but I bet its so cool to watch your siblings grow up like that.
That is amazing and so nice of you!
Ugh! You must have a lot of books! 
Wow! That is incredible! I hope you have somewhere to put them all. 
Wow! Congratulations! That sounds like a wonderful thing to do. Was it just the two of you?
Aw that is so sweet. That sounds like the most special day. 
Were you jittery at all? I know I was when I was getting ready for mine
Thats awesome. I hope it was an amazing ceremony. Weddings are always so much fun and romantic.
Uh oh. Dealing with bad neighbors is just the worst! Do you think hed be mad if you asked him to fix the fence?
I wish you luck and hope everything ends up going well. 
Well at least he knew what he was getting into right from the start lol.
We all have those moments. Im glad yours worked out so well.
Nice gotta be prepared. Hope the party went well. 
An endless flow of booze is the key to a successful party sounds like it was a good time.
Dont give up! You will find a better place and it will be the perfect fit.
Everything happens for a reason. I think you will realize that and this could be a good thing is disguise.
How was the response to your ad?  Did you get rid of everything you wanted to?
Thats good people on Craiglist can be pretty shifty sometimes.
What kind of things did she give you?  Were they things that you asked for before?
I would be the same way.  I dont trust anyone to hold on to my comics other than myself.
Aw that is so sweet. I am guessing you and your brother were close?
Awww that is too bad. Hopefully you get to video chat with him
Oh no! Thats awful! Are you still in pain?
I cant believe it! How could they? Im so sorry to hear that...
I understand that going through those albums can really make you think about how peaceful things used to be.
Thats the real trick to it you have to try to move passed all the bad stuff and remember all the good times.
Thats awesome what great news! Im sure your friend was really frightened at the prospect of cancer.
Yeah send them my regards. Its a fantastic day when you wake up cancerfree.
I think we all do that with our siblings. Im sure he knows you still enjoy spending time with him anyway.
Im glad you were able to remedy the situation so easily! I think that shows you have a really good relationship with him.
Oh Ive been there! So much fun!
Did you guys play all the carnival games?
Oh my god I bet you were grossed out but laughing at the same time.
I really hope that is the last time it happens.
Congratulations that is so exciting!!!  I know we should only hope for healthy but Ill keep my fingers crossed for pink 
Once you see that little face youll forget everything else no matter which!
Wow that was very generous and courageous for her! How are they now?
Thats great to hear. What a great story. Very inspiring. Im so happy they are both healthy now.
you need to rest to the competition
ahhh ok you do not participate in that competition
Well as a fellow human being I agree that when parents care for their children it creates a lifelasting bond between the two parties.
I also enjoy the love of my human parents and my human family. They take no hesitation in their focus on of their love for me.
Oh nice! That is exciting! What kind of car did you get?
Wow so jealous! You have to give me a ride one day ok?
Yikes thats a scary situation to be in. Im glad the officer was able to help you.
Thats rough sometimes you really do have to rely on the kindness of strangers.
thats not good did you aplly for any other jobs?
I see that is very understandle. 
Thats awful! I hope you feel better soon.
No problem at all. Glad to make you feel somewhat happier 
That is so wonderful! I have 3 children myself and I love having grandparents to rely on. 
I definitely dont! I had a horrible experience the one time I used a hired babysitter and now I only leave my little ones with family.
Im glad you have someone to rely on for support.
Oh no! I hope no one got in trouble! 
Id say so. Thats so disheartening. Im sure it was accidental. 
Well that sucks. I hate it when animals are abandoned.
Yeah that makes me sad too. I feel bad for them because they dont understand why she isnt with them anymore.
That is great news. I think you just might be nervous. They wouldnt have promoted you if you couldnt do it.
Well usually when you think the worst it turns out to be okay. I think you should try and relax.
What do you guys do for work? You sound like doctors
Thank you for all that you do! I have a friend whos an EMT and I bet its taxing work.
I am so sorry to hear that. Are you feeling nauseated? 
Youre not grossing me out at all. Im a ParamedicFirefighter so it takes alot to get me squirming. I hope you feel better. Drink lots of Gatorade and water to rehydrate so you dont feel awful tomorrow and try to get your hands on some Zofran for the Nausea. 
Absolutely! Feel better soon!
Big change! both big cities though right? Ive always wanted to see that shiny bean thing in chicago. 
I hope you continue to adjust to your new surroundings maybe you will end up loving Dallas who knows!
Woah I hope no one was hurt
I bet! Sounds like it would be a big shock
Ew thats really disturbing.  The sight of cockroaches always gives me the willies.
Yes I shudder to think of the condition of the rest of the home if the car seat is like that.
Oh that must be nervewracking! 
Patience isnt always a virtue that I am good with either. You should feel confident in your work!
Uh oh. Do you think she will be mad when she finds out?
Oh she will be none the wiser. But dont feel bad sometimes you have to indulge and I would figure you still left her some.
that must be a heart warming reunion to see your old patience
that is really good to hear I bet they loved seeing you again
Oh no did they disappear for good or did someone turn them in?
That would be so scary. I actually left my credit card at a restaurant yesterday. Thankfully they held onto it for me. 
I was sure to check my statement and make sure there were no suspicious transactions. 
Wow! So have you tried any methods to get them back on track? Someone might have advice on Youtube.
Ah! Sounds like you need a Cat Whisperer!
Oh no that would make him quite young. Im so sorry! Do you have plans for another one when youre ready?
Those are awesome dogs Ive known quite a few in my life. Well whenever youre ready I think itll be a perfect match.
Aww thats good! Its nice to have to someone you can do that with
Yeah the comfort in that can feel amazing
Ahh thats so anxietymaking. I hope he gets the jon.
Oh thats a terrible problem!  Thats the only time I dont envy homeowners!  I could not afford that at all.  
Its great you have a college fund though!  My kids are very young we havent started that yet.  Although we probably should. How long have you ahd yours?
Okay then youre waaayyy ahead of me! 
I can see why it was hard to quit!  Do you like your job now?
That sounds tough.  It seems like you guys at the daycare went through a lot together.
That is an amazing feeling. I have three daughters. It doesnt matter how many you have the first time you hold them its amazing.
Thats awesome. I would love to have a boy too but Im not sure if I want another one or not. 
My youngest is 3 and almost completely potty trained but its been a struggle. Maybe when she starts school Ill make up my mind.
Yes and thats what we did with her. her sisters were a 8 and 9 when she was born.
That was really nice of you! Im sure they appreciated the gesture.
Its important to care for the older generation who once cared for us. 
Fantastic! Why kind of story is it?
I see! Have you gotten any other works published?
Yikes! did you figure out what it was?
It must have been awfully windy.
Did you have to move there for a job?
Im in the Midwest so can sympathize with you there.  Are you going to live there permanently now?
Oh that sounds scary! Did you find out what it was?
Well it was probably nothing to worry about because you seem alright now. 
Wow thats a lot of people.
I know the feeling. I get sick around crowds.
Oh boy I hope he is careful with your car
You are a good friend! That was very generous of you
I would have been so scared!  I dont understand having dogs off leash.
So reckless!  Its really not that hard to leash dogs.  And with the baby there too ugh.  I cant imagine.
Ouch! Kids have a tendency to learn things the hard way. Was he okay?
Thats good! My son is always running into stuff! He needs bubblewrap to keep him safe.
Im sorry. They grow up fast. Its hard to watch them leave the nest.
That can help. I know I like my hobbies lol.
That sounds cool but also too good to be true. I hope it is true though
Fry some for me too!
No I havent. You are such a great person! I wish to have grandchildren like you someday.
You are kind and sweet. Please never change.
Oh no ! Were you able to come up with something else to say ?
I understand but I bet you did well in spite of that !
Tough! Are you planning on getting it fixed? 
Well at least that sounds like an easy fix! Often times those repairs can get pricy!
Wow you are a lucky man! Good to have a psychologist in the family too.
I wish you both all the best and hope that you have a wonderful life together!
Wow! That must have taken a lot of guts but I hope it was worthwhile.
Oh no why were you so scared?
that is probably for the best you dont want to get involved with that stuff
Could be worse than aliens someone could hurt you. you know ?
Oh my! Well I bet he quit making fun of you in light of his own embarrassment.
An alien? Wow.
That sounds difficult. Did you try talking to people in your neighborhood?
That always sucks. But old people are great and sometimes funny to hang out with. Maybe you should try giving them a go!
Did you get the money back quickly?
Thats a great friend. Loyalty and honesty are everything in a relationship. 
Oh wow! That really sounds like your brother is going through a rough time.
I hope everything works out family is everything.
Oh that is so sweet! I love baby kittens. Are you going to keep it?
I think you should. There are so many animals that need a good home.
Thats nerve wracking. I have 4 kids myself so I know what its like.
Most of the time they do do well. We definitely have to trust our husbands to look after the little ones without us.
Thats an incredible act of kindness for a stranger. Did they return the tool? Was the tool in normal shape when you got it back?
Hes probably very grateful for your kindness. Hopefully hell return the kindness to someone else.
Awww!  Was its momma nearby?
The kitten might have been dehydrated.  Hopefully the neighbor called someone else to come help?
I hope the results are good. What were you getting tested for?
Dont sweat too hard. Try to focus on positive aspects of life right now because whatever happens that positivity will carry you.
did your parents have to pay to send you elsewere?
that is good i glad you were able to move
They grow up so quickly!  How old is he now?
Yeah mine just started 5th and hes in a different building and changing classes and its a huge difference from 4th grade.
wow that must be gross i know it would make me feel like throwing up too
dont blame you but as a parent you must see a lot of gross things coming from kids
thats not neighborly of them. i would be upset too
omg did you have a talk with them about how they need to clean up after their dog?
yeah i think everyone has
That is good most people have a hard time in the first week
Did you think a ghoul or monster were in there? I had similar fears growing up.
What did you do to get over the fear?
Makes sense. Well Im glad you finally got some sleep haha.
Have you set up cameras to monitor the property?
Maybe report what is going on to the local PD?
I used to do the same thing when I went on long trips.  I would also bring extra things like blankets if it was winter.
Youre so lucky!  I would do the same except they dont make them in my size.
That is horrible! Why would he do something like that??? Did you do anything to stop him?
Awww. That was so nice of you guys! 
Thats terrible! Did you call and tell management?
Thats frustrating. At least youll get your money back eventually.
Oh no! I hate when that happens. Happens to me all the time. Did he forgive you?
Thats not very nice of him. Is he older or younger?
that sounded like an ambitious endeavor you must have felt sick afterwards
they will never know as long they have candy and you can keep your dark secret to yourself
That sounds really good right about now! 
I may do the same as you because yes this has been an extremely long monday
Man I bet you were devastated did you lose anything else?
I am sorry that happened to you  sometime bad things happen to good people
OMG!  Thats insane.  How did you react?
Uh yeah!  I hope you got everything fixed. 
That sounds wonderful!  Time flies doesnt it?
How long have you and he been together?
I bet you were terrified!  Did everything turn out okay?
Very true!  Im glad it worked for you
Awww. I remember the first time I left my son with the babysitter. So many emotions. How old is he?
I bet it was! I am glad you survived. lol
Thats wonderful!  Do they feel the same way?
Manhattan would be a great place to live. youll love it there
never give up hope one of these days youll be waking up in the middle of Manhattan
Yes several times. I usually just end up cutting the hair shorter to get over it.
I bet Im sorry you got one. All I can recommend is cutting it shorter and let it grow back out. Or find a cool hat.
Yeah it is a solid art for sure.
Id try to get a refund!
whitewater rafting seems like alot of fun. 
fun and dangerous my type of fun. glad you had fun
Dude! That sucks! I am so sorry about that. What happened?
Ugh! That really irritates me. I am so sorry that happened. Too bad they couldnt catch those creeps. 
Thats too bad did you ever get to ride horses at all?
Well I hope you get to be around horses someday!  I dont know much about them but theyre so cool.
wow that must be scary to have someone break into your house
so you had a sentimental attachment to it i understand but as long as you werent harm
oh my gosh did you actually lose the card?
It is I have had that happen with 2 of my cards and my debit card. I managed to track down through the charges who used the cards
Oh you go girl! What did you do?
Awww what a sweet woman you are. There arent too many like you out there anymore. 
Oh wow! I would be furious to say the least
Well thats good and hopefully the next one doesnt do it too
i dont blame you for siting around all day. 60 miles I dot think i walk that in year
you deserve the rest after this week must be a great feeling to accomplish what you did
oh that is terrible it feels like your life is changing so fast did everything turn out ok?
that is a scary situation so glad everything turned out ok
Oh no. That sucks. Good thing you were close to home. 
Oh no! That sounds scary. 
that is so kind of you we once adopted an abandon dog
i do not know either it is sad when a dog is abandon by their owners
Those are nothing to mess around with. They can be deadly.
No kidding. I would hate to have to come face to face with one.
OMG that is horrible!  Im sure she needs you right now
I just can not imagine the heart ache! Poor baby
That is really gross. How did that happen??
Oh I see. So nothing really bad that could cause a problem really. lol
I dont think I would help again unless someone found me a face shield.
Table tennis is a wonderful game. Did you beat him?
Aw Im sorry you didnt win. Maybe next time. 
A delicious delicacy! Why were you stressed?
Oh! Bummer. Yeah stress gets to me too! Did you end up passing it?
That sounds like a great dog! what bread is he?
Labs are known for their loyalty and obedience. I bet he is a great companion 
Oh that sounds awful. Just makes things worse when they show up?
Well it sounds like youve done alright so far Im sure the worst is behind you.
That was super nice of them I bet it was a big surprise as well.
I love my kitchenaid. It has to be my most used appliance. I can see why you were so happy.
Oh that little rat! That was not nice of him. What did you do?
Awesome! There needs to be more people like you in this world. 
That is unfortunate how long have you been friends with this person?
There is surely a reason why. Did she have many family members as bridesmaids?
You are so lucky ! I still keep my 9 month old fur baby on a leash. What breed is your dog ?
Mine is a German Shepherd.  It is amazing how they walk so close to us almost tripping over us in our path !
Oh thats so sweet that he taught you to play he sounds like he was a sweet grandpa.
Well hang onto those tight and maybe you can teach someone to play chess in the future.
Thats great. I hope you do well in your new job.
Im sure it was but it always a great idea to be looking to improve yourself or your position. Do what is best for you.
they probably think you are part of the Thai family
but it must be great food if you keep going back
I do the same. At least were contributing to somebodys fortune.
Oh no that sounds terrible. I would hate to have such a financial burden suddenly sprang on me.
Im sure youre not the only one. 
Oh what did you find? hopefully not something ebarassing?
Oh that is awesome what did you find?
Thats good to hear! Why?
Wow you definitely should be excited and looking forward to it!
that sounds great what did your dog do?
its satisfying when your pet does a trick it feels like you and your pet accomplished something meaningful
Oh? What surprised you about today?
That sounds wonderful! Im sure that felt great.
Aww that is very sweet kind and thoughtful of you! Has it been troubling for you because I am sure you also have a busy schedule
That is good but if it ever becomes too stressful for you I hope that you are able to talk to your friend about it because there are plenty of alternative ways to get her mother to the hospital.
Thats a nice gesture of her. Its nice that she trusts you like that.
Well obviously youre the more deserving one.
i love peaceful moments while relaxing. i bet that moment was much needed . i really like nature too
i like to garden so i know what you mean 
Oh I cant wait to hear!
Wow you trusted he would give it back and then he didnt. I can understand how angry youd be!
Oh haha sorry I misread that! And that is great I am so excited to meet the bunny!! Do we have a name for it yet? 
Oh dang that sounds really scary. Im assuming that since youre still here that you are okay?
You should probably stay out of that neighborhood in the future. Glad youre okay. Stay safe out there.
Oh man I hate it when my dog starts barking at the neighbor dogs too. Id be so mad at him for getting out though.
Oh man that sounds super scary. Im so glad your dog is okay I would be lost if amything happened to mine.
Omg my current dog does that sometimes. She pukes up bile if she doesnt eat so I always have to make sure she is eating her food.
Oh gross that is disgusting. I hope your little buddy is okay though. I dont envy you at all.
Oh Fun! where did you go?
Did you have to go far?
Im jealous P I need a vacation. The beach is so relaxing too 
That must have taken a lot of courage. What happened next?
Thats great that you could do it. Maybe next time will go better.
Oh man.  Thats a terrible feeling. What did you do?
that must be cool to see something to break up the monotony of the day
that must have been a sight to see
what it is?
I bit it is a good and funny memory.
Oh no please tell me that did not happen to you today.
Oh no I hope you were alright! But yes that is a funny story to tell your friends  
You must feel terrible. That sucks.
Eh next year theyll have forgotten it mostly
Oh wow that is interesting. I assume he leaves at night to go eat since hes still alive.
Hmmm I guess you could look for the hole during the day and try patching it when the bats fly out for the evening? Im not a bat expert lol.
Oh how was that? Ive never been to camp. Was it fun at least?
Thats great Im glad you had fun. What was your favorite activity?
I have been to Six Flags as a matter of fact.  I cant say that I enjoyed it much as I hate to ride rides.  WHat about you?
I can so relate to your experience!  WHen I was a child my parents would try to coax me to ride and I hated it. I rode the ferris wheel once and started crying!
Omg that had to be embarrassing and a mess to get up.
Oh no even worse. Hope you got the job 
Im glad youre feeling better. Im sorry you went through that I hear that addition is tough and often starts after having a major surgical operation.
Im glad you got the help you needed and ended up in an actually helpful rehab. Its always good when you have control of the things in your life. Just remember to stay strong when things get tough again and to lean on your support structure. 
Im so sorry to hear that. She is lucky to have you checking on her you sound like a good friend.
Im glad to hear it. Whats got you so?
Wow! Thats unbelievable. Congratulations! How much did you win?
Wow! that is some real dedication you have! Did you manage to pass the test? 
Wow that is great! I am so proud of you. And hey it never hurts to study more.  
Haha! Poor you. Did you wreck your clothes?
I hope you didnt get burned too badly! I fall a lot. It never stops being embarrassing.
Oh I bet probably made you feel sick to your stomach after.
Thats good easy to quickly notice that awful taste.
Oh wow! Where did all of this take place? Sounds like a rough part of town?!
I only used to watch Rugrats and I still cant stand that show.  It was like the decline of the NIck lineup. 
I dont blame them.  The characters were annoying and the color palate was horrible.
Wednesdays why is that? I used to love Wednesdays because we always got out of school an hour early
Oh my fiance loves comics he buys and sells them. Why is that the only thing to look forward to?
Aw why is that? 
Oh thats hard but Im sure you will get yours too. Its hard being patient though when others get theirs before you.
Probably not but I dont remember. I was always a scaredy cat as a baby. Have you?
What a lovely memory! Thats hilarious that your dad made you go back and return it! 
That is not good what happened?
Well I hope you here back from them and they will give good news.
That happened my freshman year with my best friend. It really sucks at first but eventually you get used to it.
Im still friends with my old roommate but I found other people to spend my time with.
What is happening tomorrow night?
Nice I hope you have a great time at the party! Have some fun for the both of us!
Did you ever get your own snowboard ? It looks like so much fun ! I see people on tv where they are flying off mountain sides !
Thats wonderful. Oddly shaped Christmas presents usually make you want to open them EARLY just to get a peak 
Oh wow letting the dog roam free even when its so new to the neighborhood? That seems like recipe for disaster. Your poor newspaper..
Maybe an airhorn or something would spook him off. Dogs tend not to like loud sounds after all. 
Nice! Have you been getting lucky recently?
Wow! You are already super successful! I hope you help them kids!
do tell  what happened was it bad?
that is bad . goodness the nerve of some people.
Oh no were you able to find your dog again? 
Aww I am so glad that you were able to find him again! A dog truly is a mans best friend.
How did that work out?
Well thats good. Im glad so far it has worked out 
I would not of been happy with that were you?
Aint that a whopping  I would have compained to somebody about it.
Not that I can remember. If I did it would not have been too severe. Have you?
As I a child I imagine that would be incredibly scary. How did you find them again?
Oh gross makes me never want McDonalds again.
Why! What happened?
Wow. I am disappointed in you too you monster 
Oh no! Did he replace it?
I get that. My sister broke my favorite coffee mug.
Dang! Your dog must have been so excited to see you come back!
Oh no did you ask if they were alright and apologize? 
Oh no how did he take it? 
I am a little too. Why are you scared?
Yeah I can relate to that. I hate feeling like I dont know what dangerous marine life could be around me.
Awesome! Nothing like stringing together a long streak of feeling happy in the world. Anything in particular got you chipper?
Aww thats tremendous. Those are big steps but if ever there is a goodsign of a relationship its when those topics are approached happily. Congratulations!
Yeah I know what you ean! I have been to one before too and it was awesome! 
haha yeah I know what you ean but at least you know it is fresh! 
I have had an experience like that. I do believe in ghosts.
Could be either!
Oh god I hate bugs!
Ugh thats no fun especially with it being so cold.
Well thats good. Hopefully didnt take long to open up roads.
Wow. What for? Had you recently talked to her?
I bet you guys had a lot of catching up to do!
Aww! what for?
My dog needs some good training!
Friends really are the best part of life Id say. I cant imagine what Id do without some of those folks in my life. 
Thats a good friends right there. Looking out for your best interests is a sign that theyre truly a keeper.
Oh no did he place the blame on you or did he just accept it and take the blame for you? 
Aw that just shows that he is a great friend. Maybe you can treat him to lunch for the rest of the week for taking the fall for you. I am sure he would really appreciate that  
Oh thats awesome. Do you like her?
Thats great nothing better 
Thats good! Cheating is not good for a relationship.
For sure. I luckily have not had anyone cheat on me.
I cannot imagine. Where from?
Can you facetime them?
I understand. I have had to do that before. My family was very giving.
I had to borrow money to get a second degree. Hurt my pride but its okay.
Good for you! Im glad you were able to face it by yourself. Where were you flying?
Cool! Was that your first time flying by yourself?
Wow thats amazing! Did you enjoy the flight back or were you still scared?
Nice what show?
No I havent. Ive heard of it though. What is it about?
Oh my goodness! That happens to me often. I just get distracted with whatever is playing in front of me and eat everything in my hands!
I would think that being an only child would be somewhat boring and lonely.   HOw bad can it be with your brother?
Thats not cool!  I hope you did well in spite of not having your lucky pencil.  Siblings can be quite pesky at times!
Wow did anyone see?
Well I hope it does not happen again!
Oh no! How so?
A stripper I see. Well what she does not know will not hurt her.
I know someone with that. She might need some medication.
Wow hope it wasnt serious.
Why didnt you perform well?
Oh Congrats on your newborn.
That must have really hurt. When did you realize he was always lying to you?
Are you still friends?
Im so sorry. That is horrific.
I hope you are in some therapy. That can take a toll on the average person.
I had never visited there. But it reminds me of Athenas and that old cities
Do u remember the name of that Island? 
I would like to visit it one day too
I agree. I am watching pictures of it right now
Aw that is really sweet of him. What did the note say?
Wow. That is incredibly romantic. Youre a lucky girl! 
Mine passed away too. She was a great woman.
I bet they love games.
Nice how long do you usually take your dog for a walk?
Your dog must be very healthy !
Im so sorry! Report him!
You are much better off
What did you make?
I would love some of that right now.
Why!? What happens next week?
Dang! I hope you got them big discounts before you ordered them!
They are. I have several.
I have a few bears.
Im so sorry. You should talk to a therapist.
Im sorry. Maybe she just needs time to process things.
What!? Did anyone see?
Dang it must have been embarassing
Who are you referring to?
Oh no. That sounds awful. Im sorry to hear abut your friend. Is he better now?
Congregation but what are you passionate about?
how was the weather?
Wow! Must have been really really important
Oh then its okay
whoa thats nuts. how many did you have to kick to get out alive?
oh good. well what did they end up wanting?
well I hope youre ok now
oh sweet how many do you own now?
Its always good to unwind after a tough day. How did you celebrate?
Erm. Well I hope that comes true for you. Betting better can sometimes be more about believing it. Maybe your cat believe he is fine.
My cat is doing good.   Hes gained some weight since I trimmed his fur. NO more hairballs.
Oh shoot why is that?
That may be gross but she is just putting effort into her appearnce.
howd they react?
oh man that sounds embarrassing. I wouldve just run out of the store and country
You should be able to trust that he wont do anything shady when he talks to other girls. If you cant trust him then that might mean you need to reevaluate your relationship with him. 
Oh Do you think you did well?
Wishing you all the best!!
Have you ever kept secrets from her?
It must be nice to be in trusting and safe relationship like that.
Its good you made that decision
Who are they you are referring
Dang! Did they get home safely?
I wish I had a cool friend like you!
Its good that your wife trusts you
You two are lucky to have each other!
THat is extremely noble of you!   YOu did the right thing!!
I would too.  I have lost things before and never had anyone turn them in and its not a good feeling.
Dang! Maybe you can send me some too
Dang was it from craigslist?
I am too scared of getting scammed from those
Dang! What kind of games did you play?
I heard it is one of the best games of this generation!
praying wont do anything but did you study well?
and what was that?
Did he exceed your expectations?
That is the thing about athletes it is crazy how gifted they are compared to an average person.
Family is one of the most important things to have in life. 
Yes your a lucky person and Im happy for you.
Yes I do
Wow you must be very proud of her
Yes Hurricane Harvey destroyed my city!
Dang well I hope these things dont happen again!
I bet you are  So did she just purchase a new house?
That is incredible  my dad had canswer and we had people from our church pray for him and others did as well and his cancer went into remission.
Wow  thats a significant amount of time! How has that been for you?
It sounds like you really care about her. I hope everything works out great for you guys!
Oh my! I hope that he did not feel badly about it. That sort of thing is normal for children
Aw I love that he had you there with him when it happened. I bet that made it feel a bit better for him
That is amazing! A parent will always love their children regardless of past decisions. How did you find her?
That is truly amazing! I wish you the best of luck! And I am sure she loves you still!
No. I have kids but they are toddlers.
I imagine. I left my parents and my country when I was 25 years old. 
I bet that makes you angry  mine use to do the same thing and it made me furious.
HJow do you put up with it  I Know I could not do it.
What!? Whats going on?
That is very unfortunate I hope things turn around for you my friend!
Why? Did he do something terrible?
Wow he is super rude! Beat him up!
Dang! Do you look like your parents?
Yup time goes by too fast!
Financial stress can be a major burden. How did you get over this issue?
That is a smart and well thought out plan
Would you be able to forgive her for such a large mistake?
That is true. And the mistake would not happen again so you do not have to worry about that
I can understand that. It took me many years before I learned to have complete faith in my wife.
The only thing I can tell you is to have faith in her judgement. If you ever lose it it is time to cut your losses and run because it will only lead to hurt and ruin.
Love her while you can and enjoy your life together. Children grow up fast i have two a six year old girl and a nine year old boy. They are handfuls
Does your boss call on you a lot?
You should keep your head down not make eye contact and make a mean face! He wont call on you then!
Thats really kind of you. What good customer service!
You deserve a raise for that mentality
Wow that is impressive! how long did you train for it?
Oh no! did you get hurt?
That is scary! I am glad you played it safe and decided to stop! there is always another marathon to run!
Absolutely! And I am sure next time you will be able to finish 
Wow! Did you punish him or anything?
Well I hope he learns his lesson!
Why thats not good
What do you plan to do
result for what
yeah you clearly are well read. what does he study?
Nope it is too scary for me!
Nice I hope I can overcome my fear one day too!
ah I was never much of a sports guy but I do work out a lot. do you still play?
and now theyre rattled around by 250lb guys smashing into you
haha yeah. Im worried about hurting myself by working out too hard
haha I wish it was that simple
Congrats!!!! It is an amazing experience! I just had a little baby girl 3 weeks ago
Take it one day at a time man. It is a truly amazing thing. You will love that baby with all your heart
I understand. Just be supportive as your girlfriend is probably thinking the same thing. Just remember you are now both in this together so enjoy the experience.
Wow what kind of exams are you taking?
Sounds hard! I hope you do well in your exams!
Thats very trusting. Did they come back with the milk?
Good for them. Nice to know that there are good people left in the world
Sometimes it can get tricky when family and money are involved. Did he pay you back?
Oh man! I hope it all works out for you. 
whatd he do?
well maybe you should find another job
Who did he bit
What can you do to help him stop drinking
Wow congrats! Is it a boy or a girl?
Dang well I hope she has a wonderful future!
I hope there was a good reason for that!
Maybe you should talk face to face with him next time you see him.
I talked with my boss recently because I thought he was angry at me but it turned out he was just having problems at home.
I am sure everything will work out just fine!
Why? what is in that room?
The same habit that I took up
Really?  Have you watched any zombie movies or shows lately?
Well that might explain it those zombies arent very nice!
Cute!!! what did you name it?
What kind of dog is she?
I find them creepy too. I am actually very scared of them.
Oh no thats pretty gross! I hope that is not true because if it is that is gross.
Have you voiced your opinion to him yet?
Parents always think they know best. Until their children prove them wrong they tend to think that. 
What kind of e
As youre hopeful you will get it
Im sorry to hear that. are you angry at him?
well you better make sure of that. tell him if he forgets again youll divorce him
youre very lucky to have such family! when are you getting married?
well  thats insane! im glad you find you life partner  and i hope everything goes the way you guys planned !
Wow that is a long time! How did you do?
Exactly! that is a great outlook to have. You did your best and as long as you are happy personally all the rest does not matter
Oh no! Have you ever had one before?
Yeah but sometimes these things cant be avoided.
You are so luckyi have been long for such a break for so long.
You get relaxed and even get more productive when you get back to work. 
That is amazing! It is nice to hear that things are going so well for you and your family!
That is wonderful! I wish you and your family the best! Sending positive energy love and light your way.
Is it just temporary?
Sometimes things are a necessary evil. And who knows as long as you keep your options open the perfect job may be right around the corner.
oh dear that mustve been embarrassing are you okay though?
i hope that you didnt get hurt
Girlyou are so lucky. You got a good one. better things are on the way for you.
On my 30th birthday my wife bought me my dream car. A Jeep. I never saw it coming.
its nice to have someone who can help you always im pretty sure she loves having you by her side always
she probably appreciate you so much for doing that. 
Thats too bad. I cant have dogs in my apartment either. Why wont they let you have one?
Our second family dog died last year. She was the runt of the litter so it was a surprise since she was a small dog.
Ah thats so exciting! Is he looking forward to it?
Thats so cool Im sure hell love it and make some great friends!
Do they have any sentimental value for you?
Well then maybe it is time to get rid of them?
Wow did you fall on your butt that hard?
That is unfortunate but funny at the same time!
why are you scared of leaving your current job? if you have been offered a better job then just leave you know?
maybe you should ask i think thats the easiest way of discovering what is better for you!
What made it hectic?
oh I understand. Was it a long interview?
Uhnnnmost of us did!
What about the cats though?
You monster! Everyone loves animals
What have you eaten?
You are living life. 
Dang that is very unfortunate.
At least you have a wife. Probably would if it werent for fights over dumb things.
Did you feel scared?
Was the drive a necessary one to take?
Uhmnnnyou really did?
Did you have a sum inside?
Its always good to have a boss you can get along with.  It makes work a lot less stressful.
Yes a boss who is helpful and has a good attitude will have earned my loyalty from the beginning.  The better I feel about work the better I perform in the long run.
Tell me morei would love to know!
Perfect state of mind.  I will take that any day.
your friend is probably one of the luckiest people on earth. how do you feel about it
well you know everything happens for a reason. 
of course I would
What made you do that?
Oh I hate group work for that exact reason. Id rather just have company while I did the work
What a shame. I wouldnt make them my partner again. and I might venture so far as to notify the professor
I am so sorry to hear about your dog. What happened to him?
At least he lived a long happy life. 
im pretty sure they were more than happy to help you because they are your parents in the end.
see? they cant get mad at you so you shoudnt feel ashamed instead search for another job and help them.
You are so hyped for the day. I wish that will be the same for me.
It pays to always be kind. Even if you dont get rewarded immediately but at least you helped someone.
mind telling me what happened maybe i could help you?
you dont deserve a best friend like that. or even a relationship where you have to keep fighting for the attention. i suggest you leave both of them and look for your future with other people!
Thats great. I never did a long distance one. But my brother did and it was about 400 miles.
She was a keeper though Im sure it was worth it for him.
good for you. where have you been?
whatd you do there?
oh I see. do you have kids together
Great what happend?
Cool I never played the drums. My band teacher in middle school tried to discourage playing the drums cause there are no notes!
sounds like a good adventure! where are you going to climb?
well hopefully you wont die. be careful and make sure you have fun!
I hope it turned out great. Did you find a good hairdresser to do your hair?
Oh Im so sorry that happened to you. I really hope you were able to get the color fixed eventually.
Oh Im so sorry to hear that how long have they been gone.
Oh wow....I hope you can get through it.
That must have been embarrassing. Did the girls get in trouble for it?
I would have switched schools if I were you. I would hate to have to be with bullies like that
Did she punish you?
I hope she didnt make you feel too bad about it! People make mistakes when theyre young.
Thats terrible. Hopefully things right themselves for you soon.
The plus side about schools is that someone else will do something that everyone will focus on soon enough.
Was the guitar okay?
I stepped on my uncles fishing pole kinda hard to tell if it catches fish worse or not.
holy cow! Why did she go to jail?
Im glad yall were able to make it through such a hard time.
Woah I never had that happen to me.
Yes we can truly not judge people because unless you are very close with a person you cant know their full story!
I am sure that was difficult.  How is he now?
I am so sorry for your loss.  It can be a relief to know he isnt in pain.  I felt the same way when I lost my Aunt last year.  She was like a mom to me.
How did the school feel about it? Dont they have strict rules about that?
Thats funny and unfortunate at the same time. I really hope your son was okay and not too traumatised by the experience!
Wow that would have scared me how did it go?
thats good I have 2 teenage daughters and dread the idea of leaving them by themselves
Thats a really big change are you nervous?
10 years of teaching experience Im sure youll end up having a great year! Dont stress too much.
if you regret what you did you should go apologise for you said to him!
i hope he can forgive you and help you forget about what you said.
youll need to be careful around me then. Im the type of person who takes advantage of people
yeah but maybe well fall in love instead?
Why? Whats happening today? 
Oh my goodness. I really hope youre right and that the results come out negative.
You want cancer results to come out negative for cancer not positive for it.
thats amazing. where was the concert? and how many people were participated?
cool!! even i wanted to learn guitar.. but have no time for it
did he came back to take it?
you are a trustworthy person glad he forgot it at your place not somewhere else
I think a lot of people feel the same its natural. Is there anything in particular that youre scared of happening? 
There is a lot you cant control in life though. If you focus on the things you can control then it might stop the negative feelings about things you cant control
Im sorry about that. What did he do?
Wow well he will have to learn his lesson before he will get a job or go to college. That wont work there.
well I mean...does she really? or do you just think she does
well you should be more worried about dying in a car accident because thats 10x more likely. drive safe
thats great what kind of job was it?
Thats great my one son spent time in a childrens hospital and the care was fantastic could not have been happier with them
Thats really interesting. Do you think it benefits them learning from you rather than qualified teachers? 
I suppose as long as theyre happy thats the main thing! It probably benefits them being around other kids their age?
I see being alone can be fulfilling to. It all depends on the kind of person you are.
Yes we can discover our inner worlds whenever were alone!
why? i had the same thing happening to me with my dog. is she somewhere safe though?
thats okay. you can always get yourself another dog.
Thats amazing Its always nice to get on with your family! Have you always got on with them? 
thats so nice to hear. I have always been very close with my family too but I have friends who arent and its horrible
Well if you provided for your childs care then you shouldnt feel bad. I mean this isnt the dark ages.
I am sorry you feel so bad about it. I sincerely believe God will forgive a truly repentant heart.
Thats so good. How old is she?
I know how you feel. Congrats on raising a young adult
thats really nice  its always amazing to have friends who you feel comfortable around. What was the new thing your friend made you do? 
Oh wow! I like getting out of my comfort zone and doing new things its such a thrill. Especially rock climbing  I had a friend who made me do it once too
Do you hate when anybody tells you what to do or just figures of authority? 
would you feel better if it was in the form of advise instead of point blank telling you to do something? 
I think if youre confident in yourself you can talk yourself into most jobs. You should give yourself more credit and not say you were lucky! 
I think so too! I think people should have more confidence in themselves but you always focus on the negative things more than the positive! 
Im so jealous I would eat pizza every day if I could! Whats your favourite pizza? 
Im not a fan of pineapple on pizza!! Pepperoni is by far my favourite 
Im sorry to hear that. What are you studying?
It certainly will.
Thats an amazing attitude. Not many people are like that nowadays.
Crazy world we live in.
Oh wow was in unprovoked? 
Did you try to apologise before she hit you or did you not have time? 
You must be having bitter sweet emotion.I remember my mom was also emotional when i left boarding school for the first time.
But you can make arrangements such that you see him every weekend.
Im sorry to hear that. Did you apologize?
I think if youre respectful and state what you did wrong and how youll fix it she will forgive you.
oh my god how embarrassing was that? 
That is extremely loyal! You must have a really happy relationship? 
It sounds like you really have had a good life so far! It makes me feel happy hearing good news stories like this 
Thats so nice of you. Hardwork pays
Oh yeah you must be a brilliant student
Thats so nice. Who was it from?
That was really nice of her to get it for you. She must love you very much.
Oh no! Thats awkward. Are you able to laugh about it now?
Ha thats good! Ive had so many embarrassing things happen. We all have!
Oh maybe thats a sign to bring fun and adventure in your relationship?
Thats good there is a lot of ways to make the relationship alive and interesting!
Thats such a shame! Were you honest with your friend and did they forgive you? 
If she is that good a friend Im sure shell forgive you soon enough. 
sending my positive vibes to you too! Fingers crossed! 
Oh Im so sorry. Losing a pet is never an easy thing.
I hope you have some friends and family that you can rely on to cheer you up. Im sorry about your cat and I hope you know you gave it a good life!
skydiving is insane to me how did it go? what reminded you of it?
its always good to have a professional help with this kind of things glad you had fun!
Thats incredibly sad Im so sorry for your loss. How long had you had your dog? 
Do you have close friends and family that can help to support you through this time? 
Oh No! What caused so many innocent deaths?
I think war is universal. The causes are many.
did they anything mean to you? 
oh it was an accident and its alright. as long as you make sure that you use the right seasoning next time. its all gonna be okay.
How did you get into this situation? 
well I think she should be the one to get you out of it! Otherwise perhaps you could see a financial adviser. They might be able to help you consolidate your debts 
Well I have never heard of God helping with financial situations but perhaps if you pray and scrape together enough money for a ticket to Las Vegas all your troubles will be gone
This is a lot to ask for. I recommend going straight to the pope for something of this magnitude
Wow! Some delivery driver must be excited about their latest acquisition! 
I didnt mean to sound so flippant. That is a lot of money to lose. Was the item itself expensive also?
Well I hope they can trace it for you. Better late than never. I wish you good luck with that! 
Im really glad to hear that! Thats one of the best feelings I think!
I very much agree! Being grateful is important it keeps you level headed and grounded in life!
oh god that sounds horrifying are you and your family okay?
thats great glad you managed to make everything okay afterwards that mustve been a lot of hard work!
Oh my goodness! Are you and your family safe though?
Thats a relief. You have the people who matter safe and sound the stuff can be replaced in time.
Wellshes your wife after all
Thats women for you.Where you frugal with money?
Oh amazing! How long were you training for and how many people did you beat? 
Thats incredible well done! I injured my knee a few months back so havent been able to run since then. so frustrating
Aaawww  Im sorry you had to go through that
It is really hard to deal with  Especially if you arent nearby. Sounds like you really miss your sweet beast! 
Oh Im sorry you are going through that. Have you tried to go back to your doctor and discuss making some changes?
I hope that you can find a solution to help with that. Good luck!
That must have been so nice for both of you. Had he changed for the better?
People do change a lot when they grow up. I met an old school friend the other day and they were awful now! 
Oh thats so sad im really sorry about that. Is it possible to apply for a loan again in the future for the same house? 
thats such a shame. Im sure something similar will come up soon though 
oh no what a nightmare! Was anyone injured? 
Thats good then as long as no one waa hurt! was he drunk? 
Thats cool a good relationship is based on trust 
Have you always been very trusting? 
I like food.  What kind?
That is a legit lunch.  Solid choices.  A  would eat.
Aw that is very kind of you. I love morning coffee!
Haha! I think a lot of people can probably relate to that. Im sure she appreciates it!
oh no. How bad was it?
I can see how it would make you anxious. 
Is it because you are surrounded by people most of the time? I get that way sometimes too so I can relate.
It is good that you enjoy your alone time. Sometimes we just need a little metime.
That sounds like so much fun! Were you scared?
My daughter got scared of haunted house once. It was hilarious but I sympathise with her and you.
Yuck! At least the cockroach isnt in your kitchen anymore! My cats like to catch mice and bring them to the front door.
I wouldnt have been able to either! Its super gross!
Oh I bet that is frustrating!  Can you report it to someone?
I would feel the same way.  Perhaps you could mention it to your coworker nicely and they will take pity on you.  
What kind of vacuum is it? I bought a Dyson recently and I love it!
Those vacuums are amazing and are one of a kind. You should get it!
Thats so sweet Literately. He seems like a nice guy 
Nice! you are a lucky lady. 
Oh Im sorry that you are going through that. Have you discussed changing your medication up with your doctor?
I hope one day you can find a solution and get back to being the old you.
Oh wow It must have been quite an overwhelming experience for both of you
Congrats because I know you will definitely overcome the pains
Wow! The struggle is real. I hope youre not too tired and stressed. I wish you luck for being so selfless! 
Do twins run in your family or are you just lucky? I mean that seriously not sarcastically 
Thats awesome! You won the kiddo lottery! I wish you all the best of health and happiness!!!

I love boxers they are so cool looking do you plan on getting another one?
Oh wow! Congratulations on getting promoted that is awesome!!
I bet thats usually how it goes but so glad to hear of your promotion. I bet youre super happy!
You are the best wife ever! I cant believe how lucky he is!
What did he get sick with? I hope its not contagious! 
oh yeah did you end up passing?
I remember those days and do not miss them
Thats terrifying!  Did they catch the guy?
Im so sorry.  How are you coping?
You must have been in so much pain. How did you manage to endure it?
It great you were confident despite your illness. Its a sign of good character.
That is awesome and sounds like so much fun! What are you most excited for?
I can relate! I love to tan and havent had the chance to yet either!
I really want to try Yoga! Would you say your back feels better? This sounds so fun!
Im jealous! I wish I could try it out for myself. How long have you been doing it now?
oh thats awesome what kind of puppy did you get?
thats too cool I would love to get a puppy some day
Thats awesome rain is good
oh no. so what do you do in such instance?
Oh my goodness thats terrible. How did you find out?
I believe thats for the best. You should get regularly tested after this. I hope the best for you.
Omg sounds creepy
I am glad you escaped it
Oh no the dreaded fly being down for the big meeting. Howd it go?
Uh oh. I hope whoever saw it had a little chuckle then let it go. Its no big deal.
Thats truly heartbreaking. Were you able to help them? 
Your heart was in the right place. It sad that children cant be fed in our world today. Maybe one day nobody will have to be hungry.
So what happened then
OK now I understand. Maybe she later got a ride home
Wow! How old is your child? Thats very impressive!
Wow! I cant even do that now! I bet you are very proud of her.
Thats unfortunate. Maybe you can have a chat with them about it?
That must be so infuriating. Id get upset if it were me.
Congratulations! How much did you win?
Hey thats awesome. And youre right it doesnt so live it up my friend!
This happened to me! Dont feel bad it happens to people such as us!
Shell forgive you eventually. Youll never make the same mistake again I promise you that!
Has he given you any hints that he might be planning a party? That would be so much fun to be with all your family and friends in one place to celebrate you!!
That is a lot of people!! You are loved and appreciated! Now its time to start planning his suprise birthday
Husbands can be so thoughtful... You have a good one..
Oh no I am so sorry to hear that. That is awful and makes me sad. Have you talked to anyone about it?
Thats what you need to focus on is just giving her all of your love she will cherish it. Im so sorry youre going through this I hope that you can find peace with the situation.
I am glad I hope you have a great day today!
Wow thats so cool of you. You really trust her
I really admire your love life. 
Are you ok? Thats absolutely devastating. I hope you have people to confide in right now.
I hope things get better for you you seem to be a good soul. I pray for your lose.
Im sorry to hear that. While diet is most of it exercise can play a role too. How active is your lifestyle?
I know it might seem like empty words from a stranger but just keep at it. Try as hard as you can to stay positive you will see results trust me.
cant you place a call to them?
I just think you should just be optimistic and patient
Thats amazing! Congratulations. What was the policy that changed?
Well thats great for you. Everybody loves a little extra money!
Im sorry thats rough.  Did you ever find out why?
I guess not but I hope you still had or will have if it hasnt happened yet a great wedding!
That is really scary. Did he ever catch up with you?
Thank goodness. Do you know who he was?
How close did you lose by? I bet at the next competition youll wipe the floor with them.
Understandable when you put so much work into something only to be eclipsed by someone else. Not a good feeling.
Oh my goodness that is so sad I am sorry to hear about your father. Are you handling him being gone okay?
I understand completely. I hope that you can enjoy going to more games and carry on his spirit when you go.
Oh no! That is really embarrassing. Hopefully she can move on from it and you can laugh about it one day.
At least it wasnt something you did on purpose. Im sure it will blow over!
I think its so weird that cats do that. Its like they are bringing us trophies or something!
Yeah I would be a little horrified too if my cat did that! Im dying of laughter thinking about your situation.
Thats so sweet. Its good to have that kind of faith in your relationships.
Congratulations. I hope you stay happy always.
have you called any rescue center yet?
Lets hope it will trace the house back
Oh wow good for you. That education will help you the rest of your life! 
It can be frightening especially with all those new classmates and teachers. 
Oh man I would have been really frustrated. Does she know he is dating you now?
Its never fun to see your significant other around someone they used to date. At least he is with you now and Im sure you have nothing to worry about!
I totally understand the anxiety. You never know if they are baiting you or actually giving you a good deal. Did you get a new car?
Im so happy you were able to get a dependable vehicle. I always have someone come with me as well. Its nice to have a second pair of eyes.
Im so sorry to hear about that it must be awful. Do you have friends and family that you can talk to about this? 
When my relatives have died it helps me to remember the good times and makes me smile instead of being sad
Aw he sounded like such a great friend! 
I am so sorry that is so tragic. At least you have some good memories with him. 
That is so sweet.  I really commend people who treat kids like their own its so important for a kid to grow up feeling like they have a lot of people in their corner.  I have a stepdaughter myself.
Yes its true in life too when you grow up sometimes the best family has nothing to do with blood relations.
Oh no now thats a sticky situation! Howd you manage?
Yeah hopefully all the hoopla over the first day distracted everyone. I am sorry that happened to you though.
Oh man I am sorry! I have been there it sucks! Are you okay though?
I am glad you are okay. I wrecked my favorite car 3 years ago and I still miss it.
Oh really?  What was it for?
Oh wow I can only imagine.  Paperwork is not fun.  I hope you got it all done eventually!
That is great that is the beginning of happiness
Wow that is true love
Wow  thats lovely. So you will start keep fit
It will help you  even in blood circulation 
Oh no! How did they react?
What did you do? I would just laugh it off.
Thats a shame Im sorry. Does she have anything to keep her occupied while you work?
I believe that a lot of people think because youre at home that you have time for things other than work.
I am sorry to hear about your dog passing away. But Im happy you have a new friend in the new one.
Its good you were able to find new companionship in your new dog. Congratulations on your new pet.
I hear you! Is she going out with her girlfriends?
Ahh sounds like a tough situation. Maybe you should try letting your girlfriend know how you feel.
She is a grown women so you cant tie her up or she will choke. I hope everything works out for you. 
How mortifying! Did anyone hear it? Did it smell?
Yikes! I cant even imagine how embarrassing that was.
happy riding to your daughter
please do Asap!
Thats awesome I hope he returns the favor as well.
Thats amazing. Love is absolutely grand. I am happy for you two.
Oh yeah  Ive been there  I really understand 
You will really have enough time to rest
That sounds wonderful!  Do you get to use them yet?
I havent had a chance to try bath bombs yet.  But my daughter inlaw loves them.
Oh no! Kids do that sometimes. What happened?
Its hard when they grow up. Hopefully she will learn from her mistakes.
Oh no! I would be angry too!
Yes they do. Its a season of learning.
Oh that sounds good!  Im sure you studied lots?
That is excellent news.  You must be very proud.
hey thats not too bad how long are you going for?
lol hey a week is a reasonable time to pack three backs I would do the same
Wow how did that almost happen? I would rethink my options.
Good keep temptations at a distance. You never want to mess up a good relationship over a one night stnad.
Did they do a good job of cleaning your house?
That would make me nervous you never know if they are looking through your things. 
That helps a lot with the peace of mind. I am glad it worked out well for you!
It is nice when they can build up that trust with you!
Thats a shame. Do you know who stole it?
Did they take anything else?
Oh no. That happened to my sister last year. We were able to work out a plan but she had to get a loan temporarily.
Thats no fun but I hope everything works out for next semester.
Ok how much raise did you get?
How much please?
Too bad youve been let down so often. Im glad your new worker is satisfactory.
Its good to have someone so trustworthy. Congratulations.
Do you still live nearby?
Its good that you have pleasant memories.  What was your favorite thing about the neighborhood?
Did you like it? What did you buy?
Thats too bad. I hope they didnt charge you for the items they missed.
Im so sorry you must feel terrible. Its their loss in the long run.
I can imagine youre very angry. Youll find someone better.
oh man thats not good at all! Did he break anything?
oh thats really nice of you I am glad hes okay
Its awesome to have a partner like that. Thats certainly why they call it the other half.
I second that. Finding that eternal partner is one of the greatest joys a human being can experience.
Well I toast you to 10 more and beyond.
Oh no! How awful! Did your Thanksgiving improve?
I would be mortified!
Cool! Where did you move too?
Oh that does not seem like such hard work. It is fun to move into new houses. I like moving around.
Oh good! So glad it is all working out. I will come by and say hi one day. Catch you later!
i understand life can do that to you and looking back always bring fond memories
just think today will be tomorrows memories when looking back
Oh! Did you find any good deals?
Uh oh...Was it tainted? I wouldnt risk it...
Flag football is so much fun! What position would you like to play?
You could certainly bring some physicality to the position with your height. I say go for it!
thats really good... I am very sorry for your loss. It sounds cliche but it gets better with time
youre gonna be okay. Its been five years since Ive lost mine. Just keep her close to your heart.
That was so nice of them what kind of pets?
Quite the little zoo.  What a great friend you have!
Im so sorry for your loss!
Oh sorry to hear that. There is something going around these days. I hope they are better now.
That sounds so sweet . Family time is the best!
i know me too! Why are you ready?
yeah it does! Great job man Im proud of you!
you are prepared more than ever !
thats the spirit! always believe in yourself!
I have not I feel like it should be done by a professional. 
Oh no! Probably tons of years of dirt caked into the rug. Did you use the right cleaner?
Maybe the dirt adds to the whole antique feel of them. 
I hope you can find a solution that works for you!
That mustve been fun! What did you guys do?
Oh that sounds like so much fun! sounds like you are very grateful for good friends! 
That sounds like a really lovely way to go somewhere in a car!
On no! Im sorry you were embarrassed but Im sure it sounded wonderful! 
What game do you play?
Ohhhh. What kind of game is it?
wow is it the first time youre gonna see him? is he going to stay at your place?
sounds like you planned for everything! enjoy yourself! 
Thats awesome never settle for less. Always strive for more!
Well hopefully you can still maintain communication with them. Its normal to be nervous though just go in confident
Thats the best way to do it. Read before you buy.
Its amazing how dirty they can get isnt it.
yes my internet provider is notorious for that
oh wow did they justify the overcharge? id dispute it
That must have been a good thing did yall celebrate.
hard work should pay off nice to hear about some one getting back after they put in congratulations.
Yeah my cousin actually borrowed my car to take his driving test
I dont blame you!  He should have been more responsible.
Omg what happened?
Pesky snakes. Was it a black racer? I see those all the time in my yard.
I would too! lol.
Thats awesome! Is something holding you back?
Buying a home can be nerve wracking but in the end its worth it!
Wishing you luck and heres to finding the perfect home!
Sometimes Im worried that Im that family member but Im not sure what to do to make them have confidence in me.
Im happy that your brother is in sobriety now. I hope his life recovers.
I am sorry that happened . I have 3 dogs myself.
Good dogs are hard to vfind I can imagine how sad that must have been.
I enjoy reading.
Its cool that youre such a fan though. I hope the movie lived up to your expectations.
Oh yes I remember those days too so clearly. Such carefree day right?
Yeah it was like the only thing to do in summer. The whole town comes out and the pool is crowded! Oh those were the days!
A what on the handle?
Me too. About friends an d family. Things I got to see and do.
Yes. Some more than others. But sometimes I think its all relative.
Oh no! How did that end?
Thats not good. Im sorry that happened to you.
Oh that is so selfish. Did you try and get back at her?
Thats great says a lot about the type of person you are in a good way! I probably wouldve gone for revenge knowing myself.
Is it because you trust their judgement or is there a different reason?
Thats great that you have that type of relationship with him. My husband and I approach things together and discuss everything which works great for us. You have to do what works for you and your relationship.
Thats always a good thing.
That will be really convenient.  Theres one near us we like to skateboard to.
Oh no! I hate that! So what did you do about it?
Wow no power at home is terrible. What would we do without electricity?!
Poor dog! Did you find out why? Is it better now?
Aww thats cute! I love older dogs but I know it can be scary sometimes when they show signs of poor health. Im glad he was okay!
Oh! What was it about?
I hate clowns! when I try to run I sink into the ground.
Oh no! I hate spiders! Were you able to avoid them and move your pots?
If people knew it was because of spiders theyd totally understand. I cant stand their creepy crawly bodies!
I have a friend like that. We lose touch but we will always be great friends.
Thats awesome. Now I miss my friend. lol
Do you guys live far away from each other? I love talking with my mom about her and my childhood.
Aw thats awesome. I bet he enjoyed getting to know your past a little bit better.
Oh no.  Did he stand you up?
That stinks! Were you able to get the stain out?
Was the date at least good?
That sounds like good news and bad. I hope you will be going with him someday. 
Sometimes our best life experiences are after we make big changes in our life. It sounds like a fun adventure to me. 
Rain is relaxing to myself odd 
Thats annoying! The weather team has one job. Rain is so relaxing to be used for showering. 
Thats a wonderful situation to be in. Are you planning to tell her?
Thats understandable but you wont know her position on the issue until you bring it up. Either way its your call.
Oh really what movie?
I am so sorry.  Were you disappointed?
I love road trips sounds like a good time.
Hope you have a nice trip Its good to have things to look forward to. 
That sounds relaxing! What did you watch
Maybe Ill do that tonight!
Oh no! Im so sorry. What kind of dog was he?
Aww. Mine is getting pretty old. Im not looking forward to losing him.
You think you will get another one?
Oh boy I guess youll have your hands full.
I could understand that. I dont like crowds so lol.
Thats good. Abusive relationships are the worst.
Great! You deserve it!
Yuck. Did you throw the remote out?
They have a mind of their own some days.
Did you get all of it done?
Thats why I wear long shirts. You can work. and not offend anyone!
Mistakes are made but still. I can how that would be annoying.
I understand completely. I would have done the same.
Wow that must have been pretty challenging. Where you able to do it?
Oh man thats brutal. So close but so far.
That sounds awesome!  Did everything go well?
Thats not too bad Im glad you had a good vacay and your friend is trustworthy!
Did you adopt an animal
I feel all for those poor animals and want to adopt all of them
It would definitely be hard.  I feel bad for them being in cages.
i am sorry to hear that i know she will be better
before you know it  she will be out and about
I bet it was Im glad you are doing better now.  Did they find the person driving the van? Did they even stop?
Wow thats awesome you were only in for a few days.  I guess I havent had an accident that bad before but I would have thought it would have been a longer time period.  
Thats awesome I am really glad youre OK now 
Oh no!! Haha. The first days of school can be so hectic! But soon the routine will set in again and all will be good. 
Oh I can imagine! Glad everyone is ok!
I would of did the same.
It was a very devastating storm.
I hope so no one should have to live throught hat
How exciting! You must be so proud of him. What an accomplishment!
You definitely should be! Hopefully you took lots of photos!
Hahaha that is hilarious! We have some mega spiders where I live. Imagine pulling some toilet paper and a huge spider the size of your hand comes jumping out. It happened to me!!
Yeah they can help get the spider outside.
oh wow that is cool i dont think ill ever purchase a new car. a good used one will be my best option! 
I have and infinity!!! its an older 2006 model i got it at a insanely good price around 4k
I watched that happen. Been thinking about doing some research on trading with bitcoin.
Thats a good idea. I think there is alot of promise there. good luck.
Yikes! Id have jumped too.
We dont have any roaches where I live luckily.
That sounds awesome. Its important for kids to know self defense and also to be active so all boxes are checked.
I may have to encourage some of my family to pick up martial arts. We never delved to the high levels and I see a lot pf value in the teachings.
that sounds great you must be jazzed up about it
youll be great i wish i was there to see it
Oh that is terrible! Did you try to save the cat?
Ahhh what a horrible thing to see in the morning! Hope your day went well after that. 
Ive never heard of a hot water beach.  Whats it caused by?
Was that the coolest thing that you did there?
Who are we talking about? Im sorry youre upset. Maybe you could talk to her and let her know you need help.
Its okay. We all need to vent sometimes. Bosses are the worst people to deal with sometimes.
I bet it was! Did you end up finding it or did you have to cancel all of your cards?
Thats awesome!  I know stores will typically hold onto a lost wallet but calling you is going above and beyond what the norm is.
 i must have been terrifying I am glad you both made it through it
its nice to have another to lean on when it happened
That is awful!  I can deal with dogs barking during the day but at night is no good.
I really hope they listen and can make some changes!
That mustve been nice. I bet that reminded you a lot of when you were a kid. Did you enjoy your time with your mom?
Ha! Thats awesome. The 80s style was so cool! 
Thats really rough. Do you think he may have relapsed?
I would be too. Going through something like that can take a toll on anyone and makes it hard to cope with everyday life. I hope he gets the help he needs.
Thats awsome hopefully he sticks with it. Its a chick magbnet
Thats a great thing to have going for him!
Haha yeah cats can be rude! I prefer dogs myself. They are much sweeter.
Oh man! I feel for you!
Was it a koala?
I bet that was pretty awesome.  Howd you grow your eucalyptus?
Well I wish the best for both of you
Thats awesome! Did she have a good time doing the play?
I now the feeling I always had stage fright as a kid. Hopefully it wasnt too tough for her.
Aw you must be lonely. At least you have her pet with you right? What pet does she have?
Yeah cats are a little tricky. I think dogs are much more friendly but thats just me! 
Oh man that is terrifying. Im glad you didnt get hit. What kind of crazy person tries to turn and change lanes at the same time?
I know that feeling I see that kind of stuff all the time where I live too. I hope you stay safe.
Yes it is definitely difficult to change doctors.
I definitely understand.  My doctor is not super close either.
Yeah did something in particular make you feel that way?
Wow thats awesome! Good for you guys I hope you have many more happy years together. 
Aww Im sorry. Thats a tough one to go through. Mine had the same.
How old is she? I remember mine couldnt remember me me but I could still make her laugh
you will regret not going I think you should go
see you made the right choice and you will always be glad you went
Wow thats cool. What did you do?
Oh! Thats something to look forward to then! decide what your gonna do? 
Cool! thats what I always do on my birthday too! LOL
cool! are you going?
Keep Mturking brother
Nice!  Is that a perk of your job or did you have to use a vacation day?
Thats so awesome is it coming up or is that something they offered when you took the job?
Whats the movie? I love watching new stuff.
Id love to see that. I was a big fan of Winnie the Pooh growing up so I bet Ill love it.
Aw dang that must really be pain for you. Have you talked with anyone else about this? Im sure other people are having problems with this coworker also .
Ohhhhhhh yeah thats really hard on everyone then. Taking it to corporate would be a good idea to help the company and the workers if you need to vent out any more frustrations just let me know!
Oh yes! I really hate that. It has happened to me more than I like. Did you get a refund at least?
Did you get a refund at least?
Oh no that is so sad. I am sure it would of meant a lot for you to be there. 
I understand funerals can be heartbreaking. But it gives you good closure! 
Congratulations! That is always a great feeling! A reward after such hard work. 
This is very true and what all the great thinkers out there preach! 
It cant hurt to try might as well give it a shot right?
The worse they can do is not hire you gotta put yourself out there. best of luck!
Do you run into this issue a lot?  I could imagine grocery shopping to be a nightmare
Does online shopping make it easier?  I would think maybe it would relieve some stress if you could do it from your house
I do!  It grosses me out even when its my own.
I completely understand.  Hopefully the manager was able to take care of it for you!
Oh no! So I guess you had to stay that way til you got to go home?
Well Im glad you didnt hurt yourself at least.
Thats just disgusting!
Im glad you were there to show that people still care.
It happens to everyone being tired makes people so irritable. Being a mom is tough as it is.
Just give him a big hug and let him know how much you love him and Im sure all will be forgiven! 
I bet youve had to do a lot of prep work.  Do you feel ready?
What day do you leave for the trip?
Thats very inspiring. How has it changed your life?
Yes I think everything in life happens for a reason and we cant change that. Im glad you had your breakthrough!
What made you want to be a nurse?
Thats good its a lot of work sure you are ready for that?
Oh wow. Did you not want to go?
Lol. Aww. I hope he is back now. Mine no longer lives with me and I kind of like the quiet.
Did you have to get it pulled?
Do you feel better now that you got it done?
Thats awesome I havent been to a concert in ages. Who is the band?
I hope you have a great time! I should try and see a show soon so i can be cool like you.
Aww! You must feel lonely. Is he coming back soon?
Those must have brought back some great memories.
I havent watched any old videos in a very long time Ill have to see if I can find some next time Im at my parents.
I have heard the same thing from my friends who have kids!  They say its like a force takes over as soon as the baby is born
That has to be a very powerful feeling.
do you think they are up to something?
You should be careful about jumping to conclusions. 
Thats nice pretty rare to have good neighbors these days it seems!
You should have a beer with him or something to show your gratitude!
Uh oh. Is he better now?
OK good. What do you think caused the infection in the first place?
Is he a baby? I heard it happens often.
Aw thats so sweet!  Do you see a future together?
I really really hope it works out for you guys!
That had to be rough and glad to hear youre better. Do you have any followup appointments to go to?
Well at least you have some relief for now.  I hope that it stays in remission.
Hey good for you! That takes dedication. I admire that. 
Losing a few pounds has such a positive effect. You must feel better too. I need to get on that!
Thats really exciting for her!  But Im sure being apart will be difficult for both of you.
Hopefully she isnt too far away for you to visit often!
Man that really stinks.  Did insurance pay to repair your floor and cupboards?
When will your house be put back together?
Im so sorry to hear that.  Death is not an easy thing to cope with.
Its a difficult way to realize you should live every day to the fullest potential.
How exciting! first time there?
Whats it like? I have never been there. 
Sailor Moon!  That was the best show!  Ive shared it with my kids too.  And the laugh at the picture of me dressed up as Sailor Jupiter from loooooong ago!
My girls think Im the coolest because I watch Sailor Moon and Dragonball Super and a ton of other anime and Im like Ive been watching stuff like this since before you were born!
Thats good!  Ive got the ones that like watching anything about space.  The older one wants to be on a Mars mission!
Oh man. Did you end up falling?
Ouch.  Did you get bruised up?
Im sorry to hear that she passed away.  Had she been sick a long time?
Wow.  I hope she wasnt in any pain.
I think most people have been there.  Its tough disappointing your parents and even worse when you know you could have done something about it.
I got some bad grades in college and told my parents I was doing better than I was. I know how ashamed I felt at that time too.
How much money are we talking?
Fair enough. 100 can be made easily a watch with sentimental value is priceless.
Hopefully your hard work payed off. Where the finals hard?
I agree with you. Hard work tends to give the results in the end.
Oh lucky! That is one of my favourite places on earth!
Did you enjoy it once you got there?
It really is. Ive been to both disney world and dsiney land I think I prefer disney land. 
I know but it feels more....authentic or something!
Thats really bad what are you going to do?
Well at least you have a safety net. 
Thats got to be exciting!  And as a parent I salute you!  What grade do you teach?
Oh wow!  That does sound fun!  Just for the idea of eating in class every once in a while!
What sorts of things do the kids learn how to make?
I wish they had that when I was in school in 199coughcough  
That should be fun! Do you go every year?
very cool! Thats awesome you have that opportunity to do something you love every summer!
Yeah lawn mowing sucks!  Do you have a large lot?
Maybe that riding mower would be a worthy investment?
That sounds miserable. 
Why didnt you ask her to begin with?
Thats good!  Was there a reason for the suspension?
Itll be good for her to have your support so hopefully shell do better this semester.
Oh my god what happened?
Did it get on him?
Wow Im sorry about getting fired but it sounds like youve got guts! How do you like the business?
Oh that is so great. So many people fantasize about doing that.  Congratulations!
Oh cool! Have they arrived yet?
I love scary movies!  What was it about?
I love her!  Im definitely going to see it thanks for the rec!
Yeah I hate when people do that. It can ruin things.
Friends come and go in life its up to you to determine if you want to reconcile with this person or not.
Oh my. You are brave.  Thank goodness they didnt break.  Did you mom  know what happened?
Thats good. My mom would freak
Sounds amazing! What kind of art does she want to produce?
Wow. Sculpture. Very impressed. 
Is it that time where you live? How do you prepare?
Wow. that must make you nervous. Where do you live?
What is the secret? 
Thats something she should know. 
Thats awesome were they for school or for fun?
Thats awesome! Theyll come in handy on those rainy days or nice relaxing days!
your are torn between him being a man but you still think of him being your little boy
you will enjoy it as he grows older because you had a hand in it and know that he will be prepared for it
OMG that sounds awful!  Was your friend upset?
Nah if they were understanding its all good!  Everyone has a little too much from time to time.
He must have saved up quite a bit for that. Theyre pretty expensive
Being frugal is always a benefit in the long run. I suggest doing online surveys to make some extra cash  
Thats great!  How many dogs do you have?
Awwww!  That sounds so fun!  And they sound like such happy little guys!
Nope  school started for the kids today!
This is the earliest theyve ever started here.
Oh that sounds amazing! were you a little jealous? Did they have fun?
I completely understand. It does sound amazing though!
I know what you mean. We are only lucky enough to travel local.
Oh no! I am so sorry. That is really tough.  
Did you get any feedback on what you could do to improve your chances next time?
Ah that happens.  Again very sorry. Maybe you can find the silver lining in it. Or find a new job and get a fresh start somewhere else. 
Wow! Thats a good deal I wish I knew how to find that!
Aww thats disappointing. Sorry to hear that. 
Aw I am so sorry to hear of your dogs passing. Its hard to lose a pet. We just lost our cat this year.
It will get easier. Hang in there!
It does. I just got a new kitten a few weeks ago. It helps to have her to cuddle with.
Congratulations. Is it for something that youre keen on pursuing a little longer term?
Oh Im sorry to hear that. Still onwards and upwards. I wish you all the best!
That sounds sweet.
Why didnt you?
They usually use their smartphones while driving which is very bad for everyobys safety
Yes we as a community must teach people how to drive properly without any risks
Congratulations!  Thats awesome.  Sometimes its scary to risk rejection but it sounds like it totally paid off in this case.  
Im about to switch careers so Ill be doing the interviewing thing soon. Its scary.  
Why do you feel that way?
You sound a bit like me. I get lost in the details of things myself sometimes. Im sure after you weigh the pros and cons of the situation youll come to the right conclusion for yourself.
Aw really? Was it a long time ago or did you graduate recently?
I graduated a long time ago too  1985. Those were great times for me too. I feel sentimental about it.
Thats so great! I hope you get the job  assuming its one you really want.
Then keep your head up  keep reaching for the stars! Maybe this will be the one!! But even if it doesnt turn out keep on searching. Your perfect job IS waiting for you. 
Youre welcome  best wishes with your job hunting!
Mine went back to school today!  I watched the bus drive off and I kinda looked around and said to myself Well shoot what now?
Mine are older and think theyre too cool for everything.  I took my usual first day of school picture and I got Mom arent we too old for this?
When theyre little thats the best age for pictures  theyll never meet a camera that they dont like.
The same!  17 15 girls and 10 boy
Thats so fun! Ive always wanted to get into baking. How did the cake turn out?
I bet you were so proud of your creation! I hope everyone enjoyed the cake.
Im sorry. I bet you miss her a lot?
That must be really tough. I hope you can see her again soon.
Wow!  Where did you find those?  I remember watching that series as a kid!
Its so good to see old shows we grew up on coming out on DVD!  
You mustve been really disappointed in him. Did you talk to him and find out why he did it?
He better be! Sounds like hes in the wrong crowd. Hopefully he finds new friends soon.
Youre lucky to have her! Its hard to find someone to trust. 
Aw Im sure you tell her. I hope to be that kind of mom when my kids are adults. 
Aww Im sure thats been nothing but positive for you. 
Moms. They are the best. 
Sounds like a great friend to have. Do you guys still keep in touch?
It happens to everyone honestly I can relate. We will always have good memories to remember though and thats what matters the most.
Sounds fun! How close are you to your target?
That should help with the cost then. How much money do you need to save?
Those are the most fun sorts of essays to write  and the easiest.  How do you think you did?
Wow!  Sounded like a real breeze!  What did you write about?
That is very kind of you.  Im sure the owner was very appreciative!
If I lost mine hiking I would for sure think it was gone forever.  Hopefully they didnt cancel too many cards before you got it back to them!
These things take time.  Have you met any of your neighbors?
Maybe you should try introducing yourself to your neighbors.  Or look online for meetups for hobbies that youre interested in.
Ah. that sucks. Long commutes are miserable! hopefully you do better at the course this time.
Yea those out of state fees can be ridiculous. Best of luck to you!
Thats really nice of you.  Do you feed them too?
Awww have you adopted any that you brought in?
Thats great!  How do you think it went?
With that kind of confidence you should be a shoein for the promotion!
Aw thats wonderful! What kind of dog?
Oh nice they can be so sweet and gentle. 
Lucky you! I wanna go there to.
It probably is at least you get to experience another culture.
not really I kill everything
are they carrot flowers? 
really did you tell them your secrets?
how did it make you feel to disclose that information?
Yes everyone does. that was really brave of you!
i see you are a PS4 fan
i dont have a PS4 alot of people play fortnite. is that a cool game?
Oh yeah many times. Not a whole lot of fun.
Wow. I hope you didnt hurt yourself!
Thats exciting!  Are you hitting up one of the amusement parks?
I have always wanted to go to that.  I love Universal and Halloween is my favorite holiday
Were either of the dogs hurt?
Your neighbor is very careless. Thankfully no one got hurt
really what is the secret? 
wow that is some secret. 
lol right! she would defintely make world star. 
oh nice! first one?
I bet. Do you have any children of your own?
so that means extra spoilage P
by spoil do you mean mountain dew?
Thats awesome! I was actually looking for mine the other day.  Were you looking up anyone in particular or just for fun?
I still see my high school buddies on a somewhat regular basis but it is a great time telling those stories over and over.
Ooh sounds nice Always good to see the siblings.
Hah i hope you two have some fun. My sisters visited me a few weeks ago and we had some fun.
I didnt even realize they let you adopt dogs that failed the training how did it fail do you know?
Wow I bet it will be a really good dog then. Hopefully you hear something soon!
Uhoh thats not good!  Did they understand?
Yeah you got lucky there for sure!
Nice!  Was he surprised or hoping to do better
Thats great!  Which belt has he earned?
Oh man that sucks 😢
Its okay there will be other times
That must have felt very good. And taken a lot of determination.
Its great to have friends in the classroom. Are you still friends with some of them?
Thats good. Sometimes classmates can make all the difference I agree.
Thats terrible!  Are you repairing it yourself?
Can they be fixed or do you have to get different cabinets?
No way! Thats awesome!! How old is your son?
I bet! Thats great news though congrats to him!
Did you finally manage to find a house you like?
I remember how frustrating house hunting was.  Glad it has worked out for you.
Oh yeah school year starts soon. Well I hope youll have an easy year!
Thats beautiful looks like youve found a job thats fulfilling!
That happens you have to acknowledge mistakes to learn from them.
Oh well that seems improper you should bring it up to her supervisor.
I hear that.  I cant afford all of them but I have several.  Nintendo forever!
I havent got that one yet but once I have a bit of spare cash Ill look into it.  
Oh no. You must feel apprehensive. You forgive yourself?
Good. We all make mistakes. Its the human condition. 
Thats really nice. Did it make you recall any memories you had forgotten about?
Im glad you have something to remind you of them!
Thats so stressful.
Yes it does. The DMV has the longest wait times. You go in first thing and already have a 45 minute wait from the get go. 
Sometimes it can be hard to be patient I can totally relate to that. Not sleeping well can make you really irritable sometimes.
I hear ya Dont be too hard on yourself though. being a parent can really test you! Im sure you are doing fine.
are you excited to get back to work?
Im sure the students are nervous about meeting their new teacher as well.
That must be very challenging to deal with at times.
I can understand being emabarrassed by that as well.
You must be excited! Are you a huge fan?
Sounds interesting. I do a bit. Not an avid fan though.
Well that must have been nice!  I assume you wanted it and not something different?
No that sounds great I dont go to the same places enough for that maybe Ill get lucky someday!
i hate when coworkers fight it is so uncomfortable and you dont want to take sides
i do not know what to say i guess the best thing to do is let them work it out on their own
I love to look at photos
What is your favorite memory of your birthday?
Sounds like a lot of fun.
I like to go out for dinner.
Thats not something that should be done in a meeting. If theyre going to argue it should be done in private.
Do you know if they managed to work things out?
Oh no!  How terrible.  I hope no one was hurt.
That is horrible.  I cant even imagine.
No im 20 years old. Dont plan on having kids for another couple years!
Whats troubling about them?
Oh my goodnes that must have been a lot of fun! How long did it take?
I bet. I used to have a dog years ago and have had that happen too.
Really? Did you get up to see what made the sound?
Yeah that noise would have scared me and I would have grabbed a weapon to. 
What did you decide on?
That is a good thing to do im sure you feel empowered because of that
Funny how that happens isnt it? Any memories in particular stand out?
Thats great that shes kept so many! I bet your family will appreciate that as time goes on.
What class do you teach?
How interesting. I bet you are super proud.
Im sorry to hear that do you have insurance to help you?
Yeah well im glad you atleast have that to help you
Thats awesome! You are fortunate to have a mom like that
Do you live with your mom still?
Thats not good Did he do something to you?
Im sorry but you should still never hit him. It could just make him bit again
Im sorry to hear that. Did you ask them why?
How did you hear about what happened?
Im sorry to hear that how old was the pet?
Yeah that is pretty old for a animal but that is life i guess
Sorry to hear you had a wreck but thankful you had insurance
I think its wonderful you will not have any expenses from the wreck
That is awesome we need more people like that in the world
Yeah you are a very lucky person
What do you think you can do about it?
Busted thats good stealing is a horrible thing to deal with.
Im sorry that happened. Did it atleast smell good?
Oops. What did you bet about?
I like to bet in the football pools at the bar I visit. I lose a lot though.
Im sorry to hear that. did you hurt yourself?
Yeah i can only imagaine
You know I love cats but do you think it needs a mental evaluation or was it upset you were gone so long?
Well it sounds like it was your fault then I would attack you to if you left me at home all day with food! lol
I dont think I would do that. seems a little odd to me
Still that seems a little strange to do
Congratulations I know you must be very proud
Thats important these days more than ever.
no is it fun?
that is really cheap!
Was it your birthday?
What did she buy ya?
Can you see it from your backyward?
Im sorry to hear that. I dont like my neighbors either
Oh. Was it because she didnt trust you or you didnt trust her?
Well that is good. Not too many people trust their spouses nowadays. 
That is great How far is he away from yoyu
Yeah that is pretty far
I love Vegas what did you like the best?
I would too. I like the light shows and magic shows
Have you found anything promising?
Well keep looking something is out there for you
It smelled bad and you felt bad LOL
Yeah but where i live snow and ice are not really a issue
Oh no! I am so sorry to hear that. I hope you are feeling better. 
Thats good. And your girlfriend sounds like a real keeper. 
Well maybe you should move closer to them?
Yeah the cold can affect us older gents in some odd ways.
Moms like to do that they worry about their kids!
You should talk to her every chance you can you never know when it will be your last. 
That sounds like sooo much fun! I want to get a hot tub someday. 
That is good. Its not good to be stressed. 
Im sorry but you should still try to remain positive about it
I know You just have to take it one day at a time
That is very odd I wouldnt give them any of that information. He is up to no good!
Good call! I would of done the same thing. You can never be too careful! 
Man I love when you can enjoy some good food from your childhood. It brings back so many memories. 
For sure I miss being able to have my moms cooking. Now I am very far away from her.
That is frustrating! Most people dont know basic trouble shooting skills. 
Yeah it can be hard to be patient with people like that. 
I would be mad too you should demand him to buy you more!
Yeah make him regret doing such a cruel thing. 
Yes it has been a very wild and wet summer.
I bet. This has been the most rainy season I have ever seen
Darn! Why did you have to cancel? 
oh my goodness! That is scary! I am glad to hear you are ok.
Oh no that is so unfortunate and so unthoughtful of the other driver! 
Yeah it shouldnt affect your insurance. Since you were not at fault. But who knows how the whole thing will turn out. 
That would be I hope your insurance takes care of you!
That is good it is nice to be proud of the work you have done!
Now you can relax and enjoy the rest of your day.
Its nice when family has your back.
Thats always important anytime your in a dangerous siyuation.
Oh thats nerve wracking the waiting especially when you know you are good for the job.
Well this is how you get some but having to deal with situations where your only choice is to wait patiently!
Oh wow was it scary in there?
I cant stand the haunted houses where things jump out at you
That is really nice of her I wish I had a neighbor that was that nice!
I need to actually build a relationship with my neighbors. I barely even know mine. 
Congratulations! Is this your first ever promotion?
Cool! What industry do you work in?
I bet. I hate when a few people mess up a good thing.
Im sorry that happened.
Awesome! What brand is it? 
Neat! Did you buy it used or new? Its always a satisfying experience!
No they are not in my area anymore. 
Thats a shame they were one of the first stores I remember.
Thats horrible!  Was the kitten okay?
Did you report the person to the police?
Oh were you lonely? You must have missed him. Was he gone long?
My husband used to travel on his job a lot. It was hard at first but I got used to it after some time. Maybe you can get your girlfriend to come over?
Was she mad at you?
Was she alone?
Oh no is there any ways to stream it online?
That wont be fun waiting. But at least you can skip the commercials. 
You are very lucky. I wish I was with my family.
You are right. I always feel nostalgic looking at my grandmas old photograph
Oh no sorry to hear that  were you able to retake it?
I can only imagine. Its one of those things that would embarass anyone but it happens to us all at some time
Wow it must be really nice to have your family close by.
No my family is quite small. Is yours large?
Oh no! Did he make a big mess?
Did you have to teach him a lesson?
Neat! I invest a lot too! I have Century Link and it was up slightly today. Did any of your others go up?
Oh gotcha! Well at least it wasnt as bad as the crash of 2008.
Ohh cool! I am chiefs fan. I dont remember that match. Who won?
Ohh you have a really good memory. I am very bad at remembering things lol.
Congrats to your sondaughter! They grow up so fast
No I dont. But I want to have kids someday.
Oh? Do you know what theyre bringing out next or will it be a surprise?
Why is that? Too soggy?
Please tell me you went through with it.  That sounds like it would have been an experience!
Theyve should have had similar feelings so they should have been more understanding.
Ohh i am sorry. How is he feeling now?
ohh thats so bad. It was not even your brothers fault. I really feel sorry for him.
Condolences it is very sad to lose a grandparent they are so special to us
Oh that brings back memories my grandparents raised me. I am so sorry

Thats sad to hear. i hope he pulls through.
Ohh good for you! You are very lucky
I wish I had such a good co workers!
Wow. You must be proud of him. Congratulations

Yeah? what did you do? Do tell!
Price we pay for beauty...I bet you looked amazing!
Wow that must have been a treat for you to finally be able to get some alone time all o yourself! That was also very kind of you husband to do.
That is awesome I know how challenging it can be to get some alone the especially when you have kids and there is no school in the summer!
That is great to hear! What is the achievement that you consider to be your best? 
Oh wow! Congratulations thats amazing! Is your husband also a dancer?
That is super romantic! Thats cool that you guys have a shared passion for dance.
Oh no! Why do you feel embarrassed?
Was the man nice about it at least?
Thats great!  Have you ever met?
You found nice memories. Yes. I finished high School 14 yrs ago. What about you?
Awww that is cute. Is she married already? or are u married with someone else?

Well thats great. I hope that you show a lot of passion in your style maybe with bright colors.
Im sorry to hear that he passed away but Im glad that you have good memories of him.
That is heartwarming. You are lucky to have had such a loving grandpa!
That is great! Are you not looking forward to it as much anymore? 
That is great I bet you had a great time because it is always nice to be able to escape  for a week and just relax!  
Good luck! What will you use the money for if you win?
Thats awesome. You could probably get a scholarship and go back to school for free though
Oh no why do you think that? 
Aww I hope that you two were able to discuss about what happened and how it made you feel. He may have not realized that he was doing that because there may have just been too many people there.
Oh no. What?
Eeewwww!! I have never seen that in real life but just the thought is super disgusting!!
Me too! Do you see them in your home often?
Are they not afraid of spiders?
Why is that? I Too have had some not so good feelings lately 
Oh dang Did she eventually find a ride?
Hopefully she doesnt blame you. Does she?
Oh no would you like to talk about it? I really hope that you are alright. 
Oh no I am so sorry to hear that. I wish you all the best and they are probably in a better place  
Dang i can relate. Have you researched other wifi providers?
I understand that. its crazy how our tax money paid for them to improve that and they never did.
What you did is good. They need a lot of help. Not only money but also emotional
it is good idea. You will be happy helping others. 
Onc or twice but i try not too often
You are very trausting. What happened?
What did you do was it embarrassing?
Goodness that must have been terrible you shouldnt be so trusting of others.
Good job studying. how did you do?
Congratulations! Tests are always hard it feels great when you do well.
Oh wow! Congratulations to him!!
It sounds like it! What kind of a job is it?
Oh man thats rough. Maybe after he works there for a bit he can put in a good word for you.
Awww.   What secret is this?
I will always be here for you. Secrets are for sharing with someone you trust.
You are such a good and patient personyou must really love him
I am such a lucky guy to have a friend like you
That must have been exciting. Was your friend much changed?
It is always good to see old friends after years of separation. It makes us nostalgic.
Flirting is fun. women enjoy it a little more than men do I believe.
Good. MThat can be devastating.
Thats so sweet. What kind of dog do you have?
Thats a relief. Is he usually difficult to walk?
Oh my God! Are you ok?
Good! Life is unpredicatable and on the road its not how you drive its how other drive.
Oh my goodness. Are you okay?
Im glad youre safe and the car can be repaired. Let the insurance companies deal with it.
Sounds like a good firl. how old is she?
Girls can be tough at that age. You are lucky 
Congratulations on your graduation! You must be so proud.
Its nice to have supportive people around you. It really builds up your confidence.
Nah most kids that age are just trying to buy candy. its much worse when you know fullly what stealing implicates.
You should dont worry about it 0
Gosh. You must be anxious. How are you coping?
Can I do anything to help? Maybe bring a few beers over and we can watch the game?
I know exactly what you mean. Achievement and productivity then rest and relaxation provide a certain level of contentment.
Glad I could relate my friend. Enjoy the rest of your day.
That is so great to hear. I hope to be able to say the same one day.
I am hopeful that I will achieve that. Hopefully soon.
Well it will get better. Life happens all the time. We have to just accept it and move on.
We all have embarrassing moment. We just have to just laugh and keep on.
Why dont you two play chess together anymore?
Im sorry to hear that. I can only imagine how precious those chess matches were to you. I bet you look back on them fondly.
Wow that sounds like fun! It does take a lot of planning but it is so worth it.
I am so jealous! I hope you pack lots of sunscreen.
Thats very sweet. My daughters do that too.
Yes it is. They can be very helpful when they want to be.
Oh dear! You must be anxious for your colleague. I really hope everything comes out alright.
You are a good and caring friend. She is lucky to have you.
I totally get that. My sister does the same thing. Its hard not to feel envious even if you have a good life.
I have friends like that too. To be honest I have dropped friendships over this. 
So i safely reached home.
I know what you mean. In time you will be able to ride again.
Have you thought about getting therapy?  Sometimes it will speed the process of healing.
Yeah it will not hurt. Can you go for walks instead?
That sounds like fun. Sometimes its good to get away without the kids. Im sure they are having  a blast at grandmas house.
I hope you guys have a good time and are able to reconnect with each other in new ways.
Thats awesome! Its great to work hard especially when you people show they actually appreciate what you do. 
Exactly. I feel like thats one of the best feelings. 
Thats so sad. did you apologize to her?
Forgetting is part of human nature. Im sure shell forgive you eventually.
I am afraid of water too. I somewhat know how you are feeling.
I would be afraid of alligator. The water has so much pollution in it. But then again we cant worry about things.
Thats awesome. I bet she is so excited.
I can see where you would be shocked. Im happy for her. 
What wasnt a good experience?
Tell me more what happened with your friend?
 i can imagine how they felt
i hope they didnt get mad at you some  things like are so precious 
Congratulations! When is she due? 
I hope everything works out well for you! That is so exciting.
Wow. Your husband sound like such a sweet guy.
Youre a lucky lady. He must be a really caring man.
You should ask them if you can tag along! Im sure they wont mind one bit.
Will it cost a lot to go on a tour with them?
I think I have a problem with jealousy because its starting all over again. What sort of dog do you have?
Youre so lucky. Im sure youve earned that sense of personal enrichment. You deserve it.
Oh that sounds like a blast! Did you go?
Oh dear. This sounds like a bad comedy movie. What did you do then?
Ugh thats really rough!  You shouldnt feel foolish though it could happen to anyone.
I hope you feel better soon!
Did anyone else see what happened?
Dogs can get crazy like that sometimes Im glad no one else saw it happen!
Congratulations!  Do you want to marry her though?  Dont jump into a marriage because its what people expect. If youre happy as you are just be happy!
Then go for it!!  Go buy that engagement ring and set up a beautiful proposal.
Wow you must have trained hard for that.
I do marathons too. Netflix. haha
I love dogs!  Did you find one?
Oh man!  You must have your hands full!  I bet youre having a ton of fun though
Thats great news! Im so happy for you. Ive been with my wife for 15 years.
No we had to fight through a lot of stuff. Just love each other and always remember your not each others enemy.
Oh no! I am so sorry to hear that.  Want to talk about what happened?
Did they have major layoffs or something?  
Ah the love is a cowboys fan?
I mostly watch college but yeah football is great!
I can totally imagine. Did you do anything to stop them from coming up?
Thats a bummer! Ive always found drinking a bit of water and then holding my breath helps a bit.
I agree. I think it is important for couples to be secure enought to be happy that way.
I have been reading a lot it really helps me relax so much.
Congratulations. Did you get a raise too?
ahh I know that feeling.  Did you have a stressful day?
Ill keep my fingers crossed for you!
Is your spouse jealous? Why did you feel you couldnt go?
Its a party with lots of people not a private dinner. I respect and understand your devotion to your husband though.
I am so sorry to hear about that. It is very hard to lose a loved one but treasure the memories of that person especially the good memories. 
Oh dear I can only imagine please stop blaming yourself. I feel your pain.
I stay home on black Friday. Too many people for me.
Im sure you will have fun.
It is such a wonderful thing to have a mom who one can depend on.
I wish my mom was still alive. Just make sure that you show her how much you appreciate her. Even though you were upset because you had to work look at the bright side.
Oh yes mothers make our lives much better and gives us a new meaning in life.
And also be thankful that you have a job
Were you hurt?
Wow! Did you have to go to the doctor?
Was anything broken?
Im sorry to hear about that.
Did this cause trouble for you at work?
Its good that you dont let others bring you down.
Just remember things happen for a reason. When one door closes another one opens.
Just stay positive and always be thankful.
Its good that youre confident. What subject do your exams cover?
Oh sounds difficult. Good luck.
If it is a treasured gift your friend should not be asking for it! how did you feel when she did ask you? 
Did she understand when you gave her the reason you didnt want to lend it to her? 
She doesnt sound like a good friend to me! 
That can be very stressful. I hope you did well.
I might try listening to some calming music. Stress can have a negative impact on your health.
Who is Janie?
Aww thats great dogs can be so loving.
That must be really hard to deal with.   have you tried an aluminum free deodorant?  It helps me 
I am sorry you have to deal with that.   I am lucky because I dont sweat that much.  Cant imagine having to deal with that.  I hope you find something that can help you
I just moved to a small town and we dont have a Dairy Queen here. I used to go to one where I lived before.
It was always clean with quick service. The workers were always very friendly also. I miss that about my hometown people are much more quiet and keep to themselves here. Are you originally from there?
Have you ever thought about moving to a different citystate? Do you think you would be happy someplace new?
I think i would like to move eventually but for now im barely learning how to be independent i started abusing drugs at age 14 now 15 years later im barely starting to grow up almost a year sober now. hopefully within the next few years I can experience that!
I really do like it here my city isnt quite urban but its not rural either Harlingen TX cost of living is pretty low here and i think the weather is always nice.
What is your favorite Christmas memory?
That sounds like a pleasant time.
That is so incredible!!! Does he make a lot of money doing it?
Thats so awesome.  How old is he now?
That is great. Not too many children are grateful of their parents. 
Thats great! They sound like they are very good parents. 
Wow!! That is amazing! Good for him. You must be really proud and you have every right to be!  
I bet he is!  
I can relate feeling lonely isnt a good thing. How are you coping with it? 
Losing the companionship of a friend really changes your routine. In sure youll find another friend and you wont be lonely.
Wow yeah I can relate. Being really high up is terrifying but at least on a roller coaster it is only for a really short and fast period of time! 
Haha yeah that is great! I am glad you enjoyed the thrill of riding one 
I am great! HOw are you doing today?
Oh that is so great.  Is this her first?
Im sorry for your loss.
She sounds really wonderful. 
That is extremely sad. That must have been difficult.
How old were you at the time?
What a strange place for introspection! What did you learn?
Wow thats pretty fundamental to your personality and a great thing to discover. I imagine the knowledge will help you throughout life.
Wow testing that is hard. Glad you enjoyed it.
A U grade? yeah thats one that needs explaining
Very cool was it for a high school reunion?  Hopefully it brought up good memories!
Awesome!  Hopefully you gave them the motivation they needed for the new year!
oh no! what are you going to do?
Oh man. Good luck!
I hate it when that happens. I dont feel like it is necessary to flakethey should be sure before they lead people along.
Thats completely reasonable considering the distance you had to drive for no reason. hopefully another interested buyer pops up soon.
Aww what a bummer! I am sorry to hear that there are plenty of more jobs out there though keep trying!
That does make such a difference a job that you enjoy
Thats great! Where did you get it from?
Is there somewhere special that you are going to wear it?
That should be fun!
That sounds awesome.  Did you guys do anything with the day off or just hang out watching TV?
Strawberries in cinnamon roles?  That might be really good!
What kind of a car is it?
That sounds great! What color is it?
Oh I am so sorry to hear that. That is terrible. 
Me too. That was very nice of what you did for that dog. 
Thats great. How did she do by the end of the day?
Oh Thats hard work School and a job. It shows good work ethic though.
oh was he trying to be funny or was he just creepy?
wow that is somewhat disturbing! I cant understand how people get such serious emotions for famous people.
Oh wow!  Are you happy about the purchase?
I would be too! What kind?
I have seen things I cant explain. I didnt stick around to ask I ran. But afterwards I was thinking it was a ghost. 
Thats scary. Im not sure what I would have done if that were me. What did you do? 
Wow thats scary. And I would have probably done the same thing. 
Oh Im so sorry. How old was she?
Yes Its nice that her struggle is over and she is in a wonderful place now.
Do you still draw? I was never talented in drawing.
Oh i bet! Why did you stop drawing?
wow i do not know either to say way to go or you better not
thats good to hear and if your spouse finds out she would be proud and mad at the friend
Awesome! What happened?
I love days like that with two gets that would be the best day for me as well!
Thats great! Was it Kindergarten or PreSchool?
Thats great! Did you cry when you took him?
Thats true. When my kids went to school the first day I just kept standing around until one of the teachers finally told me I could go...
Its good that your standing up for your marriage like that. A lot of people arent that committed.
You are a wonderful person then.
Did it make you feel frightened?
Thats a shame but sometimes it is good to face our fears.
Oh no! Why do long? Did you walk?
That stinks but I am sure you got to see a lot of nice scenery. 
Maybe he will understand but just in case Id make him a new one.
Dont feel bad It happens to the best of us.
Oh wow. I hate it when people do things like that. They should just be honest and upfront to begin with instead of causing drama.
Im sorry it fell through but hopefully you will find something even better and bonus you wont have to deal with her.
Yea I hate the wait for aid and all the paperwork. Hopefully it is resolved soon so you can ride comfortably.
Hopefully the car holds up. I think you are playing it smart by having realistic expectation of when aid will arrive.
Cool. What kind of instrument were they playing?
Maybe a ukulele? Its always fun to hear new music you like!
Thats wonderful! It sounds like you really care about each patient. 
I bet! I bet that job would be a lot on your physically as well as mentally.
Sometimes things come up. Its hard to travel during the holidays. Especially if your friend has kids.
Maybe this year will be different.
Dogs are really the best arent they? They are the greatest friends we can ask for.
He sounds wonderful and he sounds like he was a great companion and friend. 
maybe you had a good reason to do this
i think he will fully understand and see it as no problem
Haha did someone else eat the pizza?  Was that someone you?
hahaha he may have been a little angry but Im sure he got a decent laugh out of it.
Oh no! Thats terrible! Were you okay?
Im so glad you were okay!
Why didnt you walk away lol
You should of try to let it out slowly.
Oh thats terrible. What did you tell him?
Well thats good advice. I hope it worked out for him!
Oh no. Was it something that was in the family or was it something that you purchased. Either way Im sorry to hear that. 
Im sorry to heat that. Thats something that cant be replaced. 
Thats very sad Im sorry. I have had family members pass as well and it is never easy. 
That poor woman. Hopefully she is going to be all right. 
Really! Did you have fun? 
Oh no! That sounds scary. Some of the rollercoasters can be very well built while others are very sketchy
Cool is there a particular country that youre visiting?
Were you nervous at all about the vaccines? Needles make me queasy. Ive fainted a couple times giving blood and receiving vaccines.
Ive never heard of it  whats it about?
So cute! I can relate to that on a fundamental level.
That sounds great! Did you have a good visit? I hope it wasnt awkward. 
Very cool. My own father passed away a few years ago. I miss doing things with him. 
Thanks. I just wish we had taken more time to spend together in his final years. 
Thats awesome when that kind of thing happens. Are you guys together now?
Aww man. Well be thankful it happened sooner than later.
My brother just went thru the same thing recenly. He is so much happier without this girl he was dating. she was alot!
I think he has already. lol
Did you? Was it good?
Thats great. I may have to try it out.
Thats a great achievement! What book did you decide to read?
Neat! I am trying to find so good books to start reading.
Oh no! That stinks!
Haha! Its good you could see the big picture in a stressful situation.
Well that was nice.  Do you normally walk?
Have you stayed in contact with the person that gave you a lift?
I could have took the day offbut I went in anyway.
Yes it was
I agree cheating isnt rewarding. 
I agree with that one hundred percent. 
Time flies. Does this make you feel sad?
Its nice to reflect on the accomplishments of out loved ones.
Wow! Thats amazing! You must be proud! What is your secret?
You are so inspiring! Good for you!!
Whoa thats pretty darn late! Did you ask her why she was out so long?
Well thats frustrating. Hopefully next time shell think more about how her actions affect you.
Well Happy early Birthday!  I hope you enjoy it when it comes. 
A special cake sounds wonderful and youre welcome. 
Me too! Do you have a favorite team?
Yes thats my favorite team too! Yay!
I know how that feels and anyone who doesnt consider the safety of others isnt that great of a person.
Speak up next time!
Oh thats scary. Ive been there. Just give it some time to feel right. Home is where ever you want it to be.
Thanks its so true. Ive moved around alot.
Yep! Dad was in the army.
Wow that must have been very shocking. At least you can keep it to remember her by.
my goodness i feel terrible
wow i hope it all works out soon
What? You think you might be in trouble?
Why in the world did you do that? I hope they never find out...
Ducks are really cute especially babies.
Thats very nice of you. The only downside I can think of is them doing a lot of pooping.
That sounds lovely!
What a wonderful time for you and your friend! 
Thats cool what was the deal for?
Wow that does sound like a pretty good deal. Makes you wonder why its so cheap.
Neat! What typeof music is the concert for?
Interesting! Ive never hear their music before!
Did you visit one recently?
That is awesome! I am so proud of your son you should be proud as well.
I can just imagine how you feel. It is so nice when our kids make us proud.
That was nice of you. Is she feeling better now?
I am glad to hear that. Its so sweet that you were able to help her.
I have a feeling you got it. 
Oh no I hope youre okay!
Thats great! I hope things keep looking up for you!
Oh that is so sad. What kind of dog was he. How long did he live for?
Sounds like you had lots of great times together. You will have to remember those while you grieve. 
I can imagine that would be very painful. Are you doing better now?
Im glad to here that Im sure that moving forward after something as difficult as that is very emotionally difficult.
Did you get in much trouble? I was allowed to kind of run wild so never had any issues with staying out till sunrise. 
Its sweet that she was waiting up for you. 
Wow it sounds like a great time with him!
Haha! That does sound like an amazing car!
Oh wow Im glad you have gotten your self prepared for a big blow. I hope you stay safe.
Went through Irma last year. We sat it out too.
Where they able to cover for the other employee?
Thats good I know what its like when you cant get a shift covered and your just understaffed and scrambling the whole day.
Congrats to your family! What an honor that is. May I ask the name?
Absolutely. Thats nice you two are close
Oh you must be so excited! I have a son in the Army as well and I love when he gets to visit! 
Yes I am. Its so nice to see our sons sacrifice for our country. But I think they do it more because they think they are protecting us. 
Oh no! Did she damage your car?
I can understand that. I would be extra careful if I was driving someone elses car...especially Benz!
my goodness so terrible
oh i bet i would have been too
Oh no. Im sorry you feel lost!
Awww poor thing! I hope you find him!
No just go ahead and keep going.  It will be fine.
If they would have had you on camera they would have already come after you for it.  I wouldnt worry about it.
Yeah.  Youre smooth.  You can do it no problem.
So... was it cold?
Im so glad your dad was there to help you. Did he catch you?
Thats awesome! Dads are the best!!
How  deep was the pool?
Oh no! Have you looked up the user manual or taken it to a repairman to get it fixed
That takes some real hard work to fix something like that. I am sure it came in handy for cleaning up that stain.
That is true being able to fix your own stuff is a valuable skill to have. 
Well thats understandable. How did it go?
It sounds like it turned out really great for you. Way to go!
Oh I love caramel apples! Theyre one of my favorite treats in the fall. Did you guys make your own caramel?
Sounds just like my family. Caramel is so hard to get right on the first try!
yes. both good and bad. What happened?
Wow thats so sweet!!! I love that they didnt forget about you!
Who did  tell me more
well thats not nice I hope she stars treating you better
wow that must have been a surprise and a joy for you
i can imagine it. no matter how old and grown your son gets he will always be your little boy
Nothing like fresh veggies! What did you plant?
Mmmm...you are making my mouth water. Juicy fresh tomatoes are the best!
Oh no! That must have been so scary!
Ill bet you were. Im so glad you had a happy ending!
Hi friend! I am not sure who you are talking about. Who blew you away?
Oh that is very nice! I guess he doesnt do that often if you were blown away. Seems like he loves you very much. 
that is so nice that he trust you with such a keepsake
im sure sure was. was it a special occasion when he gave you the ring?
Oh that sounds so exciting! What did you make?
Oh sounds yummy! I love seafood. 
Oh no!  How did that happen?
Thats horrible.  I hope you and your family made it out okay!
That sounds like a lot of fun! Did you discover anything new?
Thats pretty exciting! I hope it sparks a lot of new conversations for you both.
Oh no!! That is terrible! Are you ok? Will your insurance cover it?
That is a scary situation! Glad that you are alright! Man you car though! What a nice car it is such a shame.
Oh no!  Did he give you a reason why?
Thats terrible.  Have you said something to HR about this?
Im so sorry to hear that Are you handling it ok?
I miss my father just the same I suggest going and doing something you both enjoyed doing together. I find I feel closer to them in those moments almost like we are still sharing them together.
Itd nice you have a memento like that to remember him by. Did he wear it often?
What a great thing to have I glad youre able to keep his memory alive like that. 
Thats so nice! He sounds like a keeper!
Im glad you guys found each other. He sounds like a nice guy.
Oh I hate it when that happens. Makes you feel disorganized in your thoughts even.
Take a day and devote it just for the house. Thats what I do. I always feel so much better the next day thats not on my back.
Oh sorry to hear that man. Yeah girls are hard to trust these days. Whats up with that?
You did? Wow! What did it reveal?
Wow! Good riddens to her! Haha
That is terrible! I hope no one got hurt. 
Thats good. Hopefully your car got fixed as well. 
Im sorry that is tough. What breed was it?
Aw! Life ends sadly. Have you thought about getting another cat?
I love doughnuts. Did they have them?
I envy you wish I was there to have some with a cup of coffee
Oh yes my favorite. I hope you shared with others.
Awesome! I imagined he enjoyed it.
Oh no! Did you end up finding it?
Aw thats too bad. Sorry to hear. I lost my debit once I dont think I ever found mine either..
Scary situation loosing a card...Hopefully you get your new one quick!
Thats too bad! 
Im sorry to hear that. That can be a hard adjustment to make. 
Everything will work out fine. Stay strong youre going to find someone that completes you and you will see that it was for the better. 
Thats crazy I cant believe your dog survived. Did you end up putting him down?
Thats really impressive Im glad he was able to keep living and supporting you.
Thats great! What class was it for?
Wow! You must be very smart. Theres no way Id be any good at bioengineering.
Oh Im sorry. I can image how you feel. My son and his wife are trying to get pregnant right now as well. 
Aw thats so awesome! Congratulations! 
How will you keep them out? It must be something that you can do.
Thats a good attitude. I wish you have better luck next time.
Congratulations! Thats awesome! How long have you two been together?
Hah! That is a long time! Thats so exciting for you though. I hope wedding planning goes well and is super fun for you!
LOL that sucks. What are you gonna do?
Hopefully he stays there and catches those rats!!!
Do your friends not get along with your brother?
Makes sense its hard to bring things like that up with friends but if you explain your feelings to them Im sure theyll understand.
Thats so great! What type of cat is it?
Thats amazing! Maybe you can plan to see her more often?
Oh no! That mustve felt awful Im sorry!
Im sorry you had to go through that! I bet you find someone better for you anyway.
thats sweet. You guys must have a great relationship.
Thats great. How long have you been married?
Oh nice! I need one of those! My couch is so uncomfortable. It would be hard to get out of a new recliner for me as well.
Ugh! Its cool that she got a double so you guys can sit next to eachother as well.
Nice that it worked out so well for you! What brand did you end up going with?
Wow thats some high praise I might just have to try it out myself!
Oh heck no! Were you able to get back to sleep?
Ew yeah I would have been in the same boat. Did you go sleep on the couch after that?
I suppose it is but I wonder if the fact that you studied might have had more to do with it?
Well I am glad you got a good score. And faith is not a bad thing.
 it is a good sign of positivity i guess.. 
yes.. only thing we should do is to be patience and the rest will be okay ..
Oh really! What did you do?!
Oh my goodness! Congrats! How long were you two together before you took the plunge?
Oh wow! Ive been waiting for 6 years for mine to throw a ring on this finger. still waiting! lol
oh no what happened
well i had one that did that and he lived to 17 so there may still be hope
Thats awesome. Ive been to a lot of countries but would love to go to Italy. I am envious.
Thats pretty cool. I hope you get to go back.
How exciting.   What do you plan on seeing while there?
I am jealous.  I love being out in nature
I had a cat named Barney too! We was a oneeyed grey tabby. What kind of ornament is it?
Wow thats quite a long life for a cat. Im glad you got to enjoy so many years with Barney.
Thats not a bad response how did the team take it?
Thats great Did yall win?
That sounds bad. I know it wasnt intentional but what happened? 
Well you did what you were supposed to do. Its their fault for saying what they said. 
Why? were you mad?
Oh no! thats embarrassing. I hope everyone was too drunk to remember. lol
awe man thats the worst
thats really sucks
Oh no thats awful!  What happened to your dog?
Sorry to hear that.  That must have been tough at that age.
That sounds terrible but Im sure its happened to other people before. 
You shouldnt let one bad incident ruin water parks for you. Youre probably the only one that remembers and still thinks about that incident.
What happened? Did you finish the project?
Wow that sucks. Sounds like its your bosses fault. Did he take the blame?
Well good luck with your future projects or your future job.
Oh no! Hopefully that is the first time that has happened.
That is terrible! Especially since it was the whole day. Are you planning to punish her?
Lol.  I love it.  That is a great way to remind her of why she shouldnt lie.
I bet she wont do that again
Help them move and then have them take you out to the brewery as thanks.
I dont drink so have a drink for me lol.    
oh man. was just talking to someone about that type of thing. i had a pet dog who was hit by a car back when I was in jr high. i have friends who have recently lost their lifelong pets and i know theyre still reeling to some extent.
i will indeed. thank you. back at ya.
Wow! Do you know what kind of car youre getting yet?
Thats amazing. I bet you can barely contain yourself!
i am very good
dont worry I think everything will turn out right and your fears will disappear
Was she wanting to go with friends?
I know you just never know how she will handle a dangerous situation. I talk to mine all the time about things that could happen. 
pull what off?
wow that is so nice. you both should be really happy
yes you have to put forth alot of effort in order to see good result. good for her. 
Thats a long time! You and your partner must really love eachother.
I hope I have that one day! I bet these next ten years are even better than your last.
It feels good to be in a new place but the moving process sucks. Is it a new part of town?
I get that. My city is going through that right now too. I moved to the suburbs and love it so far.
hey how are you?
16 hours thats a long time
im doing well
what cause the AC to go out
Me too it is to stressing
Wow looks like you are extemely organized no offense
Thats good! It can sometimes be hard trusting others with expensive belongings.
Thats great! Did she teach you how to drive?
Well it is good that you did not marry him. I had a husband who cheated.
Consider yourself very luck. A leopard never change his strips.
I bet you were embarrassed. 
Sounds like you learned to knock on the door first lol.
Did you mean rain?
I like rain myself. Weve been getting a good amount here during the past month or so. 
Weve had an uncharacteristically mild summer. Im hoping it continues. 
thats horrible divorce is the last result. 
are the kids old enough to understand whats going on?
i guess thats a positive. they can understand that their life will be somewhat different
I remember that too its interesting transitioning to a more independent lifestyle.
Thats great I imagine that you still missed your family while getting involved and having new experiences.
That must have been frustrating. What did you do? 
That made me laugh. And you are a great babysitter. 
Thats terrible. Did you confront your friend?
Im sorry. I hope you can work things out without too much drama.
Congratulations! Buying a car is a big investment. What was the first thing you did when you got your car. 
I happy for you. Buying a new car is a big deal. 
Oh no! Did they stick around to exchange info?
Oh good. At least they were responsible enough to that with you. Im glad your ok.
i love meat loaf
sounds good what made you go low carb?
ok i do low carm too
You mean the kitchen staff?
I try not to think to much about kitchen sanitation when I go out to eat. 
Oh no! Do you have a suspect?
I hope it turns up or is returned to you soon.
Shes balling hard Im sure that her new toy will serve as motivation for you.
Thats splendid and it should help you decide if you want an interior similar to hers or completely different in the future.
Awww. Im sorry to hear that. Aretha means a lot to you I see
Im sure. She was a very good singer. 
Aww my mom used to listen to her too? Did she sing along and dance like mine did too? Used to love that when I was little.
Aint that the truth! Miss those days.
Why what happened? 
Thats a present that you love and it can love you back. Thats the best present. 
Sometimes its good to face our fears or turn on every light in the house.
I dont I think could quit without the satisfaction of knowing how it ends.
Thats awesome. My wife and I will hopefully be in that same boat soon. Was he excited?
Thats awesome. I cant wait to experience it.
but i bet you feel all better now right?
thats really good. Everything went okay?
wow thats so awesome! make sure you take care of yourself
these months will fly by so fast
Yeah it might be a good idea to tell him. But you may want to have the money to give back to him first. 
Hopefully legal drugs.  But either way I think you should tell him and give him his money. But you know your brother better than me. 
hey thats awesome! You wont have to steal money like me. Which University was it?
Oh a Christian University that is nice. Well I needed my drugs
oh okay thats good. I should apply because of my diabetes insulin is expensive. 
Wow. Did the other person know what was going on?
Well thats good. Sounds like it all worked out pretty well.
Thats good. I hope she found someone who treats her well.
Thats really sweet. I bet your nervous though.
Sibling rivalries are unfortunate. Hopefully you two can patch things up one day?
Ah i see. I hope you end up going and find a way to enjoy yourself. Family is all that matters in the end. 
Thats great. Any specifics?
Im glad things are on the right track.
Aw thats sweet. What was it?
That sounds way better than the stuff I would try to make for my mom when I was little!
Oh no how scary! What did you do?
I dont blame you snakes are scary! Do you know what kind of snake it was?
Hopefully far far away!
nice its good to be organized before you go on vacation
i hope you have a good time
good weather is always nice while on vacation. you are so lucky
That is impressive.  Is he normally pretty handy?
Thats so awesome! I want to get to that point some day.
Thats awesome. Id be excited too. What are you going to get with it?
Thats fun. I just watched that move this weekend. I really enjoyed it.
Is that uncomfortable for you?
Ok well I hope it comes out ok for you.
Congrats! Did they just come in and say hey guess what youre getting promoted
Thats cool. Guess all that hard work pays off!
Im sorry to hear that.  Do they know what the issue with his heart is. 
Thats good. Im glad it wasnt something urgent and he got to finish in the garden. 
Did your team not do so good? I know mine sure didnt.
I like Chicago. How bout you?
Nice I like them too.
That would make me sad too.  Was there any reason she took your friend and not you?
Lol well thats rude! Hopefully you guys are better now!  Little grudges like that stink I like to just put them behind me and move on.
Oh no. I hope thats not the end of the story. Did you find it? 
Thats sad hopefully it finds its way home. 
oh no who messes up bbq
probably bad meat
Oh boy was it someone you didnt want to talk to?
You can never be too careful! Ive heard too many things in the news. Who did it end up being?
haha good for you!  Where were you?
my dear thats gross
oh i bet
Yes that is annoying! How long did you have to wait?
Wow thats no fun at all. I guess you could look at it as money saved.
very cool! how old is she?
thats incredibly thoughtful! 
Is it a stray or a pet?
Well thats nice of you. Ive always been a dog person myself.
Oh me too. Have you been saving up for a good one this year?
Very cool. Im looking forward to thanksgiving too. love turkey dinner.
Yes family is my favorite part.
ooh! I forgot about hot cocoa!
what changed your mind about the car
oh i can see why now youve had a change of heart about the car. thats awful
i would have been horrified
Ah that is cool. Good to get it while he is still performing.
For sure. Not an avid listener but definitely heard some of his stuff.
Oh no! Did anyone come over to help or did you try to get out of there asap?
One thing Ive learned is that it might be embarrassing for a couple minutes but most of the time an hour later nobody will remember what happened.
I do love new sheets. The higher the thread count the bette
What thread count did you go with?
dang. Good job.
Whew always a rough time. How do you think you did?
For sure. Were they hard?
Did you end up getting that job?
Oh awesome. I would have been nervous to if it was something I really wanted. glad you got the job.
Yes thats the worst. And I laughed when I read that. 
That had to be traumatic. 
Oh no! Thats awful was anything valuable stolen?
Im so sorry! I would be so upset. Did you file a report with the police?
Close call! i would be pretty upset to lose my wallet. 
wow lucky it got turned in with cash in it. Be more careful in the future! hah
Exciting! Were you nervous going in?  Did you take your test?
Congrats!  That had to feel good!  Hopefully youre happy zipping around the roads now and safe too!
That is very exciting I bet you are nervous for your presentation. A lot is riding on it.
It is normal to feel nervous when working on something so important. I try to remember that it will soon be over. That helps me sleep. 
That is scary! Have you been watching the weather?
Rain can be such a damper. Make sure to be safe and carry around an umbrella if you go anywhere!
Im sure if you can let people know that youre back blogging theyd come back to see what youre up to now!  What do you blog about?
That sounds amazing!  I havent played tabletops in forever.  The last one I played was called Car Wars and it was at a New Years party.  It was loads of fun!
that is terrible i hope you were not hurt
too bad about your car but the main thing is that you were not injured.
that is nice family is fun to be around
i hope he gets it
Oh wow I bet you were very scared. Guessing you found your way ok?
Thats awesome! I bet you were glad those people came along.
Sounds like fun. When will you play?
Sounds like you will be well prepared.
Oh my gosh!!! Thats pretty funny. Did anyone see what happened?
Thankfully you had a sweater but geez how embarrassing. 
Girl take that drink and dont be ashamed. At least you wouldnt have to pay for the drink!
Thats when you say politely Ill take the drink but not your number. Nothing to feel guilty about since you would be using your manners. 
That is really exciting I bet it will be hard to let them go.
It is so exciting to watch them grow up I am sure it will be an emotional moment. But it will be a good one.
Were you looking for something in particular or just for fun?
I bet it did! Were they photos of family or friends or all of the above?
That is awesome! Congratulations. I can just imagine how excited you were.
You made your coach proud and your family.
How many years ago was it? What happened?
Four years is such a long time! Its always the quiet ones you have to look out for haha.
I wish you both all the best in the future.
You must be really looking forward to that. Sounds exciting!
Oh yes enjoy the beautiful beaches and feel the sand between your toes.
Christmas is so much fun! Are you asking for anything in particular?
Oh wow! Thats a big gift! I hope you receive it
Thats great!  Congrats to her!  I bet she worked hard.
I bet!  Shes going to have so much fun

start planning now
That is so nice to hear! You have a full house again! Did they have a good time?
Oh yeah! I hear you! A house full of kids is always crazy. Haha
i would have passed out!
i would have ran to my car! and hauled butt
Why? How much did you eat?
Wow! Was it good anyways? Maybe you could buy more?
Im sorry. I now that must have been a let down. Can you guys reschedule?
I bet you did. Hopefully you can do something with her soon.
Im crossing my fingers for you.
Oh no! What happened? Did you get into an accident?
That has happened to me before too. The car started swaying side to side from the rear tires but I just took my foot off the gas and let the car do what it wanted until I was able to stop. So scary! I know how you feel.
Oh no! I bet you were mad! Was she very sorry?
Siblings! You love them but sometimes they can be such a pain!
yeah i love my little fur baby too thats really makes me sad to hear that
That is daring! I do hope that you will win. What are the prizes?
Okay well. I wish you all the best of luck.
Oh no! That is horrible! Did you do anything?
Good for you! Animals need people like you! Very heroic! 
Oh yikes! Is your dog ok?
Awwww I am sorry to hear that. That is a terrible thing to experience. I hope that you are ok.
I am so sorry to hear about that treasure the memories that you have about your dad.
It is such a good thing to have to have people around who helps.
I am happy for you and hopefully things will get better.
Oh no! What did you do about it?
I can understand that Hope he was able to take care of it for you.
Aw that is terrible. Hopefully you did not have much money inside. I guess the worst part is all the cards that have to be replaced. So sorry to hear this. 
Ouch! You know that you can replace all those cards online now. A bit easier than it used to be.
i agree with you on that one it can be very frustrating seeing that all the time
Yeah i agree 100 percent.  Its not a good look to make someone look perfect when in reality nobodys perfect
Thats a big change adjusting well?
Nice sometimes a change of scenery is good. I need to move out of this crap state. 
haha I live in TN
Nice i have friends there i live in lavergne.
That is great news!! ...... but a little scary at the same time. lol
Well you have to let them spread their wings at some point. 
Well thats a good sign. He knows you probably miss him and he wants you to know hes thinking aboutcha.
Honestly worrying about that kind of thing is human. Literally everyone does it to some degree if they care about the other person no matter how secure they say they are. So youre in good company!
Oh have they done the draw for that yet?
Oh you would have been so excited and then disappointed! Im sorry!
Oh wow Ive never heard of a dog DNA test before. What is it?
That is so cool! Is it expensive to do?
I bet he does. 
Just sit him down and tell him.
Dont be afraid! You are smart. You are strong. Youve had enough.
That is gross. Did you find out who left it there?
The old tuna sandwich.
Well hopefully you threw it out.
Maybe it tasted good as well.
Oh thats awesome how come?
I hope you enjoy it! Where are you going ?
Amen to that food is better when you dont cook it.
omg did you hurt yourself bad
lol i could imagine it to break the ice on your first day you will always remember that day
lol too funny
Im pretty sure Ive done something similar to that about a hundred times in my life so dont feel bad lol. He would probably laugh about it now if you told him.
What are brothers for am I right? The absolute best response to something like that at least between siblings is just to get that sweet payback.
Was it a good one? Did you keep it?
Is someone getting married or a baby?
Well tell them I said Congrats on whatever it is. As long as its not a baby marriage.
Keep it secret Keep it safe....
cross country thats awesome

It sounds like your dad really loves you! To gift you something like that. 
What type of cake was it. I love cake wish I could have a slice.
It must have been very pretty and tasty.
Lightening and thunder has always scared me too. But rain is lovely. Especially in the spring.
Or how about on a tin roof? That is the ultimate relaxation.
Uh oh.... Im afraid to ask how did it go?
I lent my credit card to my sister one time and it did not go well. She still owes me to this day.
I am great how are you?
Sure vent whatever you need.
Oh did you try them on? Its pretty normal when my mom came home one day she found me in her nightgown and highheels pretending I was going to her job.
Well if you feel thats truly you be honest and if they cant handle it find someone who can. 
Do you feel overall that you worked harder than he had throughout school?
I see. Do you have any resentment? Have you done anything to take matters into your own hands to get where youd like to be?
Thats great. It seems like youve only gotten stronger and thats an important trait to develop in life. Be proud of what you can accomplish on your own and your independance!
Thats exciting! Are you happy to see him?
How wonderful. I hope you two have a great time together.
Thats awesome! Is he a starter? I bet you were super proud of him!
Good grades good athletics he sounds like a model kid! I hope when I have kids that they turn out to be successful like yours.

Its always nice to get unexpected good surprises.
You mustve spent a while preparing. Did you get the job?
Thats so awesome! hopefully youre enjoying it?
Thats amazing! Where did you move to? Did you lose anything on the way?
Thats such an unbelievably satisfying thing isnt it? When you have JUST enough space to fit everything. I wish you the best of luck in Outdoorsman School. If I ever get lost in a National Park Im gonna be looking for you to come save me.
How commendable! Congratulations! That is a wonderful accomplishment.
Yes you should be. Giving back to communities is very charitable.
I live on a farm and take care of many animals.

Im glad things have worked out for you.
Its always exciting when you know a package is on the way!
I love eBay! I just found a doll that my daughter wanted for much cheaper than in the stores.
That is thoughtful. Recycling is a great way to help the environment.
Oh that is a bummer. Oh well everyone is entitled to do what they want
The hamburger? Those can be tasty.
Oh well hamburgers arent the healthiest things.
Why do you feel bad about it?
Thats unfortunate. Do you have anyway of contacting the buyer now?

i imagine all puppies are adorable and lovable
Thats disgusting. I would never eat there again.
Oh gosh What did he do?
Oh my god! is the child ok?
I hope you dont have to put your friend down accidents happen.
Congrats they can really scare you at the doctotrs.
Oh that sounds like fun! Has it been a long time since you have seen him?
Oh that sucks! He doesnt sound like such a good friend I guess.
Oh no. I hope it wasnt something dangerous.
Awww man yeah the retail stores tend to change some stuff up and sometimes it feels like you have to start all over again but Im sure you can push through! 
Im glad its not all different though. Im sure the trainer will be really nice to train you because you sort of know whats going on but just need a run down for the new responsibilities !
Well hopefully the 4 days did good and hey guesses are 5050 right.
I think you did fine even if you had to guess you probably made an educated guess hopefully your subconscious remembered more. 
Did anyone try to bid against him? 
Wow did he buy anything cool?
Haha did you eat some ice cream?
Uh oh I think you might have been in trouble the next day.
Wrecks can be a scary thing to just miss. Was it the other persons fault?
Split second decisions save lives 
Thats cool. The N64 was a huge step up for enjoying your alone time for me.
I sold mine a long time ago and i regret it. 
I should do that i dont know why i havent

Ugh. I hate horror movies.. I swear I could be a grown 50 year old man and still have trouble sleeping because of horror movies!!
that was brave of her

Everyone feels that way when comparing themselves at those things. Except the pompous ones from school those guys suck haha.
Ohhh I am sorry to hear that. I know your pain very well. Are you ok?
That is good. It sounds like you were able to be with her before she left. She is in a better place now.
Im so sorry to hear about your father. Thats so awesome to hear about the support you received though!
WOW! Thats incredible! What an awesome human being
Anything you have in mind for you?
Well I hope your wants come to fruition .
Haha why is that? Do you already have too many?
Ah screw them. Live your own lives.

Well hopefully you can get together with them again soon. I know it stinks to get excited about plans and then have them fall through.
Yea being alone can really get to someone head.
Thats good! Have you thought about getting an outside job?
Well six months is a long time maybe you could get a seasonal job.

Yeah moving can be so stressful and expensive sometimes.
Oh my gosh! It isnt your fault!!!
I have ran over animals as well. It is an unfortunate reality.
Do they understand it was an accident?
It could be much worse. They could blame you and you would feel even worse. You should feel better with time.
Oh how exciting! Where are you going?
You are going to have such a great time and make memories you will cherish the rest of your life
You enjoy it a lot of people never travel so be thankful for the experience and soak up everything like a sponge
I would agree that you do enjoy your trip!

Well cherish them and what they represent and you will be awesome.
Why was she yelling at the cashier?
I feel a little bad for the cashier.
I agree. So many people are inconsiderate of workers.

Thats amazing for someone that age. And his voice was still good?
Thats so sweet! What kind of necklace is it?
Neat! Did he find it while metal detecting? What a treasure that is! It had a double meaning to him!

That is good to hear! Do you think they can do it again next year?
Did you end up getting them to for you?
Wow sorry to hear that. 
Its a big step for anyone and can really make you feel like you have something tangible you worked for.
No Where I live in Colorado  it would be the size of a match box for way too much money.
That is sad. Were you in the running for the job?
Oh. Well that makes senseI supposed. Still sad. 
You should at least clear the air with him so that you dont have hard feelings
Yeah but it happens and you should both try to move forward
Aww that is really sweet! how did her do it?
I think he might be the one for you!
Oh gosh. Thats awful... sorry you had to experience that. What did you do after finding it? 
Aww. I wonder how he died.. poor raccoon. Even if they are sneaky little creatures its pretty sad. 
Did you go with her anyway?
I understand that.
Oh dear. Were you late?
That is sad. I hope everything turned out okay. 
Did you trip on something or injure yourself?
It happens to everyone at some point Ignore the jerks and know that they will forget about it for the next thing that comes along.
ooh cool! Did you win?
You did good! There is always a luck factor involved.
Thats so annoying. I hate traffic! Was there an accident or was it just rush hour?

Hopefully they made a taping of it for you to have.
Thats weird. Are they friends?
Oh wow. I bet you were upset. Are you going to ask him about it?
Im sorry you are going through this.
Like the kind a cat vomits or came off of a brush? Im hoping for you it came from a brush
Oh my goodness for a lack of better terms! I would be no good after that
Oh man I hope everything is ok  and it was something mildly annoying like a tree limb.
My dog would of looked around like wasnt me daddy i cross my paws.
Somethimes that is good it keeps you on pace

Well you should if its weighing on you.
What was wrong with it?
Oh thats so gross! I would have sent it back too

Thats great I am sure you will achieve success there.

Its always a blessing to have certain times in life where no problems are occurring!

Neat! What was the case?
That is a victory! Those pesky parking tickets can be a pain sometimes!
Im sorry to hear that. what did you decide to do?
Yeah that seems like the best thing to do
Being happy where your life is has got to be one of the best feelings. Im happy for you!
Its all about what you do with those bumps and just pushing through them I think.

Oh my gosh Im so sorry! Where are you staying now?
I cant imagine what youre going through. That must be extremely hard.
Ugh thats the worst especially when you just strictly looking. Were you planning on buying?
Yeah. Pushy salespeople are so annoying though! They accomplish the opposite of their goal when they become too overpowering over their customers.
o no i hope no one noticed
Yeah i would not think about it to much.
That is good that you feel better! What happened to change your perspective?
I see! Well selfexploration and reflection is usually really productive!

That sounds exciting.  Was there a prize?

Oh that is wonderful I know that means a lot to you. It has great sentimental value I am sure.
I am sure it did and I know you will treasure that mug. Put it in a special safe place on display so you see it every day..
Oh wow. Good for her! Does she have a great job to afford such a great lifestyle?
Im sure that much be hard to stand by and watch as someone who works hard for their things. 
I love Sonic! I used to go as a kid a lot as well. They have the best shakes.
I bet going to one again brought back a bunch of wonderful memories.
no idear who that is but im sure you liked it
Thats an unfortunate situation. Whats the diagnosis?
I see. He should probably get that checked out by a doctor. Its best to check out these things I think.
That is terrible to hear hopefully you didnt injure anything more than your pride.
Well maybe your boss was one of them and you get some brownie points for trying to get to work quickly
Wow im sorry to hear that
That is awesome! Im glad it worked out
Are you tired or do you have early plans tomorrow?
Oh thats exciting! There is nothing like relaxing on the porch in the evening. 
Oh thats cool! How many do you have?
Sounds lovely! I bet it brought back a lot of memories.
Do you have fond memories of it
Thats so unfortunate. My condolences. Is there anything you can do to help?
I wish your friends mom all the best. A miracle could happen!
What did you do!
Yeah it must have been!
Oh no! Are you okay?
Ouch! That sounds painful. You poor thing.
Well it should be ok and dont feel guilty. Two cookies are not that big of a deal
You may feel a little guilty and I understand that Maybe run to the store and pick up more?
Congratulations on getting that far! What position is it?
Nice! That is a good role! Do you like a leadership position?
Thats terrible whats wrong?
Thats awful I hope things get better for you.
Is it a good one?
Tell me.  I want to hear it.
Thats no fair.  Your friend will never know.
Why whats wrong?
And did it not go over well?
Were you able to find someone?
Well thats great  Someone you trust too.
That sounds so sweet its always nice to look back on fond times.
Sometimes all we have is our memories.
Youre such a naughty person.  What did she do?
Oh no.  That didnt go well then.  Look for a ring next time.
What makes you feel lucky?
Thats so sweet of you!
Im guessing you must have had a family memeber die?   Im so sorry for your loss.   
THat must be tough to deal with.  I cant imagine losing a parent!
Does a guest house mean you rent it out or you let family and friends stay for free?
Taht sounds lucrative! I have a place in Big sky MT. it worked out very wellas far as renting.
Whys that? Are you worried about driving?
Ahha! Do you know anyone in your family whos good at bargaining? Maybe the salesperson is a hardbargainer.
Wow I wonder if she knew that you two were together. Did she know that you saw her?
She totally knew! I guess its flattering to know your partner is good looking enough to have a woman stare him down like that.
I have been there done that.  I used to be a dog groomer and I love dogs.   Its so sad to go the pound and see all the homeless dogs.
I usually deal with it by not going to the pound anymore to look.   I had a dog die in a house fire not long ago and I am just not ready for a dog.
Im such a scaredy cat when it comes to scary movies. What was the movie about?
Oh gosh. Thats terrifying! I dont know anyone who likes those kind of movies!! 
wow. That is amazing I love to change. What color did you choose? 
Nice. I would like to do the same but it is very expensive where I live. I hope I can afford it one day.
Woo! Where are you headed?
Omg! Europe is my absolute favorite place in the world. I recently came back from Italy and Greece 2 months ago and loved it!
Well I went to Venice which I absolutely loved but it was very crowded. I hear Florence is beautiful too! In Greece I recommend Santorini or Mykonos if you wanna party! 
Yay! Its BEAUTIFUL. If you go you will love it. 
Oh wow where you in the area when it happened?
Thank Jesus! lol I am glad you are OK.
Same. Its hard to predict.
How did you accomplish this?
Where do you keep everything?
Do you have some sort of method of organizing everything?
How much stuff did you have to go through?
Well its always a good thing to keep a promise. Can I ask what the promise was?
Well I applaud your dedication and faithfulness in making sure you kept the promise good job!
See things work out well when you make doing the right thing a priority. I am glad you followed through on it
Ah its ok we all amke mistakes. Are you in a new town?
Good! I bet you got it down much faster after making a mistake.
Did you move in a better home? 
WOW thats so convienient.
Well at least you dont have to worry about him begin ok in life. He can take care of himself now. You can give him tips on making better choices with his money
I understand.My little brother did too.. I have the family and he has the career. We are 10 years apart but he make a ton more money than I do. Maybe you can get your brother to invest in homes and you all start a business.
Right you should! Remember they arent making any more land!
Wholesaling would be an great options. You could go on Youtube and find tons of videos about flipping homes with no money.. but if your brother has a little change.. Well.. Go Brother! lol
I will go out on a limb and say she didnt hold up her end hope you get your garden back bright and beautiful
I understand the frustration a good garden takes time and patience I have no doubt you will grow it back better than before
No problem I got faith in you really enjoyed this chat
Awwww.. what a heart warming moment. That was so sweet of you to do! 
Thats so cute! Turtles running around?! Haha!! I have a rabbit he loves to hop around my house too!
Good luck.  That sounds really frustrating.  Hope everything was backed up.
Sounds like a good plan.  I hope its simple and you can get it working again.
Do you have experience fixing computers?
I hear you.  Technology is supposed to make things simpler.  Not always the case.
Oh yeah? Nice to hear. What exactly did you do?
Thats awesome Im from Kansas and first went to Colorado just a couple years ago. It was beautiful!
I agree though always a good time to get away and explore some nature life.
Well Im pleased to hear you had a fun time. Hope you get to do it again soon.
Wow it must have been good feeling
Oh man Im so sorry. How did it happen?
That is so sad. Did you see it happen?
ooh sorry to hear that was it by itself?
sorry. Probably the driver did not see her
wow. Am happy for you just commit to it and it will thrive
all the best
did you tell them to stop speaking?
i bet .Next time call the people in charge
Oh dear. did they pull you over?
Were you speeding? I would have been nervous too.
I see. Well I hope all you got was a ticket.
oooh thats so scary and bad of them
Thats worrying she need help
My friend and I were out at the bars one night doing the usual young people thing. They had been acting off a little all night and when I asked if they were okay they told me everything was fine. I knew this wasnt true since I had known this person for years but the night came to a close and we got a cab home. 
Im sorry you felt that way. Is it any better now?
Your friend must trust and care for you a lot to confide in you like that. how did you react?
Thats good. you must have been surprised by the confession.
Wow! I hope he doesnt do anything too crazy!
I hope you have as much fun as he does!
Oh thats great. Were you able to help him move?
Well at least you were able to introduce him to your friend. I hope everything works out for him!
Sometimes going out with friends can relax the mind who knows you might ace the test .
That stinks  cheer up and try again 
hello why whats happened ?
you founded the preacher helpful ?
I never did go to a preacher.
What was the secret about?
I wont tell anyone! Come on just one juicy detail??
I am really sorry to hear that.  How are you healing from it?
Thats good.  Im glad you had good doctors to help you get back on your feet no pun intended.  Are you having o be out of work?
I mean did they reward your 25 years of service at your job by giving you a present or throwing you a party. Its pretty common for workers when they reach such a milestone to be recognized in such a way.
You shouldve made them buy another cake!
thats great are you enjoying it?
thats awesome im glad they were helpful!
Oh Im so socially awkward and anxious Id never be able to give a speech. How did it turn out?
Im so happy to hear that! Practice does make perfect.
Oh I am so sorry to hear that.  I hope that she will be alright. Is it serious?
Oh no! Well you better spend as much time with her as you can now. It could be any time she leaves. Oh what a heard situation you are going through! If you need a friend I am always here for you.
Thats very lucky how much was it for?
Yeah I can understand its definitely a pleasant surprise.
Thats good to be able to depend on others.
Thats so true life is very fragile and I find it easy to forget that.
Its nice to be loyal to people who are loyal to you.  Is your job going to offer you any benefits for your loyalty?
Why did you choose to stay?
Food is the hardest part when it comes to getting healthy sometimes. Dont give up! 
Omg! Okay now I understand how difficult it really must be for you! 
Oh my that must have been frightening! Poor little cat what happened afterwards?
I can just imagine maybe she wanted a bath. Glad to know she wasnt harmed.
That sould make me feel sad. Did you talk to him about it?
Thats not very nice. I think it is just better to be honest even if it might hurt.
I certainly know that feeling.
You can always improve that anytime you want to.  I have faith in you.
Do you plan on paying him back quickly? 
I mean its pretty crappy to take anything from anyone but hes your brother so it is slightly less crappy as long as you pay him back! 
Uh oh.  Im sorry to hear that.  That is never a good thing to do as a supervisor.
Unfortunately he wins out when you do that because it will likely continue.  Again I wish you had been treated so unkindly.
Something juicy I hope. 
Whoops! Did she take it with anything approaching a sense of humor?
Oh no! I am afraid to ask what it was.... but what was it?
Yuck! You better put a trap up there. You know they have these wireless web cams these days for really cheap so it may be a good idea to get one of those so you know for sure if you have an infestation.
Oh dear. Is it what I am thinking? Did she wreck it?
I am so sorry to hear about that. The good thing is she is okay
I would be upset as well
Wow thats really great that they pitched in to help. You must be happy about that!
The more hands the quicker the work!
Making moves to do better is all you can do.  How has it been going?
That is great!  The longer you do it the easier it will get.  Keep up the good work!
What were you invited to speak about?
Its hard to condense a pep talk into nice little one liners. But I think if you just go for it breathe deeply a bunch and pretend its just you in that room I think youll do great!
i hate to ask what happen I imagine something went wrong
that is the problem with cheating you have to live with it especially if you have a conscious all I can say is to use this promotion as a lesson to better prepare yourself next time
Had she been bothering you recently?
I get that. I dont respond well when people are rude to me.
What a pain!  I think when a big company makes so much money and they say they
Oops sorry I didnt finish my thought.  I think they make enough money to handle it and that inconvenience is worth 80.  Plus now youll definitely buy again with them so I think it works in their favor and yours!
Thats awesome. Its wonderful to feel prepared!
Now you just have to keep up that same energy all year thats the difficult part.
Congradulations.   You must be excited and proud.   Are you enjoying the new car?
Oh no!  Hopefully you have full coverage? 
Yeah but its better than having no car!
Does your insurance have the new care replacement  option?
That is great!  When is the wedding?
Are you having a bachelor party?
The best kind of bachelor party.  That is exactly what I did for mine...20 years ago.
You should make it an annual trip!  Then you can always be reminded of a good time in your life.
How much did she give you over
Most places will make her replace the 10 so you should really go back to there and explain what happened
That sounds like he startled you quite a bit hope it wasnt a black cat.
Awww well other than the heart attack giving sounds like a cute cat
I am sorry to hear that. How did that make you feel?
I feel your pain. I hope you had someone to lean on.
I have not seen the message about the incident but I do hope that person will speak to you.
That was the right thing to do. You respect your marriage.
Awesome. I love my mate too. That coworker is very out of order! 
Im sorry you had to go through all that stress. But yay for you being able to leave that situation!
Thats great to hear. It sounds like its a well needed change. Things will look up from here!
Do you trust your friend?
Thats great.  Its good to have a friend you can trust that much.
Would it be a promotion?
I hope you make the right choice!
That is a pretty weird thing to have happen
Maybe you should contact the news about it
Sounds like somebody needs an accountabilibuddy...
Wow you should probably tell her so that lies and decent dont become commonplace in your marriage.
That is not ok to do.
Yeah people like that are jerks
He must have been very excited! That is awesome.
Ah. You must do it more often. Children are so precious.
Oh no! Did they take you to jail?
Yeah I wouldnt feel to good about myself either but at least no one got hurt including yourself.
Oh my it must have been an exciting time for you seeing your brother after such a long time
I can understand why it would be a little nerve wracking but I am glad you caught up with him
Sounds scary. Did you find out what it was?
Were there any recent events in your neighborhood that would make you worry?
you should go to their place
that is sad that they cant atleast talk to you
Oh no!  They are mean to not have told you.  I wouldve told you.  How did it even get there?
Oops!  Well just hold your head high because things happen to all of us and it doesnt speak to who you are as a person so just let it roll off your chest.  Shame that people are decent enough to help.
Hey I bet youll do great! Nothing to stress about. 
Just try to stay positive and get a good nights rest the night before and Im sure youll do amazing! Just have to go in with confidence.
Wow you must really be excited. Do you have room for it in your kitchen?
That sounds delicious! Can I come over?
Congratulations on the good raising of the kid! I bet you were just flooded with all kinds of memories.
Wow that is so sweet. Have you shown her it yet?
That just warms my heart thank you for telling me that.
Hail can be freaky! Was there any damage?
We dont get them too often here. Though theres usually a few tornadoes that touch down somewhere in the area each year. 
I bet that was nice though.
Does your high school do reunions where you could see them again?
Wow what happened next is he alright?
Wow what type of dog is he? Is he a big one that acts tough or a little one that needs lots of love?
Wow I actually love them! Did you take him to see a vet? You seem so concerned about him to even take time off work.
I am so glad to hear that. A healthy puppy makes everyone happy.
Nice!  What did you end up with?
I say if you can afford it enjoy it.  What is your favorite feature?
I havent but I would love to get one.  I love full feature phones!
Everything about getting something new like that is fun!
You must be very fond of such memories. Do they make you feel nostalgic?
Its always good to think about such moments I wish I could go back to these times.
Wow he did he do?
You must be so proud of him!
What am amazing feeling that must be!  Did it take you a long time?  Must have felt so satisfying.
Its paying off!  Thats awesome. How much can you bench?
I agree! Is she excited?
Haha Good for her! She is becomeing more independent! Do you know what kind of car?
Feeling sentimental much?
I know how you feel.  Ive got old rifles from both of my grand fathers... along with some WW II bring backs.  I dont think I could sell them.
Sorry to hear that. I hope youre not feeling too sad. 
I had no idea snakes even lived that long. I am sure he was a faithful buddy to you.
Maybe its time to find a new job?
Awesome.  Are you feeling a little jealous?
Dont worry Im sure shell put a dent in it before the month is up.
You should take a ride with her and try to get her to paralell park in a tight space or something
oh my goodness. Thats so cool. who did you show it to.
Wow love looking through memorable s. brings back good memories.
Yeah tell me about it. I have nothing from that far back from my family.
I will. I bet my aunt has some things to give me.
Yeah I know what you mean. Coffee always cures my headache. But then again it is probably not having coffee that causes the headache too.
I wish I could say the same. I am addicted. 
Why not? Is everything okay?
That must be somewhat frustrating at times.
Oh that is awful. The loss of a pet is just the worst
I hope it starts to not hurt so much. I always take forever to stop hurting from those things.
It is good to have people you can count on. If you cant trust your family who can you trust? 
Totally! I also have a very trusting family.
Thats unfortunate. I hope you didnt get chewed out too badly.
I guess they dont see it as just copy paper. To them stealing is stealing no matter how petty. At least you have the chance to change your ways and keep your job.
Sorry to hear that it must be absolutely devastating. But you must stay strong.
I am glad you have all the support you need. The important thing is your family is safe. 
What? Oh no! Can they do that?  I would fight it and see what happened.  You must feel sick.
I am so sorry.  That is awful. Definitely look into your rights as an accepted student who was counting on that and made all your plans around it.
Oh no! I take they still got their claws. mine is the same way but there is one piece of furniture he just insists on ruining.
oh my goodness. they got a taste of it and went to town. im so sorry.
Yep thats what I did with the chair mine messed up pretty bad.
Yeah Ive gone a few times actually. Do you like them?
Thats awesome! I wish you all the luck but I bet you wont even need it.
Its going to knock everyone dead! Ill be rooting for you
Oops! Do you think that you can replace it?
Oh know. I am sure your mother will forgive you. I was an accident and we all have accidents sometimes.
That was nice of you to do. What kind of dog does she have?
I love dogs! I am thinking of getting another one.
Oh my do you have a draft saved. Or was that the only copy?
It must have been so aggravating. I hope the due date wasnt the next day! 
Thats amazing!  Did you get i?
Waiting is the worst!  Well whatever happens is meant to be.  I wish you luck and success with your house!
Thats really great. Youre setting a good example for your kids too.
Thats really great! Your kids will thank you for giving them that important lesson.
That is a good place to be.  Are you happy with your job?
Im sure it will!
Yep more than that and you will need a big house and lots of toys! 
Aw I am sure you will be good parent to all of them. Kids are the greatest joy in life.
Really? That must be fun
That is so nice I wish I had a car like that.
Ugh do you have any security camera that might have captured what happened?
I hope so too. Its really annoying when that happens and just ruins your day. 
I hope you do very well! What subject?
I think you will do great!
Haha! That definitely must have scared many people that did not know what it was. That must be hilarious to watch!
hahaha I can imagine! I guess I would have done the same. I hope you got him back. Heehee
And you know when men get sick theyre on their death bed.
And you know when men get sick they act like they are dying.
Im sorry about that. What happened?
Wow that stinks. Hopefully she will be there for you next time if you ever need help again. 
It must be very difficult for you. Do you have someone you can talk to about it? I find that remembering the good times helps you keep their memory alive.
Thats great. Its nice to have family around that can help pick you up when you feel down.
Awesome! What are your plans for this weekend.
That is wonderful. I will be spending time at home.
That is so sweet. Family is very important
Thats awesome! What show?
Thats an interesting experience!
Has she had a history of illness?
Im sorry to hear that. 10 is still very young though so I hope you have plenty of more time to spend with her.
I have some of that too. It would make me a little nervous.
Ugh well I hope the best for you that it is all nice and intact when you get back.
Really? Why you should have been patient.
Oh dear. Maybe you were just a bit impatient but I am sure he will forgive you 
WOW! That is really cool! What will you buy?
Have fun spending it!
That must have been embarrassing wasnt it?
Did you retaliate against your boss?
Was it a prestigious or expensive vase?
Looks like it was just an accident. It happens and you shouldnt blame yourself for it.
Great since you are prepared Im sure you will do great!
If you could speak with someone that work there you could learn more about what to expect and what things they value the most but you certainly seem very prepared.
Its very scary! I live near the coast too! I dont know if my home will still be here in 50 years.
No Im not. Im hopeful that the deniers will start to come to their senses and maybe we can slow the warming of the earth.
I am so glad to hear everything is going well for you!. It is good to hear your health is improving.
That is a long time to suffer. It seems like it is a new day for you.
Oh no! Im so sorry!  Is she okay? That is so great that she has you.
I agree.  Be there no matter what.  I hope she heals quickly.  
Thats good that you trusted him. Sometimes I miss out on good opportunities because it is hard to trust.
Thats awesome. Thats a good amount for a little effort which is always nice. 
your intuition seems to be trustful and the right way to go
must be great to have that feeling of accomplishment and independent.
haha... you little thief! joking That must have been some good pizza!
Ahhh oh well. Dont beat yourself up. I am pretty sure that I have done something like that before too. I think it was with birthday cake. I love birthday cake!!!!!
Haha! No! Its not wrong! My son played travel baseball for 6 years and we spent 6 days a week at the ballfields!
Its a huge commitment for him and you! If you dont think you can do it I wouldnt sign him up. Theres no shame in that!
Wow! How did it go?
That must have made you feel pretty nostalgic!
That would really stress me out
That is just the worst feeling. Part of the reason I work from home
Oh they need to take care of that asap!
Well for your sake I hope it gets taken care of soon.
That awful!  Were you able to continue without it?  That must have really messed up your rhythm.
Did it start back up? Glad you were able to start over.
You are a good friend.
yes they deserve respect unless they do soemthing cruel.
Why did he move so far away?
Thats very sad.  Im sure hell be back to visit.
i hope your mom can understand  it was an accident and everyone makes mistakes 
lol well hope she doesnt notice
Was it a good feeling or a bad feeling?
I do too. Being a kid was so easy.
Also not having a ton of responsibilites!
Yeah I completely understand that.
Oh man thats a long break. How did it go?
Thats great! Did your co workers help?
Hahaha thats funny. my bad I feel like i need to hit the gym again as well.
Yea it sucks to go but feels great once you leave.
What did you get up to in August usually?
I used to love bonfires back in my day those were the days.
Agreed what was your favorite memory?
Whoa thats out of left field howd that happen.
Good for you! Are you going to tell your girlfriend about it?
You are an honest man as well. I salute you! A rare breed indeed.
Aww so cute! I bet your having such a fun time with himher!
Wow I didnt know you could litter train rabbits. Its always challenging house training a new pet. I hope he learns quick!
Oh cool. I love looking through my old photos. makes me feel warm and fuzzy.
Me too. I love to ponder about the good ole days. Did you share the photos with your friends or parents?
Oh no did it burn?
I hate when I do that but it is better for it to be cooked to long than not long enough....
That must of been fun where did you meet?
That is amazing. I hope I can get the family together soon.
Oh no thats terrible. Is there anyway to redo it?
You better prepare well for that final.
that sounds amazing I hope they enjoy it a lot!
It sounds like it will i hope you have  a great dinner!
Thats wonderful!  Are you thinking of proposing?
Thats a good thing to be financially prepared trust me.  My husband and I spent most of the money we had on a honeymoon and then struggled for years doing things the wrong way. Youre smart!
Wowza! That is a good spouse. Were you suprised?
Good i bet you deserved it. 
That is not good. Did they give you back your money? 
I would be upset too they need to do their work properly.
I am glad that you got it cleared up.
I hope so too you should have reported it to a supervisor or manager.
Why? Are you not happy with the job or you want to make more money?
Well I guess you should probably find a new job before quitting your present job.
I have had that happen before and it is super annoying!
I do not blame you one bit!
i used to get chased by dogs too  back then when i was younger fences were not to common
lucky you  i was bit a few times but it was my fault i provoked the dogs 
That sounds fun!  The arcades were always kind of noisy for me though.
You should go in a play some!
Oh thats so hard! How are you feeling about it? Itching to go back or dreading it?
Thats good! At least its someone you can trust instead of a stranger at a daycare center. 
Ouch! What did they do for it?
That sounds so painful! I hope it gets better fast.
That can be nerve wracking.  Are you worried?
Ah.  I find a mock interview with a friend can help.
That is smart of you. How did it go?
I am sure you will be OK. The doctors can be very scary sometimes but most people get scared about things that arent worth it.
that is so sad to hear it must be tough for you
wow that is a long time but remember you had great experience with her and will have fond memories for the rest of you life
Good job! Hopefully she deserves the faithful person you are!
I cant help but be a little jealous. haha
Its possible she is just trying to be helpful.
I can see how that would be really annoying. Just nod and say yeah. Thats what works for me.
Did he live up to the belief?
Thats great!  Im sure he appreciated that you trusted him.
How exciting for you. Kids truly are amazing. Now the fun really starts.
Now you will have to really be careful what you say around him. They tend to repeat everything they hear when you least suspect it.
That is great! Congrats!
I bet you are so happy you stuck with it.. definitely something to be proud of.
Aw will you be able to keep her company?
That is very thoughtful of you. You are a good sister!
Aw nice! Thats kind of cool actually. I hope you really encourage her to stick to it and do well. Sometimes there can be a lot of expectations that come with that stuff so whatever you can do to not add pressure to it would be great.
Yeah I think her parents or her peers or even herself probably may put  a lot of expectations on her. While you want to reassure and encourage her its good to not make her plan too far ahead in the future and put all that weight on her. Its what my parents did with me and I resented them for it.
I not sure what do you mean but can use my imagination  it sounds like something really embarrassing.
Yes what I thought  I guess your roommate must have been more embarrassed.
Dang i can relate i moved away from my mom a long time ago and still get a little homesick.
At least now a ways you can face time or call her to at least stay in contact.
I feel like this is me. Im clean but Im stuck with a dirty roommate who doesnt do dishes. And I also live in a place that is old and looks terrible to begin with. Sorry you have to deal with that because I know I hate living in it!
Me either. Ive always been a fairly clean person. Had to move out of my parents home for college and both roommates Ive had have been kind of messy. I dont know how people dont feel weird and uncomfortable making other people live inclean up their mess.
Oh no! That can be very scary! Did you make it out ok?
Was it a stranger or someone you knew?
Haha wow thats cool. 
Oh really what was the play?
That is awesome I remember Odell Beckham doing that a few years ago.
Thats horrible. Id talk to your best friend and tell him how you feel firstly.
If your best friend is truly a best friend of yours they wont leave you over this. It isnt right to tell his girlfriend in my opinion but it is good if you speak to him about the situation.
Whoop Whoop! Thanks for reminding me. I have to purchase youtube live for it.
Same here! Who is your team?
Nice! I asdly am a corn husker. its been a rough couple of years.
That must have been so fun!
It sounds like you have a great family!
I guarantee that you will be fine! I graduated with a masters last year
Environmental Engineering  my second engineering degree
Thats wonderful news. I have also battled depression and am feeling better now. That  is a real big deal.
Wow! congrats and keep it up. I know it helps me to stay really busy.
Thats nice to  hear. Its the best feeling when kids come back home to visit. 
Aw it must have felt so nostalgic going through old memories. Its nice to cherish them. 
Do you miss him?
Be sure to facetime or skype with him. That will help with the loneliness. 
Oh no thats terrible.  Is he in legal trouble?
This is such a difficult thing for you to go through.  I hope he learns from this and changes his path.
I understand. But you must cherish every moment because soon our babies grow up and become great adults.
Oh that is horrible. I am sorry that happened to you!
I dont blame you I wouldnt want to mess with that either. 
Why is that might I ask? Maybe I can help you reframe it better to look at it more positively.
Oh I see. Yeah it kind of stinks being around people who can afford things you would like. But maybe you can view it as you being more mindful and responsible with your money.
Thats very lucky of you what do you plan on doing now?
If you did have to move might I suggest Boston as an alternative?
Dont be nervous. I am sure you did alright. It is normal to think that but most of the time it is all in the head.
Oh good then there is nothing you should be worried about then.  Go relax and distract your mind on something else. All will work out my friend.
I hope you feel better soon. Maybe you can take a trip out to visit her?
I bet she really misses you. How far away did you move?
Oh wow thats really far! Well I hope you get to go soon and have a safe trip!
Yea that can be tough. What kind of dogs? Are they easy to train?
Yup. I did that with my new cat and it ended up working out OK.
Yup! I am sure you guys will get through it!
I can understand the anxiety Im sure youll do fine though!
Sleep is so important before an exam thats where all your facts and memories get better organized
im sorry theres nothing worse than that. i hope youre doing okay
im sorry. it eventually gets better though
thats nice to hear too many relationships ending nowadays
wow thats awesome good for you
oh no!  Im so sad to hear that 
Yeah thats all you can do I guess.  Do you do anything cool in his memory?
Oh no did heshe get better? Did you have to take them to the vet?
Oh dang there were multiple cats that were sick?
same cats are so awesome
haha mine loves to just lay on me and get pets hes so soft and cute
hes a rag doll with blue eyes and a white coat that ends in gray on his face tail and paws what about yours?
thats nice thank you for telling me about your cat
You must be so excited! What game did you get?
That actually got great reviews. I am sure you are going to love it!
Thats unfortunate. Did you have the flu?
Your next adventure will go much smoother. I once got a really bad rash in Hawaii when I visited.
Thats awesome where did you go?
I love california I have some family in Sacramento! And I bet it feels great to be home after a long drive.
Oh my Gosh. I am sorry. that can be really tough.
Thats the most important thing. I bet he wants you to move on and be happy.
Haha thats really cool! What kind of watch is it?
Oh nice. Yea he would be happy to know you are wearing it now.
Oh no. Did the workers have to come clean it up?
I bet you were a little embarrassed. I wouldnt worry too much about it. Im sure it happens everyday. 
That is so nice!  Did you get lots of presents?
So fun.  Did you have your baby? Congratulations on your pregnancy!
Ahh sounds like some great memories. Do you often feel nostalgic about these times?
Thats a great idea. That way your kids will get to experience such lovely moments as well.
Wow lucky you.  I hope you are enjoying your time there.  They will be appreciative of the gifts.
How much longer are you staying for?
To have some rest after working so hard it is very important.
It is a perfect leisure activity.
That sucks! It happens to the best of us. At least the computer didnt break.
Yeah that would have been an expensive accident! Your lucky. 
Holy cow thats awesome!  Who is it?
Hmm.  Never heard of them.  Ill look them up and give them a listen!  Hope you have fun!!!
Ha.  I actually live in KY. 
Yup.  We have a bluegrass event on the square once a year in the town that I live in
That is Good! How long have you been together?
Thats good! Sadly thats tough to find these days.
That is great.  Its good to not take family and friends for granted. 
Keep that attitude and you will go far!  
Those are the best timesI cant wait until my son plays.
He is 2!
Aww thats a great time in life.
Is he your first?
That is cool! What kind of car?
Those are nice cars! I hope you are able to get one!
Oh no whats wrong with your current car?
That sounds terrible. Im sorry I cant diagnose a car over the internet though. My first guess for that is usually the battery. Then things like the cables or the starter or fuses.
That is awesome. What type of dog do you have?
My motherinlaw has one too.
what are you going to do for his birthday
i love birthday gathers
What career do you work in?
You deserve a large raise health care is hard work!
Oh no.  Im sorry.  Was it due to a test?
Math is not my favorite.  Can you ask the teacherprofessor?
That is terrible i am sorry! hopefully youll be able to get it taken care of this time.
What type of degree are you getting?
Yea those shows are hard to watch. 
Yea I agree. People can commit some really horrific crimes. It is scary.
Was the date not going well?
I hate when that happens. Was she understanding?
Thats great I wish I had been that productive today. Maybe I still have time for a load of laundry. Good job you. 
I just havent been feeling too great today. Maybe your right though an easy task might make me feel better and get a head start for tomorrow. 
Is he okay?
ewwwww thats gross lol
Where?  Why are you feeling uncertain?
I can understand the nerves but it will be fun!
Well I hope you did the right thing and correct their mistake.
Oh thats the biggest pain.  I feel like when you pay good money for care for your pet...they should at least be on time.
We move our lives and schedules around to take care of our pets...the least the can do is do their work well.
I sure hope that you get it!
I believe you will get it!
thats right it is supposed to come out  soon I bet you will enjoy it very much
sound like it must be killing you on waiting for the release before you know it. youll be playing it a ton
That is awesome. I bet you feel great!
And its only going to get better. The longer you go the more progress you will see. Good for you.
Good job. Is she better now?
That stinks. I hope she feels better soon!
Wow what did you see?
Ugh I hope hes alright and it was nothing too bab.
Did he do a good job?
Thank god bet youre pleased about that arent you?
Oh my are you physically okay? It must have been very traumatic for you.
Money can always come back but your health is the most important thing.
Oh no thats no good. Did she find out?
Just have a talk with her and apologize. Im sure shell understand. Addiction is a life long battle. Its never too late to jump back on the wagon.
Uh oh!   You should go see a doctor to get that checked out!
Yeah thats what I would do!  Good luck friend!
What did you do?!
Lousy man! What can you do though...if youre a regular shell understand when you bring her extra another time.
sounds sweet you must be raring to go
lol the kid in you is always ready for Disneyland
I agree.  Has something bad happened to you recently?
Yeah it really can bring you down
Oh man thats scary! What set it off?
I can imagine i wouldnt have been at ease either.
Good luck! I bet youll get it I have a feeling.
No problem! Is it a career oriented job?
That is exciting what is the test for?
Oh ok cool are you already a police officer?
Wow thats horrible! Make sure to get a police report and send it to your insurance. 
Im sorry try to relax and have a good weekend. Know how fustrating that can be hope there wasnt much damage.
Awesome I am happy to hear that!
Nice make sure to soak it up.
I never know what to do in that situation.
I bet. you never know if they are the crazy type or just down on their luck.
oh just wait.. thats nothing. How long were you gone for?
It rotted in 8 days? Im pretty embarrassed. 
Oh no!  Ive had that happen before. Not at Walmart but at a dentist office. Did you make a dash out of there?
Yeah I had to tell them some might be on the chair.  It was crazy awful! Oh no ha ha. sorry that happened.
Are you going to miss him?
I like to watch movies or read a good book when I feel lonely to keep my mind busy 
Uh oh. What went wrong?
Thats too bad. Did they taste okay though?
Aw that stinks. What was wrong? Were you sick?
Wow! Thats insane! Im sorry that you had that experience! Hopefully you didnt miss too many days of work. 
Heck yeah!  I love old tv shows!  What was it?
Yeah.  Its kind of old now.  Was a really good show for its time until the RANDY DAYS
Me too. Moms are the bees knees.
My mom did too. Your mom sounds incredible.
Congrats! Im sure you will I love going to the gym. I mainly do cardio.
Defenitly! I use to run track in high school and was active duty Army so running has always been a big part of my life.
Awesome! I need to have a garage sale.
I can understand that! I dont like clutter.
Wow! Thats amazing. I remember when mine started. Its off to the races soon! 
Two words of advice... baby gates 
Aw man. Im sorry. How old did he turn?
Itll be ok. As long as both of you guys are healthy.
I sure hope so do you think he is a determined and intelligent person?
Nice you must be proud of him being your brother.
That was very nice of you. I am sure that your sister appreciated that.
Nice do you get to go the zoo any number of times you want for free?
Sounds like a dream for any animal lover! I am guessing you must be one as well!
Ewww I hope you complained so they can fix the problem! That is defenitly a health violation.
Oh okay! Hopefully it isnt a constant problem that would suck to loose your favourite resturant.
i know how you feel being young and at the beach was a fun time
you can make new memories and your kids can fondly look back at them as you do to yours
Aww thats really sweet. I understand being sentimental about that sort of stuff. Do you feel like you have to?
You should just keep it for now. He may think that stuff is corny now but later in life he will be glad you kept it.
Haha how dare you. lol just kidding. What kind?
Ooooo i understand why you did.
Oh thats awful! Will insurance cover it?
Thats terrible. I hope you can get some compensation and feel better.
Yeah not in awhile but I definitely know that feeling.  Are you having a great week?
Thats awesome I hope it stays that way!
Hey thats awesome!  Where ya going?
Yeah I havent either.  I bet its gonna be awesome.  Bring plenty of beer D
Filled up? You better clean it before it overflows!
Ew yeah definitely sounds like it needs a good cleansing!
Wowza did you call to complain?
Phone companies are notorious for this. I hope you are able to resolve.
I have had that happen to me many times.
It is definitely  a lot of work but it is the best type of work I have ever done.
That was nice of him. What idea did you have? As in how to return the favor or something?
Ohh... hah that makes more sense. Then he did his job well. Good on him. But more importantly congratulations to you for graduating! I know the feeling.. Im close to graduating myself and I can already feel the excitement. I hope no one surprises me with a party though.. too shy of a nerd for that.
Thats kind of disgusting. Im glad shes your ex. That says much more about you than her. How did you respond to it?
Oh that happened WHILE you were still dating? Man.. good call. The nerve of some people and how immature they can be. I dont get how that wouldnt make someone cringe.
They probably have to interview everyone else but it sounds promising!
I bet it is! and I am sure you ARE good enough. Plus the way I see it if one door shuts another opens you know? Keep your head up 
Aw it must so hard to let them move on to their own. 
I completely understand. My little baby just went off to college and although I miss him terribly I am also proud of him.
That sounds amazing!  Moms food is ALWAYS the best.
Wow!  That sounds like an amazing visit.  
how did they find out?
haha. has she found out yet? i bet she was mad
i would be too!
That sounds like a nightmare! Hopefully no one was hurt.
Did they take a lot of things?
That will be fun. I went for my 18th birthday and it was exciting.
Get the video It is worth it!
I completely agree. It used to be about the story line and the character development. 
I hope so too. Meanwhile you can just watch old movies.
Ah couldnt resist? Just make up and eat well tomorrow!
Yeah you should hide them at least!
Thats cool. What are you gonna eat there?
Oh sweet is it one of those where they cook it in front of you?
That is nice what happened?
That is awesome hopefully yall can continue your relationship
It must have been nerve wracking! Did you do well?
Ha! When in doubt just blame it on the microphone!
Oh gosh! That must have been embarrassing. What happened?
Thank goodness for them! Did you not study your lines enough? Or you were just too nervous?
Haha too funny! Wow 14?! Suprised you didnt learn it earlier haha 
I bet thats a great memory! lol
i agree with you there I do not trust those eastern bloc countries.
you made a wise choice not only will you not get your tshirt most likely they will steal your credit card information and use it
My husband does that all the time to! Must be a guy thing haha
Wow I hope he cleaned it up for you. I would be pissed hah I take coffee very serious.
Thats a loaded statement.. Can you unpack that for me? What are you so excited about thats coming up?
Oh right on. Do you guys not have school starting already though? Maybe you guys have kids that arent schoolaged. Anyway Ive only been a couple of times to go to Disney World. Is that where you guys are going? If so I hope you have a good time!
hahahaha thats so funny.  Did you get it out of the house?
Dang thats creative!!
Rainy days are perfect for being lazy.
That sounds relaxing.
Oh my it must have been scary for you being in an unknown area
What a good Samaritan! Be careful next time and carry a phone with you just in case. 
What car is it?
Those are nice cars but keep working it will come in due time
I agree looks like a great game to play with friends! When is it coming out?
That is actually not far! I can see what I am going to be doing over the holidays! 
Thats awesome thats a kind of woman every man needs in their life.
Im happy for you Im sure she feels the same about you!
What new job did you get?
That is great news hopefully it goes well.
Oh yeah what makes you say that?
What an incredible stroke of luck! I hope he lets you check it out really get your hands on it!
Whatd they say exactly?
What kind of hairstyle was it?
That must make you feel good. Any favorites? 
Ah yes that is a good one. Where you close with them?
i have never gone. was it really that much fun going with an ex though?
maybe i will check it out. i have heard good things about Branson
That is good then I hope they can fix it for you!!
That is really sweet. It sounds like you really love her.
It seems like you know what to do to make it work.
Oh no Im sorry that sounds awful disappointing. If its any consolation I think its easier to diet than to work out. THe old phrase cant outrun the fork.
Im sorry. What has really helped my friend has been not keeping any snacks in the house and cutting out most bread. HE really struggles with bread and sugar though.
that sounds cool they are a great vehicle
you shouldnt be it just a material object that has no lasting meaning
oh im so sorry! it hurts when our parents leave us.  my uncle who was basically my father died in april.
its ok to feel however you are feeling. its normal. you never get over it but you do learn to live with it.
Thats awful. Are you going to complain to the restaurant?
What kind of toppings did you order?
Why does baseball remind you of him?
Those must be great memories.
Prepare to spend hours on it the directions are always bad.
Yum! I had pizza as well tonight although I didnt make it.
Yes I did I need to learn how to cook one by myself!
Ugh do you know how it got there?
Oh my goodness! Do you think an intruder got in and used your house as a washroom for his dog?
Im sure you will do fine! Just be confident what is the job
Oh wow that sounds exciting! Im sure youll do great just express that passion!
Haha i am sorry to laugh. Is it an expensive window to fix.
Damn I am sorry that happenened.. did you talk to the paper boy?
Sorry to hear that. Have you tried encouraging them to play together?
Oh no is he territorial? He will warm up eventually when he realizes the cat is a family member.
Oh I am so sorry. Its OK it probably wasnt the cheetos that got him  rodents just dont have a long lifespan. I hope you feel better.
Rest in Power bubbles. You were Im sure a hamster among hamsters.
Do you think you can impress them?
I believe in you just project yourself confidently!
It definitely can be just learn to drive defensively!
You will learn with experience and Im sure you will be a great driver!
Are you prepared? Do you have all the ingredients?
Nice. I am sure it will taste great then.
Did it bring back good memories?
Sometimes its fun to look back.
I can understand your frustration.
I am sure you can find a friend to help out.
did you call your card company?
i dont blame you. that is a very annoying thing to have to deal with
Do little kids dressed as witches and ghosts frighten you?
Thats understandable. Ive always been too scared to go to a haunted house. I get spooked easily.
That is a very nice thing for him to do. Where did he pick you up?
Wow were you ok? Lucky you didnt have to go to the hospital!
Why did you give him access to your home though?
That makes sense you guys going to hangout soon?
im terrified of rollercoasters
i agree i just get on and close my eyes
Oh my I hope you werent embarrassed about it if it was a good trip?
Nice! I would love to go on trips except that my boss wouldnt like it if I did! 
Did it help you rewind the old times? 
I agree thats why I always keep my old year books around when I feel like I need a break from the present.
Oh no! Thats exciting and terrifying. Do you think it will work out?
In that case Id say you very well deserve it! I hope you get it.
Ah yea now everyone is stuck staring at there phones.
Yeah flying is the worst.
You can also have some drinks too!
Oh you left some out then? Were they worse ones?
Ah I am also guilty of that one. I believe we all are in some ways.
How come what are you doing wrong at work?
Im sorry to hear that you must be so let down.
That ig good to hear! How long have you been together?
Aww thats a significant amount of time.
I hope your dog makes a full recovery!
How exciting! Do you feel like you are ready?
It is great to be confident. I am sure you will knock the interview out of the park!
Hey thats awesome!  Any plans this weekend?
Yeah thats good that youre keeping a level head about it.  And realize that anything can happen at a moments notice.  I tend to appreciate what I have in my life as well.
Oh no that sounds terrible. Hopefully its not as bad as some of those stories I have read about where they go so far that they fake having the degree.
Oh my gosh that sounds so awful. Im sorry. Maybe you can try getting him into rehab I hear its hard for someone to stop once they start.
Your mom must be a strong woman.
That sounds so troubling.  You should get on your brothers case.
What a bummer. Did you have any sort of coverage for it? And how did you do it accidentally?
Hopefully you can get through the rough patch in the interim. 
Yeah well you only have so much time to work with. Time management is one of the most important skills you can learn.
The most important thing is to realize you need improvement. Some people like to blame everything else but themself!
Maybe you unconsciously wanted to wear it. Maybe you have some hidden desires your subconscious wanted to explore for you? What if you went and did it again the next day to see if you liked it?
Its time to go online and buy some summer dresses for yourself. Explore your femininity man. Its 2018. Anything goes. BruceCaitlyn Jenner etc. Summer isnt over. Put those hairy legs on display and strut your stuff in those dresses. Get flowery ones too!
Whoop Whoop! Thats awesome! I hope you get the job.
No problem! Is this a career like job?
What band is it?
Yeah its weird going back to college.
Oh yeah bad influences.  When I look at my student loan payments I dont miss college.
Okay so I never understood why people ate it. What is it about it that makes them want to do that? I just flicked mine. And I thought it stopped at a childs age. Really interesting.
Ive heard of oral fixations before but only in the context of like chewing fingernails and smoking cigarettes etc. But I guess if I think about it a lot of people chew fingernails and Im sure thats just as bad bacteriawise. Maybe the booger eaters are on to something.
That must have been unbearable. Did you complain to the staff about the smell?
Good I would avoid that airline too.
That is a terrible feeling. I saw a movie where a family actually left their kid at home. That would be the worst.
Well I hope everything turned out ok. Maybe you can send a friend to check your door.
Avatar the Airbender or James Cameroons Avatar?
Ah yes it has been a long time since that movie came out! It has some of the best CGI ever.
They just didnt play like a team and its no surprise that happened.
I hope so they shouldnt be getting beat like that. 
Uh I would have called the police did they have a reaon?
I wish I could relate but Ive never had to go to court. I hope it goes smoothly for you. All Ive ever heard is to dress appropriately and to speak as respectfully as you can as possible. 
I hope for your sake that you dont have to either. But this doesnt have to define you. How you respond can though. If youre mentally tough it will be a bump in the road. I guess do whatever you can to maintain healthy focus.
Haha good timing by your roommate. Does he not knock?
Hahahaa thats funny. I am sure you can install a lick pretty easily if the door is wooden.
I bet it brings back lots of great memories.
I do nit think I have heard of that game. Was it pretty popular?
How does that make you feel?
I am sorry I am sure he is just being nice for the sake of not getting in trouble!
That is always a drag. I hope it is routine and nothing serious.
Oh yeah I know what you mean about hospitals. They are always so busy and you see lots of sick people.
I totally know what you mean.
You also need some good pickup lines.
Did she ever embarass you out in public?
Yikes I hope they did not take that to heart too much...
My girls seem to like the Pokemon Go game  is this a new one?
Tell me more about it  maybe it will be something my girls will like also.
Wow! What was the dog doing or what was the show about?
Nice I love watching cute dogs doing cool things!
That is crazy how did they get separated?
Oh wow best of luck with that!
I am sure you deserve it for all the hard work you do. I will send in my recommendation.
Sure I wish there were more employees like you with such a strong work ethic.
How much money did you make with it? I assume most people would have sold before the peak out of fear of it crashing
Holy cow congratualtions that sure is smart of you!
Well still it takes bravery!
I cant believe i made this much money with bitcoin.
I am so sorry. I just recently lost my mother after years of her having alzheimers. I wish there was some way I could help you it is such a tough road.
You are completely fine needing some time. There is nothing fair about something that takes your best friend and turns them into a stranger. Be there with her but you have to take time to recharge yourself. No one can be strong all the time.
That game was suprising. The browns of all teams lol
Yea true and they used their back ups moostly. Foles is having a rough start.
What coaster did you ride?
I have never heard of that is it twisty or a big drop?
I just got done traveling myself! Theres no better feeling than the anticipating of traveling. I love airports especially because of all the peoplewatching and the general atmosphere. I hope your trip goes smoothly!
Oh gotcha. My mixup. Driving and road trips can still be just as fun. Kinda stinks if youre the only one driving but at least you can come up with games to play. Plus.. its cheaper. thats always nice.
Oh man I bet summer went by quick for you then.  Did you have fun together?
Yeah.  That sucks you guys are apart now     Id love to do a mountain trip like that though.
Itll be OK  How long does this busyness usually last for?
Oh thats not tooo bad...can you take your vacation during that time?
Why did you move?
oh well it will come!
Some people have better cards then we do in life. Its how you play your cards though.
Humans cant help that. But its what makes us strive to be better!
Why did you get a cat?
They are I hope yours behaves better in time
That is terrible I hope things get better for you both
He should be recovered by the early part of the season.
Yeah the Foles injury is more worrying.
Its hard for me to empathize since Im just in college right now. But my girlfriend is in a line of work that is the same way and I hate to see her get so stressed out and all of her time eaten away because of work. I try to give her her space and to be understanding. Hopefully people do that with you too.
Well if theres any way you can give them insight to what youre dealing with so that they better understand I would do it. My girlfriend spent 10 mins one day explaining to me what she dealt with and it went a long way for me to not bother her as much about it
I get that I have had jobs like that some people just thrive on drama they do not enjoy anything more than that
I understand that that is a great move by you do not get sucked in
Eh give him a dollar and tell him to enter the contest himself.
He doesnt sound too reasonable if you ask me.
I hate sayings but the one that goes Tough times dont last but tough people do really applies. Life is long. You have plenty of time to change your fortune and you seem self aware enough to do it. I hope you can work your way back up.
Of course but it doesnt really matter what I say or what I think. You already knew all that stuff anyway. Everyone has to have confidence in themselves. Someone elses confidence makes no difference. But as long as youre alive youve got a chance.
Why is it a great day?
Wow that is so cute I hope he gets trained quickly!
How did you break the TV?
Did your parents get mad at you?
Wow I cant even imagine. What caused the fire?
Were you home when it started?
Did you study for it?
Great then! You can ace any hard test as long as you put in the work and time! I hope you did well.
Me too! What is your favorite part?
I agree with you. I cannot wait. It is such a fun time
Cool!  What are you all gonna do? 
Thats awesome!!  I hope you have fun and be safe!
I know right some printers are just terrible.
I can feel your frustration. 
Oh wow I love thunderstorms.... though I know they make some people really uncomfortable. 
Its always good to be nice and prepared for anything. Better safe than sorry they always say. Good for you.
Wow...Are you ok?
Oh haha when you say pit bull i immediately think it could be a violent occurrence. Im glad you are ok
I hope it works out for you!
Be a gentleman and you will be golden.
Yikes!  Did you find out who it was?
Man thats awful.  Did you file a police report?
I bet you found some cool stuff
Oh wow! Those were fun. Did you play it?
I love Legos! They have gotten expensive though.
Yeah thinking about old toys makes me somewhat sad.
WOW!  All by himself in one sitting??
Are you hoping to do the same thing???!
Haha. Which one were you rooting for?
Were you disappointed that they lost?
Oh thats quite luck and fortunate for you Ive never had a lost wallet returned.
I dont blame you. 
Yuck!  I hate when friends do that!
Yeah I dont blame you.  Time to find some new friends!
Oh thats a standard prcedure. Have you ever had one?
Everything will be fine
Did you ease your nerves?
Im glad everything worked out for you!
Sometimes solitude can be a good thing. Were you hoping for company?
Call me next time and I will go with you.
have you been contacted by the IRS?
well id say no news is good news
Awwww thats so sad. Was he lost?
Good job! There need to be more people like you in this world.
American football or soccer?
Yeah I bet.  Are you a Browns fan or something?
That sounds like a bummer what brand?
Too bad you dont have a pond you can throw it into.
shees! some people just dont understand some things others just dont care to talk about
it happens everywhere. some poeple are just too dense to realize . 
Wowza...how did it go?
Oh gosh....that is embarrassing. Were you able to recover? lol
Its smart to play it safe. Sometimes we are unable to predict what other humans are capable of.
You seem very smart0
What a loyal dog! They are such good creatures. We humans dont deserve them. 
Im glad he was there to protect you! Hopefully it doesnt happen again because thats very scary. 
Did you take it back?
Dang.  Did you eat it or throw it away?
No tell me about it!
Yeah eggplant is pretty gross.
Im so sorry to hear that. It will get better though. 
Going to the gym or taking up a hobby can make you feel more confident and motivated.
Oh no! I am so sorry. was he old?
Wow! Sounds like he had a full life. You are a good pet owner.
Hey congrats!!!  Hows being a parent working
Yeah Ive always heard that about kiddos.  Congrats and good luck!  Im sure you will be an awesome parent!! D
Youre welcome.  I think I hear a baby crying.  You better go check on that D
That must be such a relief!
In a way it is actually just the beginning.
They didnt even eat it! How dare they!!
Oh what car was it?  Are you jealous?
That is a sweet ride!
thats good! how old is he?
congratulations! parenting done right!
haha.  Where they mad?  and how did you react?
Yeah I bet.  I would be too.  How embarassing 
OH NO! How so?
Haha i agree. Hopefully you can make it through it without too much anxiety.
WOW thats always a good news! i do love my pizza and  i am guessing you do too!
oh god! make sure you post a lot of pictures and give updates on the taste! you must be so excited
Nice! He must be pretty good.
Nice. You must be pretty happy for him. Will you go to his games?
What job are you starting?
Do you get a big raise too?
you know something worker1 everytime you feel good about something it always means that you did good! take for example myself when i had my job interview i also felt really good about it and guess what? I GOT THE JOB! 
thats good news indeed! i wish you the best and make sure you work hard! 
You certainly are lucky to have a dad me too!
I wish everyone was that lucky.
How much did you end up saving?
Thats amazing who did you switch too?
Oh wow.  Are you happy for him?
Yeah we all get jealous sometimes.
You are a good friend! Are you nervous?
Nice. I wish i had more friends like you.
Congratulations! What will be his name?
That is such a manly name if I ever heard one.
aww poor pupper. what happend?
good vibes going out to your good boy
AYYY thats great news! was it a calculator test? or a non calculator one
who needs a calculator with a brain like that ey? good job thats amazing news
Was she impressed?
Thats a good idea maybe take her on a cute date sometime as well?
Ouch! I am sorry to hear that!
Thats just evil no matter what the circumstances may be. Id never do that.
the best thing a human being can do
yup i love doing that what show did you end up watch?
Oh thats funny I actually just had it for lunch today. Id highly recommend it.
I think as long as you go to a trustable place not a grocery storestyle sushi joint that makes it fresh and right in front of you youll be less likely to get sick I never have.
That must have been so relaxing!
I wish summer would never end.
oh damn what ended up happening after?
what the what? why its not such a big deal it happens everyday 
Oh no what happened to your cat?
I am so sorry for your loss.
Thats awesome that you have friends that will do that for you.
Are you ok. Did you need to go to the hospital?
I have never spilled a hot drink on myself before. Weird how that happens.
Oh no that sounds like a nightmare. Did you get it back?
Ugh that makes me so angry. I hope the police can help you out in some way.
ouch thats annoying why dont you talk to him about it?
Oh really? What was it?
Thats nice. Congratulations on the gift. Its a useful one!
You must be excited have you been there before?
oh? what on earth happend ?
oh thats nothing! i thought it was something serious 
sounds like you really enjoy this game. does is seem promising?
to be completely honest with you i never played that game. but i hope it will come out soon!
oh what team? thats some very good news man! good job!
i love playing basketball especially cause i have the height advantage too 
is he okay? why did you have to do that? is he awake now?
that is so sad
Uh ohhh.  When is it gonna be your turn?!
Wonder if it would help if I call your boss and tell him to give you a raise?
I will write him a strongly worded letter!
Hey we gotta get you some money somehow!
Oh thats nice! How did that go?
Thats great! I bet he had a lot of fun too!
did you have fun? what did you eat? 
eating outside every once in a while can always be needed to change your mood  glad you had fun!
omg thats such an amazing news! good job! what is your next goal
oh my apologies i misread that one are you proud and happy for him?
WHAT! WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT 
you better be! i hope you learned your lesson though we all make mistakes but we need to learn from them 
oh really? Im not the biggest football fan
sounds like a fun time sports can get intense
I hope you do well on it.
Give it all of your best.
what what happend next? what was it? did you decide too explore this further?
omg that sounds so adventurous if i were you id ask them to take me where ever they are going cause damn anything is better than this place were living ay? 
i love cliff diving was it your first experience ? and if so how did you find it
wow thats amazing man first time for me was so amazing too and are you planning to go again?
oh damn that sucks so much i am sorry but if he is your good friend you should be happy for him maybe something better awaits you
i know you are and it takes a lot of practice to remove this feeling but its a bad feeling to have and you should look for other chances
That can be daunting. I hope you are prepared.
That will be great. Soon we will be able to call you Attorney At Law. Its so exciting.
Yeah kids grow up so fast these days.
I dont like thinking about the past for that very reason.
are you excited for this?
you should be more confident in your abilities! i am sure youll make an amazing bean dip
How exciting? What position will he be playing?
That is always so much fun and the kids love having people there to watch them. 
Me too and good luck to him.
thats good the first week is always the hardest but it gets easier and funnier as time goes by
best of luck to you! i hope everything goes well 
aww i am so sorry for your lost i know this is a very hard time for you
i am sorry again what are you hoping to do now? 
were you in a hurry to be somewhere?
hmmm but why did you go 1 mile over
Wow how long ago was that? I wish it still was.
Id definitely agree to that. Better times.
Oh cool! Which one did you get?
Wow I just got the NES one.  They are so nostalgic.
aww thats so sweet of you to do did she enjoy that?
even the smallest things can make the biggest different in the world! she is lucky to have a person like you
i did also . it was fun
yes. the good ol days
That is the confidence to have!
I hope you ace that test!
oh really? care to tell me what on earth happend?

damn any plans for next week?
buying newspaper? 21st century? sold out? whatt thats a first for me here they practically give it away for free and we still have many more left maybe you can use your phone or tablet to view it? 
oh man dont worry if you google free coupoins there are bunch! thats what i do
ah the good ol high hopes go watch a movie come out disappointed i totally get ya man what movie? 
oh yes! the meg my colleague from work was disapointed beyond repair he was telling us all not to watch it i guess in a sense i am lucky
I think thats a wonderful attitude to have!
I hope they are as well. I do love some fishing.
Oh my what did you see?  A mess I presume?
Oh no that is definitely something you dont want to be surprised by.
what happend? tell me
thats sad news i am sorry for this news you must have been extra drained after coming back from work from that news
Im sorry who was Stefan?
Oh okay now I know.  Yeah that was tragic.
yikes that pretty bad
Oh no that is horrible! Did you call the police?
Thats good. Im sorry that terrible thing happened to you.
oh man. i dont like the dentist . is it a normal cleaning and check up or something more?
well that sounds good hopefully there wont be a lot of pain.
itll be fine. dont worry.
why did you do that? wasnt there a toilet or something?
that mustve been embarrassing. you shouldve went to the toilet.
oh what went wrong?
thats a fuckin bummer hope you left her
Its always great to have friends that are willing to help out when you need them the most.
When are you expecting to move?
thats sounds horrifying
hopefully nothing too bad happened
Ah that sucks. Did they have a good reason to do so?
Yes I would be too. Id let my friend know that I dont appreciate being treated that way.
Were you able to replace it before he found out?
I think that would be the best option.  Nothing worse to be thirsty and have your taste buds set on something and its not there.
Ah yes do other members cause some trouble for you?
That is indeed frustrating. A little appreciation and recognition is what they need to give you I think.
why did you have to send it back? what happend
good thing you returned it! rare or whatever they call it meat is actually very dangerous for you espcially coming from a restaurant good thing you did that!
not cool! i love monsters! i hate when my girlfriend takes the last one
that is good to hear!
What kind is it?  I have a bad one too by the way.
Are you going to be on the news when you win??
Yeah!  When you win I get first crack at your autograph!
thats nice to hear
oh really? I just had some myself today love sushi
That sounds like it was a gross situation. I bet it has hard to clean.
It can always happen with pets and it is a drag to clean I know. My dog has done it more than once.
How did you do on your test?  Did you find out?
What course did you test for?
im glad thats the case
oh god thats annoying the same thing happned to me for my iphone case they got me the smaller one isntead of the normal big size one so annoyed
ayyy thats a win isnt it? but still annoying but  at least you getting it for free now
sounds like youre going on vacation!
where are you going? i havent taken a vacation in a long time
grandmas food always brings back memories for some reasons they taste very nostalgic.
it was so simple back then right? not having to worry about anything but enjoying life.
oh really? thats very coincidental because my son also started football this year are you happy?
i know! they grow so fast and i didnt think id use that overly used word but god its so true
Oh thats awful!  Maybe you can try to return it and say it came like that LOL
Its a little funny
Thats great! It feels good when you can get a little back from the things you have invested so much in!
Definitely! Plus gets some of the clutter out of your home I guess to make room for more.
WHAT WAS THE SHOCK?
oh my god! thats so bad what did you do ?
Why?  What is going on?
Sounds like you need a vacation
what makes you think so? im pretty sure you arent.
that doesnt make you a failure! you are doing more than enough and im pretty sure she appreciate every single thing youre doing for her.
Oh wow!  Congrats!!  What are you hoping for?
That is so awesome!  How old are they?
its always good to get away and reset
did you make a check list and double check it?
Im sorry?  What happened?
Thats awful.  I hate when that happens. 
really? like how? what she do?
dont worry with people like this karma hits them very very hard and they get what they deserve 
Were you driving or walking?
I hope they caught the person who almost hit you. That kind of incident can leave you traumatized for a long time.
oof thats not a fun siutation
thats a vivid description haha
thats nice wanna share this wonderful experience with me?
wow! that is such a wonderful thing to do indeed! i am proud of you
Thats amazing! I do not so far but i hope to some day.
Thanks! I appreciate it. I am really happy for you though! Thats one of the best things to feel in life I am sure.
Oh wow that must have been scary!  Im terrified of snakes!
The only time Ive seen one up close is when a professional was handling one.  I prefer to keep a distance.
did you call the police? or did you do what needed to be done?
well  glad it wasnt something important. it was just a cat. and you are safe. so that is great!
What if what?  What has you so fearful?
Maybe a career in astrophysics is in your future?
wow! thats amazing what did she do?
oh god yes they grow so fast next thing you know shes taking care of you and you are all old haha its so wonderful
Thats great! Is there a particular reason or just in general?
thats so great! cONGRATS!
Any particular reason that made you do that?
Right well we can all get that way sometimes. Id just tell your friend directly that you werent feeling up to it.
thats really nice
sushi is the best
Is there no way to get in touch with anyone?
Why are you alone in a room? Do you need me to come over?
really? why is that?
wow! that is next level smartness and thinking! good job
i am lucky to have someone like my fiancee too! what makes you so grateful about your fiancee
its probably the best feeling on earth right?
thats super cool
thats impressive good luck to her
I cant wait either I am looking forward to it as well.  Do you know when the release date is?
CoD 4 comes out in about two weeks I think.
i agree. everyone seems to be out for themself and do not care to help other or take others into consideration
yeah its a tought thing to have to deal with
oh god! how much did he rip you off by?
oh so what are you going to do about this?
this happens a lot at work maybe try to talk to them about it? 
i agree everyone is just selfcentered and its very annoying to communicate with those people.
How do you feel about it? Ready?
Just do your best you can and that way you wont have any regrets no matter what the result is.
yea i know that feel its the same for me right now
You must really trust them. I hope it turned out well.
Now you know who to call when you want to go away again.
Oh yeah my brother would always get some things I wanted too. Made me feel jealous. 
Thats even worse. Well I hope you at least got to ride it when she wasnt looking!
oh wow that sounds nice
i just did last week actually
oh no! why didnt you do anything about it?
snitch? is that actually still a thing?
oh wow! what was the discovery?
mind. blown. that sounds breath taking
oh god! that must have been so scary 
oh god! just hand them what they want its not worth your life
wow thats very faithful of you
not really but i can respect it
awww thats so sweet of them are you guys close?
thats so nice are you looking forward to uni?
yep almost everyday because of my fiancee. what about you?
i know theres nothing like true love .
As in a grade?
That can happen sometimes even when you are prepared. Its like test anxiety. Has it happened before?
How did you end up doing?
How well? Im proud of you for that my man.
what? what did you do
thats so nice! good thing you do we need more people like you all these normies nowadays just sleeping around and only chasing after cannibalistic desires  
You must be upset are you okay do you need any help?
oh did it go well?
huh sounds quite intimate
Are you nervous of meeting new friends?
I think you should look to join a club in school!
yes! i live about 30 mins away from the coast . i love going at night
yes i love when the water is flat and its just a glassy reflection. i also love when the water is rough and loug
aww thats so nice! did you have the biggest smile on your face
that makes me so happy! you blessed my day! i cant wait to see my son do that too
why was he beating you?
oh what an abusive person how did yo ustop him?
Im sorry to hear that can you make it up to them?
You should try to reach out to them.
i hope it wasnt an important and you still managed to pass everything. why did that happen?
dont worry about it maybe it was the teachers fault . but since youre okay and everything is fine theres no point in worrying about it.
Tell me what has you so worked up?
I am so sorry. I know right now your mind is spinning and everything is chaotic. You need to sit somewhere and let your mind settle down.
Thats a good idea what do you need to buy?
Thats smart I love a big turkey dinner the family will be pleased I bet.
What did you decide to do instead?
Thats lucky of you do you plan on being a pharmacy tech?
what else would you do if you didnt go?
that sounds like good money
Did you try going to any clubs to meet anyone?
You should consider trying to network though its worth it.
thats nice of you
why does it creep you out? i think its pretty good
you could always try sushi bowls. 
why is that? what happend?
its okay! if you really want to do it you will do it strength isnt all physical your real strength is the will to do! if you have that the 15 push ups can be turned to 100!
Just once. If the car had not died I would have hit a building.
I know that feeling for sure. I freaked out because I could not remember how to use the brake. 
Did you make it home in time?
That is so lame what caused you to be so late? Just the lights?
awww thats so sweet i aspire to be like you with my fiance i will sooon get married! what re you guys planning to do? and whats your guys secret for holding a relationship for so long?
i know she is the one we are identical in every way i am the only person who understands her and she is the only one who understands me we communicate about everything and we are both non normies!
what did he won? were you hoping for some help?
its insane how people can be so selfish once they see money een your own father becomes a monster. dont let it bother you.
yikes! thats a load to clean isnt it?
i know! my cats are a hell to take care of as well one always poops in the kitchen while the other one chases off my pigeons its really annoying
what letter? please share this experience with me
oh wow! that is such good news! i am so happy for you what are you going to study there?
wow thats so motivating to hear what inspires you to become a police officer
yeah i hope you be one of the good cops not like the current ones
did you just move back?
i miss waking up to my moms big breakfasts. i actually live a block away from her
What kind of restaurant was it?
I do love a good burrito I should go check it out some time.
go on! tell me about it lets hear it
thats so disgusting you are disgusting
how long did you have your dog for? that mustve been very painful losing a pet is always hard
thats a lot of time. you could say he was part of your family. 
With those kind of people you just have to be blunt. If that doesnt work then its time to excuse yourself from the conversation.
You are usually left with no other option.
were they good memories?
yes i love that feeling
Oh Im sorry to hear that! I know how hard that can be to lose a loved pet.
Well I hope you feel better soon!
How exciting! What is he planning on doing next?
Thats impressive is he hoping to play professionally?
fun jobs with good pay do exist
that does make sense
Oh its crazy what some people will try. But sometimes an argument can get very interesting to watch!
I dont really blame the driver. Plus thats annoying delay in everybodys busy day.
I understand! I felt the same when my son left its seems so much less noise and talk.
A good friend is hard to find.
Do you have a best friend?
How long have you been friends?
Yeah but we arent as close as we used to be.
yes. this situation happened every friends relation.due to this we are in relation with a family members
dont worry all the friends are came to you be happy
yes one friend
2 years later i spoke to him
that could def be an improvemnt. what kind did you have in mind
good choices. which are you leaning towards?
Was it a suprise?
Where is he living now? Have you heard from him at least?
i really do hate that stuff
its a sick sad world
I know you have really been looking forward to this. Where did you decide on going?
My niece went there and loved it. Are you flying in or taking a cruise?
Were you able to return it?
Does it fit. Id just have them send me a new one when it comes back in stock. Its their mistake.
did he go home with you?
boo. poor pupper
Oh no! Well it happens sometimes we get so busy and dont notice. 
Life gets us out of whack dont feel bad. Im sure you can pay for it next time.
thats fantastic! It certainly is a great feeling financial freedom!
Thats so great!
left until what?
that sounds like a lot of fun
What was sketchy about it?
Yikes.  Did you end up placing the order?
What was it it?
You cant be serious.
You definitely made my day.
Well good luck with whatever is out there.
Are you currently saving up?
I bet.  How far south of the continent are you?
Cool.  I have a friend that lives in Brazil
Thats awesome!!  Tell Gabi I said hi when you go D
Thats a good thing. Lying to the police opens a whole world of trouble.
Especially if it involves going to jail.
How did you cut your hand?
Did you lose any fingers?
Did you get hurt doing the robbery?
How long ago did this occur?
Are you going because someone else wants to or was it something that you wanted to do?
If you dont have any choice then I suggest you bring earplugs.
Oh no did people look at you judgingly?
Well you can learn from it and be better for it.
Whow! That is one mean car!   What did your friend say?
That must be quite exciting to drive around in those supercars!
That is great. What are you studying?
Whats the distance?
How does one prepare for a marathon? By running? 
What kind of feelings?
More than anything?! More than cats?? You must really love her!
I hope you didnt listen to them.
Nice you must do whatever you want each day.
Hopefully all of your hard work will pay off and you will do well.
All you can do is do your best and whatever happens after that at least you will know that you gave it your all.
I understand. Did you finally took them skating?
I understand. Those things happened.
Did you run into any problems?
Thats a lot of questions. How did the rest of the trip turn out?
Is it your first time there?
I do love a good beach I was just in the Philippines and they have some of the best beaches Ive ever seen.
That was nice of you. Is she still alive?
Sorry about her death. At least you enjoyed your time with her.
How that happened?
Maybe your cat started a family somewhere in nature
Do you know who stole it?
Maybe it will turn up who knows.
Are you playing?
I understand. What is the name of your team?
WHat kind of car is it?
That is one awesome car!  Dont be too jealous!  Just start saving your money!
Wow. That sounds exciting. You should do fine.
What kind of motorcycle did you buy?
About to what happened?
Is your name Kim by any chance?
Uhoh.  Im assuming it was not safely returned to you?
Fanny packs for the win!
Yes but that is how it goes sometimes.
All you can do it work hard and try to make more money.
That is great. Are you working?
Is it a little bit complicated to have two jobs?
You are wonderful just the way you are! Be happy that you are alive and healthy and beautiful! I am sure your brother wishes he could have something of yours too.
It is all in your head. What makes you think being tall is any funner? 
I hope you had insurance.
Sure it must be a real pain to be in your imaginary shoes.
Oh I hope nothing bad came from that?
Yeah that can be stressful.
Thats really hard to do. I should do the same thing but I still start my day with a big glass of iced coffee every day. It could help though.
I can imagine. That is really great that you are able to follow his advice and maybe each day will get a little bit better. Anxiety is the worst!
Good luck. What class?
Sometime you got to pay for quality.
Hopefully you can save up and get a pair.
I hope you did. Is it one that you really wanted ?
Patience paid off for you then hopefully.
I am sorry to hear that. I am sure you be fine.
We all go through tough times. It will work out for you in the end.
Wow what a thrilling sport. Yeah I sure hope he knows what hes doing. You life depends on it!
You are certainly brave my friend. I dont have the guts to ever do that! Be safe!
Why cant you play? That must be very disappointing.
Ouch! Im so sorry. How long until you can play again?
haha why did you go on?  peer pressure?
That makes sense!  I bet it didnt go as bad as you think!
Is that good or bad?
Maybe you should child proof the house.
I know. Those were the days. 
I liked going to Blockbuster picking out movies.
That sucks did the house get any damage?
That is good at least you were prepared.
Thats great hope you get it! But seems you have much on your plate already.
Oh I see well that sounds better for sure. Good luck and I hope you will get it.
Oh no. Do you have a plan B ?
Think of it this way. If you had waited you wouldnt have been able to get the house. Dig in and fight too keep it.
That is no good!  Why have you been feeling so sad and depressed?
Wow!  That does sound like a lot of misfortune!  Just try your best to think positive if you can.  You never know what the future has in store for you!
That must have been so cool to drive around in a ferrari. Was it fun?
I bet. What color Ferrari do you have? Be careful not to drive to fast now
Oh no! He doesnt seem like such a good friend then. I hate it when friends pull stuff like that!
That sucks! He definitely appears he was trying to avoid you. Well one day he will need something and you can give him a taste of his own medicine. lol 
That is terrible. Did you call the police?
I understand. I hate when that happened.
That is so scary. Did he destroy anything?
I would have been too. Was there more than one?
Most people do not possess those qualities these days.  That is quite honorable of you.  Being faithful is quite important!
You should be.  I am sure your family appreciates it as well!
I understand my parents are 85 and 88 both with dementia.
Im glad its that way for you. My parents destroyed my life intentionally years ago.
Nice! Sounds like you will be successful then! I think you will do great!
Hahaha nerds are cool these days havent you heard? Sounds like you are on the road to success!
That must be very difficult to have to wait for results. I hope they come back and everything is fine though.
Yes that is not fun at all. Ive been there and its hard not to think about anything else. I really wish you the very best
Thats so great!  You seem quite content.
Thats so cool.  I think I would feel the same way except I was dumb in my 20s and still have student debt!  lol
Thats interesting.  Why on Earth would she want it back?
That is crazy!  There has to be an explaination!
Im in that boat right now too. I feel its going to be a long time coming.
I hope you can hang on for something better.
I dont have any kids. I want to adopt one day.
Yeah it was fun...and so free.
I lived in an apartment complex and there was a pool so I loved swimming.
There is nothing better than being content.
That makes you feel safe.
Oh yikes! That is a scary thing to witness. It is good to be safe these days with so many people using phones while driving and even walking. It is dangerous out there and you never know what can happen to you at any moment.
Yes be safe my friend! I am sure you will because of your hands on experience with what you saw.
Thats not good!  Have you considered going to rehab?
Maybe a different facility could help?  Addiction isnt something you can deal with by yourself. 
What did you? Did you return to the store?
Did you have any money bet on it ?
Well then it wasnt too bad.
Not quite sure I get what youre saying. Lost as in missing?
Wow. Sorry to hear. I dont know too much about dementia. 
Oh it happens to the best of us. I have done the same a gazillion times! It doesnt get any better or funnier lol.
Oh well just know that everybody in the world has fallen a few times. The most important thing is you just get up and keeping walking. 
Was it a large one ?
That is great. Is it a big one?
Wow. It is a great raise. Your employer should have impressed by you.
Oh wow that is absolutely terrible! I can imagine it was horrifying for you.
Was he dead or just injured badly? I wouldnt be sure what to really do either. 
Uh oh! That is not a good sign! Do you think they are going to call it quits?
It is good to have these kinds of keep sakes. Maybe the rings can even be used again in a family wedding.
that sounds like it is going to be a super trip youll have a blast
Boston is a great place to visit makes sure you have some chowdah  
Yes death is always a tough thing to deal with especially when they are close like parents. But that life and every single person on this planet will have to deal with that at some point in life. It is just the nature of life.
Oh what a bad pain to carry. I hope that you are happy though. Your parents will want you to always stay happy.They are in a better place now.
Oh how cute! I love animals especially puppies!
Oh yuck! They will do that but sure dont want puppy kisses later.
Thats good. I know its very expensive to replace that part so Im sure you are relieved.
Yes for sure! I always prefer repairs over replacement if possible.
That would make me nervous! you never know what kind of person it could be a predator perhaps.
That is always a great feeling! I love gardening! What did you plant?
Oh yum!! That should grow nicely this time of year. You should definitely can all the extra tomatoes you get this year. It will be great in winter soups and stews. 
I am sorry to hear about all the layoffs.  I will pray for you at Church for you to keep your job.  What do you do for work?
How long have you been an accountant?
The weather is terrible here also. I hate that. Are you on the east side of America?
That is bad. What are you planning to do the rest of the day?
Oh that is a tough period. Poor baby! But with mammas love everything is alright. You are such a great mother!
Yeah hopefully they have invented something that helps with the pain for the teething. Hopefully is is natural.
Oh no! Thats terrible. What made you choose that stock and what will you do now?
Youll earn it all back dont worry. For next time though dont listen to people who know nothing.
Thats great! Did you win your fight.
Congrats! You trained for it so you deserved to win!
Thats great! I love soccer. I grew up in Scotland where everyones golf and soccer crazy. How old is your son?
I bet that makes you so proud. Perhaps hell become a professional soccer player one day!
Oh no!! I hope it wasnt coffee! Yes that is pretty embarrassing. People probably thought you peed your pants.
Oh well hopefully you learned some kind of lesson from this and it wont happen again.
Oh yeah. Was the food good? What about the service?
Oh my gosh! What where they serving? That makes me feel sick for you. I hate being decieved!
I hate aggressive drivers. They cause the majority of the accidents.
He probably had no where to go important. He was just being rude.
That sounds like fun. What were you taking pictures of? I didnt know film existed anymore lol
Do you take pictures professionally or just a hobby?
First Im sorry for your heartbreak but second... its okay to be alone to let the feelings pass. How long has it been? 
sounds like its time to get out and start doing something to take your mind off from it. maybe fitness? 
That is great. What is it a big amount that you had to pay back?
I hate having debts. 
Awe that is a very good friend to have. You are very lucky to have a friend like that. Hopefully you are there for him too. 
Count your lucky stars my friend! Bless you heart!
Thats great. It really feels great when we accomplish something and reach our goals.
I hope you do as well that will be a big step towards a great career.
That was nice of you. I hope she gave it back to you when you needed to use it yourself.
That is very kind of you. There needs to be more people like you in the world!
And did he pull through?
I love it whern
Did you all have a good time there?
Haha! Rollercoasters are an exhilarating experience! I love riding them at amusement parks.
Oh my...You have to be careful when you use the internet for school assignments.
I know someone else that happened to. I wouldnt take anymore chances either.
Weekends are beautiful if you dont work on them and have nothing to do!
Enjoy the weekend as much as you can for me I work all day today!
That sounds very scary what happened? 
Smart move honestly better to be with a larger group than to be alone. Glad you are ok. 
How are you still friends?
I have a few friends who are way better off than I am. It makes me a bit sad about my situation. 
Thats cool! Maybe he will be the Magic Johnson of the family. Hey you never know!
Yeah all you can do is encourage and support him. I hope everything works out and that he becomes rich and famous someday! 
Its great looking through old photo albums and remembering all those great times.
Yeah it really is. We just slap everything on our computer or online these days. Its just not the same.
Hey it happens to the best of us. Were you able to clean it up well?
Oh no thats awful! I hadnt realized it was carpet. As a clumsy person that couldve definitely been me in your situation so I get it.
Thats great to hear. Was it a boy or a girl?
Children are so amazing and life changing. I hope your sister is ready for all the challenges that awake her.
Oh really?! What did they find?
Oh yuck!!! That is terrible! I have heard of people getting really sick from this black mold in the house. What are you going to do?
I hate spiders. There is nothing worse than waking up and seeing one above you on the ceiling as you are laying in bed.
Well that sounds terrible. It is time to burn your house down and start a new life elsewhere.
And how did you feel about taking another persons forgotten belongings?
Thats a good way of seeing it I suppose.
sounds like it going to be an interesting trip
i can imaging the anticipation but before you know it youll be on the beach
Congratulations! I fail to see the relevance between having a good grade and shopping however. Are you being rewarded for your grades?
Oh definitely! I hope your shopping day exceeds your expectations!
Was he using it or something? Why did you think it was him and how did you find out it was you?
You have a secret spot for your headphones. Are they super expensive? 
I have zero kids. I break stuff all the time. 
No just ridiculously careless.
Ive never been there. I think it would be intimidating.
My dad and uncle actually went camping down there. You go with a guide and you set up camp in a few different places.
Im the same but I think in a place like the grand canyon its really dangerous to try to go down there alone.
Yes I know I wouldnt mind riding the donkey or mule down there.
Good luck. I hope you do really well during the interview.
It sounds like the job is a great fit for you. I really hope you get it.
Oh no thats terrible! Did you end up finding her purse?
Im so sorry to hear that. Hopefully your niece feels better now and hasnt lost too much.
Oh dear. I am so sorry that happened to you. Were you hurt?
That must have been terrifying. I am glad that you are okay.
That is so annoying. Did you need it for a special occasion?
I hope they at least gave you your money back.
Sorry to hear that. I lost both my grandparents in the same year.
From what year?
I know what you mean. Me too! What was your favorite part about the 90s?
How come? Is your sister a minor and are you an adult?
That doesnt sound fair at all I wonder why she did that.
If I were you I would ask your mom why she paid for your sisters items and not yours. Thats so mean.
Now that I think of it it most likely is the reason why maybe she doesnt even think of it as a mean act and maybe means no harm by it. Regardless it is important to share how youre feeling with her.
That could be creepy depending on the person. Im extra paranoid though.
Thats understandable theres just no way to be sure what a strangers intentions are.
Thats great! Consistency is key!
And youre building trust with your dog as well! Its a winwin. 
Kids like touching and looking at things Im sure no real harm was done. People like making a big deal out of everything.
Id say ignore them as best as you can. Its normal for kids to do these kind of things!
I am happy for you. How did it feel
That sounds like a great experience
I am usually that way whenever I have a doctors appointment. I hope everything went well.
Ah. There you go so you were worried about nothing. I am glad that all was well.
Oh thats a shame  cookings such fun. Why did you stop cooking?
Gosh I couldnt afford to do that! Its far cheaper for me to cook up a big pot of stew or something and freeze it for busy days.
That stuffs hard to come by! Its so easy to chuck stuff in a pot and then go watch tv or do something else for a couple of hours. Tastes better too!
I wish I had a slow cooker. Or one of those Instant Pots everyones raving about.
Its weird the way some things from our past seem so timeless. Its nice you had a good experience seeing your school. 
Our past can be a great source of strength and comfort. 
Would you be able to go meet him instead?
That sucks. I would be disappointed also. Hopefully yall can make some time soon to get together.
Did you get any news back?
I hope you do get the job you deserve it!
sorry to here that it must be tough for you at this moment
but as time passes you will find another and be cheerful as ever.
Oh my dad loves football too. I bet you have some great memories.
Did you and your dad ever play football together?
Do you have a patio or backyard to do that in?
I am so jealous of you then ha
You must have been really prepared to be so certain of achieving a perfect score!
I hope you do get that perfect score you deserve it after all!
That is really neat do you have a kid?
I would go atleast you would get cake
Wow! Is that old for an iguana? Im sorry to hear that
My daughter wants an iguana. I am scared of animals 
She is . She may be able to handle it on her own. Thanks for the info
That can be frustrating. Did you do anything to help?
Oh that is terrible cashiers should have more patience.
Was the cake that good or were you trying to make him angry?
Maybe you could make it up to him. Im sure hell get over it though. 
I guess he really need it. Did you give him the money? 
Well at least you gave him something. He could buy a burger at McDonalds
Did she end up being able to go?
Well I hope she is able to attend if not you know its nothing personal!
I dislike people who do that. I never understood why! Have you tried talking to him?
Oh I believe you. Typically those type of people arent people you can reason with.
I do that sometimes to you memories are always nice
I look forward to that when I have a kid
Thats nice. I wish my brothers did that for me.
What kind of event is it?
Ohh fun I love the artistic nature of some. My daughter just got a tattoo in honor of me.
That happened to me once. It was terrifying. Were you okay?
That is true. We dont get a lot of snow here. I dont think anyone knows how to deal with it
Wow that is unfortunate I hope you are okay financially...
What did he get you instead?
Thats not ok I have been in that situation before and have made my girlfriend a card wrote her a poem something. 
That is not cool at all. Why would he say that? Maybe he misplaced it.
That must have made you feel angry. I am sorry that happened to you but please forgive him.
I love good books what was it about?
That sounds really deep and dramatic I think I would like that one. You might like books like The Deep End of the Ocean also.
I love sitting on the porch when the weather is nice.
Where I live it was really nice too. There was a cool breeze and no mosquitoes out.
I imagine that would be a bit unnerving. It being dark and anything being possible.
That sounds creepy I would have to start keeping protection with me just in case.
Did she accept? Im sure you would be great to go out with.
Im sorry to hear that. Im sure you will find someone who feels the same about you.
My parents are no longer living
Its okay I have good memories
really me going to get relax by having beer
yeahwell i am not a reader but i love to play video games so much 
That is good is he struggling now?
Did you ask him about it or did he make a big change to high school. Sometimes a big change or just burn out can kick in.
I know the feeling. Did a lot of people see?
Love is a great thing for sure
Uh oh. Do you think it is something major?
Well I hope it isnt too expensive. Maybe it will be a smaller issue.
Thats fantastic! Hopefully youll hear something about it soon. 
Im sure you did. Think positive!
How old was it ?
Thats terrible. Im so sorry. Youll never forget him.
I am so sorry. I hope you can make friends try to join some sort of activities to meet people.
Are you a browns fan ?
I see well then Im sorry that worked out wrong for you.
What problems do you need to handle?
I got you well I hope that you get to that position at some point soon!
I do understand what you are saying. There are good cops and bad cops.
And sometimes it has to do with race it is really a sad situation.
Damn that sucks.  Well at least you can get a fresh pair
That sounds so fun! I always wanted to get a tattoo!
I know. I have a friend who has both arms covered.
That sounds so good
Its nice to be alone sometimes
Has he been sick?
I hope he is okay. 
Those are pretty nice trucks 
What kind of business is it
I might need to apply then!
I love buffets. What kind of food did they have?
It happens to the best of us. At least you were able to get more since it was a buffet.
Happens to the best of us
There are still some nice people left.
That is the best way to feel during an interview. Im sure you did a good job.
Ill keep my fingers crossed for you.
That sounds so fun
Wow! How traumatizing! Were you scared at that time? 
Oh man I think your mother regretted that after knowing she almost hurt her family. That is quite awful to think about.
Thats cool.  What was the last thing they did for you
Wow thats pretty aweseome...you must have put in a lot of hard work to earn it
I suppose that is true to an extent that makes sense
congratulations. sounds like you aced it
i bet you will make a great bartender maybe one of these days you will hook me up with a free drink
Thats terrible!  I cant imagine how hard that is.
Thats very sweet of you.  Shes going to need her friends to help her through this!
That is awesome! How much did you win?
That is absolutely amazing! Lucky you
Aw Im sorry to hear that. I bet you have a lot of good memories.
I remember my dad watching football so much as a kid. I used to get so bored.
Did it hurt though
I am sorry I would cuss too if it happened to me
Aw thats cute. FathersonFatherdaughter bonding moments are something I miss out on.
It sounds like you and your father got along well and that isnt always the case in families. Im happy to hear that.
That is so scary. I dont know what I would have done
You did the right thing. I wouldnt have been able to stop thinking about it.
That must be a wonderful feeling now you are on your own.
Ah so you are now a loner you should try to make friends.
 yeah I got to a few places like that
Oh awesome! What are the tickets for?
That will be fun.
Oh that sounds dramatic. How did it turn out?
Im glad you worked it out!
A new job can be a little nerve wracking. Did it get better once you settled in?
Thats great. It sound like its really working out for you. 
I wish I was that lucky! I always lose.
That is worse. I would have been so jealous and annoyed.
That sucks. Did you have a hard time with it?
Maybe you can get a tutor this time.
You could always start saving now
You can if you want
That is great!  Are you really excited?
I hope your date goes well!  Stay optimistic and positive!
Awesome! you are extremely lucky. Will you be bringing anyone with you.
Duh! You better I do hope you have a whale of a time. I would be elated.
Wow that is a predicament 
That was probably a good idea
Oh my gosh! That is so funny. Was he really embarrassed?
I can understand that. But its still really funny. My husband is the one to get more embarrassed over things like that.
Awww! Sounds like youre a great parent!
I hope I can be a mom someday!
Well I hope it works out for you!
I am glad you met someone.
Everyone needs close friends to talk to and hangout with.
Did they knock and leave?
You should put a camera there. You can see it from your phone.
Are you excited or dreading it?
Good for you. I hope you get a good start.
awesome whens the first date?
Aweomse always great to see people forming new relationships.
Ouch! Did you trip over a cord?
Oh yeah? Im guessing youre not a big fan of roller coasters?
Aww Im sorry you didnt like it. Roller coasters can be pretty scary even for people like me who enjoy them.
Thats great!  Did you win it on a table game or at a machine?
Did you stop playing after that or did you try to win more?
I understand.  I play every now and again and I usually quit while Im ahead.  It always ends up that Im waiting on my friends to lose all their money so we can go home!
Yeah  the first time I went with friends I won 100 bucks but ended up giving it back to the casino.  I told myself that if I won money like that again Id just stop and take the money home.  It works out well!
Does he do that often that is not ok
Yeah that is really not ok
Oh wow. I have never done that
Well that is great. I think people get upset over other people actions when it comes to facebook.
What kind of puppy did you get?
Those are big right?
Accidents happen. Are you feeling better.
I heard that was going around.
Yikes.  Im sorry to hear.  Will there be other chances available for promotion?
Id be pretty upset too.  Did anyone give a reason why your coworker was chosen over you?
What is dove season?
Oh!  I didnt know people hunted them!  What is used to hunt them?  Shotguns?
You sound confident. What subject is the class? 
Awesome. Im sure youll do well then.
That is so nice you must be really looking forward to that. Will you be traveling alone?
Make sure you take lots of pictures and prepare for the weather.
You must have been really scare!  Could you sleep after that?
I imagine  I am easily scared with these kind of movies so I dont watch them much.
Thats cool whats your favorite part about it
Nice youre never too old to go trick or treating haha
Were you competing?
Thats too bad. What do you do now?
How did you like it?
Great!  A new look can certainly help feel refreshed at leas it does it for me.
Are you planning to attend?
You are a loyal friend. I do hope your friend will learn from his mistakes.
Yes i have that one friend and you dont want to give up on him. I hope he gets it together soon
Thats cool. What kind of benefits
Thats great. Do they offer dental and vision
Bahamas is a nice Caribbean island you must be really looking forward to it.
I can just imagine make sure you take lots of pictures and dress for the weather. It will be hot. 
That was so nice of him!
You are lucky to have a nice dad.
what did you end up doing?
Oh well I hope it works out well for you!
Im so sorry to hear that. Death is never easy to deal with.
I hope all your family was doing well.
How odd. Sounds like a scam.
Did you look into the situation further? Did you call your phone company and see what they had to say about it?
Thats a good thing. A lot of people like me! hatehated it. Shell do so much better if shes happy.
How old is she? Is she studying something she can use later in life?
Oh well goodness encourage her! The sooner she starts learning to love to learn the more joy shell get out of it!
No it certainly isnt! Hopefully shell keep loving it and will love learning for the rest of her life. Think what a gift that must be!
Thats a good idea. Its best to be prepared for a dangerous weather situation as you never know when it can happen.
Yes as a wife and mother I know I usually look to my husband for guidance and strength in situations like that!
I feel sure as well you are clearly determined and intentional.
Thats the beauty of it I feel motivated now so I need to keep an eye out on my local job market.
Pros and Cons.  Those systems are abuse prone but some people need them.
It can be infuriating.  For example over a 3 year period in my own state there was about 20 million dollars worth of food stamps spent in major vacation hot spots florida hawaii california virgin islands
Why didnt you go
Or it could be you and a dope house party
That should be an awesome feeling. I do wish you all the best in life.
Youre welcome! you have your whole life ahead of you you are a star.
How come? What do your brothers do to annoy you?
I hope they dont do it on purpose to annoy you!
That is terrible. Did the police find them?
I hate that people do things like that.
I love eating at casinos. They have some of the best food.
Did you win anything?
Yeah it happens my little bro drives me crazy sometimes
Same here how old is your little bro?
Wow I am so sorry to hear that my grandmother passed from cancer about 10 years ago
I get that I will pray for her best of luck friend
That is nice. You must have a nice body and I am glad that you feel better about yourself.
True if one is not happy about something the best thing is to switch things up.
Sorry to hear that RIP
Do you have any other pets
That is awesome! What all do you have going on?
That is great you are very lucky and blessed!
Wow what are you going to do?
I would maybe hit him or get revenge at least
Was she upset!
What will you get her?
What sport is that?  Sorry but I dont know anything about it.
Ok sorry I didnt know.  I hope the play better next time!
Oh my gosh. I am not surprised they denied any wrong doing. I think that is typical of mechanics. What do you plan to do about it?
I think bad reviews are important though. A lot of people use those to determine where they go for service. You may save someone else the trouble you have.
That sounds great!  Have you not seen them in a while?
It will be good to catch up with them!  Family is all that matters.
Im looking forward to it too! I remember playing Smash on the N64. I loved it.
Sweet. I hope to meet you on the battlefield someday!
You sound excited? do you do it up big?
What are you going to do this year?
Thats an interesting theme.  Are you going to make the costumes your self?
That sounds like lots of fun!  
What do you hunt?
I didnt even know there was a dove season. I actually never even went camping before
I want to some day.
that is good I am glad you can trust him like that!
That is awesome I am glad you have that type of relationship!
Wow that is great!  You must have been very excited and grateful!
I hope you enjoy your card very much!
Congratulations! It always warms my heart to hear about a happy loyal companionship.
Well it has been for three years so thats a great sign!
I cant say Im a huge fan of fried chicken. Did you enjoy it at least?
Ew thats gross! Cant you get sick from partially cooked chicken?
Oh wow that must have been lovely. How was it living in paradise?
Well I hope for you that one day you can. Maybe retirement! Man that would be amazing.
I could not agree more with you. but it seems like a lot of politicians either dont care or are not putting enough resources into combating climate change.
If all people do is pray then certainly nothing will change. Its time to start acting instead of wishing for things to change if we want to our children and grandchildren to see a future.
Aww that is sweet are you going?
Aww well do what you think is best
Well I would go on the date then buy the kid a big present.
Awww. I remember that feeling with my first kid
it is. just wait until he says dada you will melt lol
What movie do you plan to watch?
Oh Ive seen that it is not too bad! I had fun watching it.
I used to love them. I cant believe that are still performing
I thought they were so much better that nsync too lol
i hate when someone does that it can be so annoying 
no need to go that far just make sure your friend has not seen the movie before and go out and enjoy it.
that is true that is lame though
Its always good to have solid family members.  Not everyone has that.
Thats good to hear.  
I bet you hate having to leave and I am sure she misses you.
You must be proud of her. That is great.
She must have a lot of faith in you.
Ouch! I hope he was okay!
Are your not liking your new job?
Thats no good. What are you going to do?
I am sorry you are feeling lonely.   Why dont you see your friends much anymore are you all to busy
Yes I know what you mean  That has happened to me too.
Wow what kind of toys did you find
THe nostalgia must have been so good!
Nice! Would you like to send the cleaning fairy round to my place?!
What a wonderful daughter you have. She has a very good heart. Youve obviously been an excellent parent!
Definitely both of you  Maybe go to an ice cream parlor or a spa?
Or even do both! Is your daughter in school?
Oh wow that must be exciting! Is this your first home?
I hope you do too. I will definitely throw in a prayer or two that you do!
Does it still work?
Nice. I love finding old stuff from my childhood.
Thats pretty rude.  Are you going to buy him some more beer.
Man.. Im glad youre not my roommate.
Dang it must have been embarrassing 
You are exactly like me. Those were the good old days
My youngests are 3 and 4 now. Those days are gone
That sounds exciting! are you nervous?
That is true  but you will meet new people and learn a lot!
Congratulations!! How did it feel when you found out?
How cool! Congrats again on your new addition Ill keep you in my thoughts and pray you get some sleep in the next 12 months haha
That is great news!  You must be really proud of him!
That is good positive reinforcement!  Congrats to your kid!
Okay I am sorry that it was not up to your standard. I have not seen it as yet.
Okay I understand. I am thinking of watching it.
Oh no. How long was the power out for?
That sounds awful!
How does that make you feel
Well I wish you the best of luck.  If youre hardworking then youll make it
Oh cool!  I bet its also nice not having a boss breathing down your neck right?
I have been in the past.  Right now Im part time with some work at homestuff.  So yeah I do remember liking not having a boss the most!
Well thats a good present! Im sure you are excited to get it.
Thats right you do. I have a hard time doing that myself and should realize I deserve it as well too.
That sounds horrible!  Good thing you are all right and only walked away with a little shame!
Thats good.  It could have been a lot worse!
I would be too haha...whos fault was it
How old is your kid
Thats cool that youre active.  Does she go to college or what
Gotcha.  I make sure to call my mom at least twice a week Im 26 and Ive got my own apartment as well
Thats really awesome Im happy for your success and encourage you to enjoy yourself.
So far so good just trying to stay cool. Good conversations are helping.
That is wonderful news. That is a lot of money to win. I am happy for you.
Oh yes you can relax a bit and pay some bills.
Amazing. Those things seem to never pay out. That is a lot.
I know that feeling. Did you treat yourself after winning?
Im a Boston boy but I gotta give em props
People hate on Brady cuz hes been gold since day 1.  But the Eagles came ready on defense thats for sure
That is good that is what we hit the gym for right?
I do I have been trying to bulkup I am 64 190 and need some more on my frame
That could be awkward. I wonder what made him feel he could do that?
Hopefully he got the point and wont ask again.
I am happy that you reached home safely. You have to be very careful when traveling at nights.
We are living in a cruel world I am just happy that you are fine.
I know the feeling my little nephew used to beat me at Mortal Kombat constantly just by button smashing. How did your little brother get so good at Wii?
Ahhh! Well at least you found out it was just user error and not that he was actually better than you!
Nothing wrong with being emotional. Its healthy. I get a bit emotional about that stuff too. Family and friends are extremely important.
If they dont thats their loss. My family are so important to me  I love them dearly. The same goes for my close friends. Dont listen to other people  theyre the ones missing out!
He must trust you a lot.
I hope you guys have fun
That is nice. we are suppose to trust our spouses.
I know one has to earn trust.
That is a lot of kids imagine raising that many kids!
wow that is huge they must have abosrbed kids from another duck or something
I am so very sorry for your loss.  I lost my mom last year.
It is a very long process but it is true that time does help a tiny bit.
OH no. Were you still at subway?
I know the feeling. Its hard to work when you are hungry.
I bet you were embarassed
What happened? You had too many bills to pay.
Haha. well at least you treated yourself now you are broke.
Yes you will be looking cute and get a lot of attention
Now youre talking. That would be nice 
What is wakeboard. That sounds a bit scary.
 I bet it is i am afraid of water I cannot swim so i know for a fact I would not be trying that. I hope you have fun.
That no good!  How long will he be gone?
Just hold on a little longer!  You will feel better when he gets back!
Thats great. Hopefully they eat a lot of food!
I am sure they will have a great time
You must be very proud of yourself. I am proud of you. You are a star.
So you really surprised yourself. I guess you studied hard.
Sometimes it just takes a time and you need to stay proactive. I know it can be disappointing. 
Just keep a budget and stay strict. It will gradually get better.
I think I have seen that movie
I like animated movies. I have lots of kids lol
Do you miss your family
Nice Im in TX and my fams in MN.  I try to visit them at least once a year
Oh how exciting! How did she do?
Amazing you must feel really proud!
Congrats! How exciting!
Good luck! I am sure it will be fine.
Ohh man I am so sorry.  I have had that happen to me many times over the last five years.  Did you contact your landlord?
It is wonderful that you have family that can help.  Are you going to be OK going forward?
That was really nice of you!  You must have a really caring heart!
That cat will love you forever!
I have never been on a roller coaster. I would be very scared too.
Hahaha you are going to scream I hope you dont puke. It should be fun though.
Awww that is so sweet. Did he go to a good home?
That is good to hear. I hope he lives a good life.
How are you feeling about it?  Are you sad?
I am sorry about it did she move close by or to another town?
I bet you will be balling. I hope you remember the poorer folks like me.
That sounds grand  its a deal I am rooting for you.
And what movie did you guys see
Wow that must have been a while back...do you still keep in touch with these friends
Good luck! I am sure that it will go well.
I hope you find out soon.
Oh my gosh.  I am so sorry.  What happened?
Oh no.  Poor thing!  Hope you are hanging in there.
That is good reading always relaxes me too.
Yes curling up in bed with those things can relax you like nothing else!
That is exciting!   How long will it take before they give you and answer?
I hope everything goes great and you get your new home!
Ah a Patriots fan. Sorry about that but theyve been so great in the past you should feel pride in that.
He really is a talented player I must admit.
How was that experience for you
You must have been proud.  But she wouldnt be there if you didnt persistently push her to do her best
I am glad to hear that. It can take a lot for some people to be confident like that. I am glad you got over your issues with it.
Yeah I know exactly what you mean. 
Ive had that happen before.  Its like they are trying to become professionals at it. Was it a whopper?
I think they would lie sooner if they could.  My kid told me flat out that her brother did something when it was impossible that he couldve so I knew instantly.  Its humorous while theyre young watching them get into such a deep hole.
Are you going to have a surprise party?
I know that is hard but its alright if you do it for the right reasons.  You all will be able to laugh about it when its all over.  Have fun!
Oh geez I know how that is. How long do you think it had been that way?
Thats pretty interesting. Well I hope you get that all sorted out!
Wow good for you finding the courage to overcome your fear! I can understand why you were nervous after what you went through.
I completely understand. Your parents sound like great people.
That is great.  Do you still swim?
Well you can start slowly Im sure you will find your motivation again
That is so exciting! I love babies. Do you know what his name will be?
Thats a neat way to decide on a name. We picked our kids names months in advance. Luckily their names fit them well. 
Soooo how was it?
Oh no haha. Im guessing you at least had to be polite and pretend like you didnt want to puke?
Crazy was it like the movies?
Reminds me of that Eddie Murphy movie!
Lmao sounds like a confident dude
Or hes looking for his soulmate
I hear you.  I still love the McNuggets but I never eat them since I went Vegan.
Its the best  but it is hard to give up the delicious fried meats though.  
Oh my goodness!  What happened?!
I bet you and your date were shaken up!
Did you crash!?
I am so sorry that happened to you! 
That stinks.  I always feel left out when that happens to me.  Even more so when I know the people from my best friends work so when I cant be involved its hard.  How do you feel about it?
Im sorry.  Make sure to reach out to her and tell her how you feel.  If shes a good friend shell understand and make an effort to make time for you but dont let it make you bitter.
How terrifying!  Did the intruder took anything or was he just some kind of creep?
That is so awful.  I imagine you wont feel safe again until you get the alarm.  You can also get a big dog to help you keep safe.
Oh man that would have freaked me out what did you do?
It seems your daughter may over exaggerate things a little bit.
Why did you do it?  Do you now feel bad about it?
Well maybe you can tell your friend and ask himher to forgive you.
Well if you trained as hard as you stated I am sure you will do great!
Sounds like a great plan. Good luck!
Thats whats up!
Keep it up. Failure is for dweebs.
Ouch that sounds so painful!  No I have never have them.  Do you know you can avoid them in the future?
That is great that your wife took such great care of you!   I hope you are now feeling completely recovered.
Oh really?  Was something wrong?  
I can understand your feelings but I suspect you made the right decision.  Maybe it is something you can talk with your friend about.  A good friend will understand.
Oh no! Did you find out who?
You should look for camera in the area they could help you catch the perp.
What are you getting certified for?  It seem that you were weel prepared.
That is great.  I wish you the best of luck!
Thats cool.  Was he better than Cris Angel
What kind of tricks did he do
Congratulations! It takes a lot of courage to move away from home like that.
Its great that youre so positive about life.
Oh you are such a great wife! I think he will totally appreciate it! Are you doing anything nice for him?
Oh sounds very romantic! Have fun my friend!
Oh no. Are you scared at all?
Well if you do decide to go through with it I wish you the best and quick healing!
Oh my what did you have surgery for?
Thats really nice! I hope you recover really quick!
Great! Im sure youve prepared a lot for it. Good luck!
Im sure youll do well.
Oh how exciting! I love the beach! Are you bringing lots of snacks and drinks?
Oh yes dont forget the sun block. Very important! Well I hope you all have fun out there! I am jealous!
They must have tasted good!
Lesson learned thats for sure
Guess youre just going to have to evacuate or something!
Better not go on any planes!
Oh no! I hate when things like that happen. You can sometimes still get it if you try to speak to the manager
Yea...sometimes gym managers tend not to be there which is a pain. I hope it works out for you though!
You must feel awful about it!  What are you going to do?  Are you telling your friend?
Yes I believe it is better.  I hope your friend understand.
That sounds sad.  What are you getting distracted from?
Well that sounds admirable.  Focusing on making money so you can be independent.  
haha oh man did the owner get mad...or did he just laugh it off
That is awesome. What changed?
Can fat really turn into muscles? Asking for myself? lol 
I rented a Corolla once.  It had great responsiveness was speeding like a mofo 
Im more of a Honda guy tbh.  My Civic lasted me a 21hr nonstop drive from MN to South TX and she still runs good as new
Gross!  That must have been disgusting!
That is true!  way to look at the bright side!
How scary!   Thank god nothing bad happened after all. 
That is the important thing  I always keep reminding myself to focus while driving too.
True you must be feeling nostalgic kids going back to school and all
Someone needs to invent a time machine!
that is awesome. i too have had the same issues.
i wouldnt eat until 11 am and then stop eating by 9pm
its not as hard as i thought it would be. certainly helps with staying within a certain amount of calories per daay.
Aww whys that? Do you live in an older home?
Hey dont worry about what other people think! As long as you have a safe roof over your head and your family is happy thats all that matters!
Oh no.  Did they do damage or steal anything?
That is definitely scary.  I dont understand why people want to steal from others.  Get a dang job!
Was that for work?
Im sure you are going to do great.  I really hope you do get a better paying job as a result.  Good luck!
Oh that sucks! How far do you live from the venue?
Sorry you missed the concert. That is a bummer! But it came with some perks I guess. You met a girl!
What a nice story and how wonderful to feel so protected!
Yes I am sure that have make you or will make you in the future a wonderful parent too!
Oh no! I hope that you get well soon and that the tests come back okay!
Me too! Im not sure what you might be going through but do consider making sure youre eating a good amount of fruits and veggies. Herbs too theyre all healing and helpful to the body.
Good to hear coffee is the bomb!
So much winning but with coffee it never gets old
Did she forgive you?
That mustve been funny
Jeeze I hope he really had to go otherwise he must have been slacking off on purpose!
Well thats good at least he didnt do it on purpose. Otherwise I would have found a way to get back at him. Maybe laxatives to make him REALLY go!
Oh congratulations! Thats awesome. Whens the wedding?
I can imagine. Now you have to get planning the wedding. Should be fun
That was very careless of him Im sorry.
Maybe you should talk with him and let him know how serious of an issue it is to you.
Sorry to hear that Im glad you were prepared.
You did the right thing. You should always stay ready for a disaster.
Cool what did you study?
Nice I bet you cant wait to graduate.
Those are such high payments be sure to get your plan based on your income it really helps.
Yes the US takes advantage of the need for education. I hope you find a job you love and dont forget that they have lots of payment options.
Oh that sounds mean.  How did you do?
Are you two still going out?
Well that was terrible of you. Why would you do that?
Wow.... I certainly hope so.
Ouch Ive done that before. But how sweet of him sounds like a keeper.
Ah so he had ulterior motives and wanted the chores done! Just kidding. Glad youre feeling better.
Oh no! Did they help you find another homelet you stay with them for a while?
That is so great! Its good to know that there are still good people in this world
I love those. That must have brought up some nice memories.
Oh I see. Are you far from home?
Congrats! Did he choose wisely?
Well you did say it was one you really wanted. How nice of him to do that for you.
Oh that must be heartbreaking for you. Do you know where he is?
That would be the best birthday present ever! I know hell make every effort possible to be with you.
I am so sorry to hear that. That kind of news is always hard to receive.
They have all kinds of treatments for cancer now. He should have a fighting chance.
Sorry to hear that. What happened to him?
Oh that is a nice surprise. I bet you caught up with each other.
Jeez wonder why they left it there for that long?
Who knows thats a waste of a good sandwich though!
That must make you angry. Can you report him?
I understand. Hopefully he fixes it for you.
No way!! Are you ok?
Did they take anything valuable?
Every found out why they didnt show up?
Well thats understandable. Hope you had a great party afterwards!
That must be amazing! I wish I had your job
It would make me feel amazing to see their face!
Oh that is cool! I bet you are proud.
It is paying off. That is such a fun age.
Oh no. That sounds annoying. Know whats causing it?
Hopefully you have insurance?
Thats unfortunate. A hit and run is terrible
I hope things look better. My friend dealt with a similar issue
Thats unfortuante. I bet he is good now
What university or college?
Oh how exciting! Are you at all worried how theyll take being separated?
Definitely. It will probably be tougher on you than him. Heres to a wonderful first day of preschool for both of you!
I am so sorry. That is horrible. Now what?
That must be so difficult. I hope all turns out well.
Awesome. That is a huge accomplishment.
You must be very proud. Cant wait to see what he does next.
Wow! That is amazing
I have never had that happen to me
Thats disgusting! Hopefully you got a refund or your food recooked?
Good I bet you were mad. At least they made it right though.
Well hopefully you will see them again soon. Im sure they will.
You must find joy in your life  something you are passionate about
You must be anxious and excited! Was it expected?
Hope everything goes as planned!
That is so sad. Did you find out who did it?
I feel so sorry for you. I love my pets too.
How exciting! What kind of car is it?
Oh sounds nice. Hopefully he doesnt have any accidents in it.
Where will the show be?
that sounds amazing! check out the french quarter while you are there.
I love the weather that time of the year. I agree it is so much fun.
That is awesome. I love all the food and time off.
You sound like a great uncle!  You must be proud of him!
That is great that you are there to help him out!
i hate to ask why you walked back out
gross i dont blame you public restrooms are always disgusting
Ooh fun! Has it been long since the last time you saw them?
That will be nice to have some time to catch up. Have fun!
Yes I love big trips. I spend hours packing!
Thats awesome! Congratulations.
Thats great. You have quite the household it seems!
Thats unfortunate. Sometimes used cars can be tough to deal with
I hope not. I have a feeling things will get better
Oh no! I have had that happen to me before too.
Good I would have too!
Im sure youll do great! Have you been preparing?
Good luck! dont be nervous. Im sure youll knock it out of the park!
Congratulations!  Thats awful!  DO they not have kids themselves?  Its a pretty typical thing to happen when youre the first to have a baby among them and they dont understand that lifestyle. Ive been there.
Im so sorry. My sister was in the very same situation as you and I can tell you she made it through and her daughter is 9 now.  She kept taking a day at a time and working hard and went back to school to become a nurse. You can do it to. Find some true friends who will support you no matter what. 
I am so sorry to hear this. I am sure you will find another job but it doesnt make it any less painful.
Just have faith I am sure it will all turn out!
Thats sounds like a lovely night. I bet it was wonderful
I love the guitar too! Thats marvelous

Thats exciting! I wish you the best of luck!

Oh thank goodness! I hate hearing people losing their pets.
Thats awesome. Where to?
I hope you have a splendid time! That might be great
That is bittersweet! What is his name?
That is a unique name I have 3 sons myself.
I would have been scared too! Was it by fault or was someone attempting to break in?
Mine did that too. We had to replace the motion sensor.
thats great! what is llws?
thats great! my kids played baseball
How exciting! What is it?
Omg! That really is the best birthday present ever!
That must have been really exciting.  Did you think you had lost it?
Were you really close to her?
Thats unfortunate. You will get the next one I am sure.
I bet your employer still knows how much you have put in
That sounds fun! Has it been a while since you seen your family?
I am glad you are getting to see them!
Are you a nurse?
That is awesome! My sister is a CNA now but in school to become a nurse. Have you worked in any other settings as a nurse?
A new mom? Good question maybe offer to mow their lawn? I dont really know haha
Welcome and yeah I always disliked mowing the lawn!
Im glad. You seem very happy

I think I heard about them in the news.
Im so sorry. I recently just lost both of my grandparents within a year. I know how you feel.
It really is. Getting older is not fun.
Oh my gosh! Me too. It literally makes my skin crawl. 
I agree. I avoid going to stores during busy times because I just cant handle being around so many people.
Oh no! Spaghetti sauce is so tough to get out
Lol i am sorry about that! hopefully you can get it out
Me too. It is a huge pet peeve of mine.
Right? Get out of the way!
Was you way down yonder on the Chattahoochee?
Hmmm... Not as interesting
Oh man I HATE waiting on test results! Gets my anxiety to extreme levels.
Well Im glad to hear you have a clean bill of health!
Life is not fair for anybody

Sheesh that is terrible. I would have a hard time not leaving
Well hopefully something else will come up for you!
That sure do how old is your son?
That is so exciting.. enjoy this time with him.
I love eating out at a restaurant with great food! Too bad its too expensive to go every night!
Yeah I enjoy cooking but it can be so time consuming.
I would have shot back that is uncalled for
Maybe you should cut his brakes
That sounds really cool.  Is her Blog very popular?
Oh my goodness!  That is so awesome.  I would love to be able to do something like that.
Thats one of my biggest regrets was not investing in it. Now the value has skyrocketed. 
I didnt know that. I guess not.
that is bad how did it happen 
what happened afterwards 
What did he do
Oh my! That is horrible!
Oh wow! I guess he didnt care!
That is the truth no shame in his game.
Interesting... what are you going for?
That is awesome good luck
I do too! I always make my husband kill them.
I dont blame you! Get them all!
That is awesome. I hope he says yes!
Well I wish both of you years of happiness together!
Probably didnt last too long when you got back though Im guessing
It happens Im sure they dont blame you!
Does that mean what I think it means?  have you had a juicy flatulence experience? 
I wonder if there is anything you can do about that.
Oh my that is horrible i hope you find it!
Man there are some crappy people in the world
Did they get caught?
Did they take anything important?
What were the leftovers?
I enjoy fried rice! I hope she wasnt too upset.
Nice what did you do with it?
Haha yeah I guess you cant really return it at that point
Any big plans? My son just turned 4. Ive been nostalgic also.
That sounds fun! have you been looking at the old baby pictures?
That is a very nice thing to do! I am a big animal lover. 
Me either. It breaks my heart. 
I am so glad to hearit. Whats going right in your life?
Oh no was you able to get pregnant?
Congrats! Are you still pregnant?
What band? That was very thoughtful or her. 
Awesome I hope you have a great time at the concert. 
Do you think you have a good shot?
Is the interview soon? Good luck.
Wow where did he get it from?
Thats awesome glad hes able to hand it down to the next generation
Oh man that is so scary. Did they steal anything?
Were you in the house?
That is awesome! I am happy for you!
That is what is most important!
Thats funny its like you can see your kids and see yourself experiencing it when you were a kid
Right its hard to imagine there was a time before you when youre little
That sounds nice! Im sure they appreciate it a lot.
I bet! Good bonding time. How old is your son?
Wow how exciting! what do you do?
If you put forth the effort im sure you will
Im sorry. Your boss still knows about the great work you have put in though
Yes you will! Thats a great attitude
Wow thats actually hilarious. And very unfortunate
Wow thats even funnier... But even more unfortunate
Oh no. Was it deadly?
That is rough. I am glad you made it through.
Are you nervous? Im sure youll do great if you prepared.
Good luck! Im sure youll ace it!
I find myself not finishing potatoes either! They take so long to cook
Right taste good too
I could only dream of having that. That must be nice.
I wish my company would allow me to do that.
That is faithful you are a good dude
That is good they are hard to find
Oh no! Were you alone?
She must be a party animal.
Fluff that stinks did you shoot em?
sheesh what a bummer!
I do not like scary! I try to stay away from scary movies too!
It sounds like you had a good time though.
How fast were you going?
Wow I got a ticket the other day going 70 in a 55. I was late for work
Nice hope you have fun!!
Im sure itll go swimmingly
Who is your team.
That is good. what is going on with it?
That is good i hope it stays that way
Ive been wanting a jeep for myself too! They are so cool
I agree! They look cool and are fun to play in the mud with
Nice must have been shopping with his wife.
Macho man lol 
Thats funny likes its an extension as who they are as a person
I see yeah sometimes you just gotta lead by example
Man that was super lucky most people would have taken it
Exactly it doesnt happen very often 
Really? I dont watch much football
I like soccer
that was very nice of them. you werent able to walk into an office and get it faster
oh then that makes sense. good thing they were willing to help
Wow. Twins. How rare is it to have them?
Man. Thats very interesting. Were you at all surprised to have twins then?
Ive never tried that do you bet money on it?
Nice hope it goes well
Slammed as in he got really drunk or slammed as in he got into a fight?
Its been a while since Ive seen someone drunk
that is strange i would have got out of there
I would be a little spooked out by being alone
That stinks did you go anyway?
Yeah they are but so good
That is awesome.  Is it with the same company or someone different?
I hope you get it!  When will you find out?
Cool what did you do about it?
Little bugger maybe next time
Which movie did you see?
I watched parts of it too. I didnt think it was that great either.
what is coop?
Oh that is really neat! i hope they like it
Did you do or say anything?
Sometimes you got to setp in and say something though when you know something is not right.
Were you legit sick?
Lol that happens to the best of us dont feel bad
Wow that is impressive. Do you work with him?
That is still not bad!
Nice!  Hope something horrible didnt happen to you just to get it.  You getting a lot?
Wow!  That seems worth it!!!!  Wish it had happened to me! ha ha.  Hope youre healthy still and congratulations!
That is awesome! What breed?
Oh ok that is very nice of you 
Thats pretty scary.  Was it like a scene from taken?
That sounds pretty awful. no thanks.
Oh that is irritating sometime! That happens to me sometimes
Lol. I am guilty of hiding a couple of snacks for myself at times nothing wrong with that
How did that go? 
No way! I can not stand when people do shady things like that. We you able to get your stuff back? Did he get in trouble?
Yeah I would have been mad too. If he needed something he should have at least asked. Stealing is never okay.
Wow that is odd is there nothing you can do about it?
That is insane i hope everything works out!
That sounds like a win!  Did she get mad?
This just happened?  Oh boy!  maybe you can replace it before she gets up.
Thats awesome. I hope you dont spend it all too quickly.
Make sure the consultant doesnt try to rip you off either haha.
I hated chemistry in school i hope you do well
It is a difficult subject no doubt
Thats a good idea. Hopefully you had enough room
Thats good news. I bet it was fun!
Mmm pizza sounds good. Whats keeping you from ordering pizza yourself? Why let him have all the fun?
Go for it! Youll only regret the pizzas you dont eat!
Dang traffic must be intense in your area
True driving takes more focus than a lot of people can handle
whos birthday is it?
Do you feel bad about it?
You should make it up to that person.
Oh I do not like spiders either!  What did you do?
Id probably have done the exact same thing  then called for my husband or one of my daughters to kill it!!
Oh no!  Were you able to take care of him with medicine or treatments?
Im so sorry!  I know how hard it is to lose a pet!  I hope you are not sad for too long.  It sounds like you did everything you could to give it a great life. 
Thats good to hear one of the best advantages you can have in life
And theyre all you got in the end!
Whoa did you find out what it was?
I dont blame you i would have been terrified 
It can be boring to drink at the bar by yourself.
That must be a cool bar to let pets in.
I have a problem getting rid of things too. Sometimes you just have to throw it away or donate it.
Just leave the house and have someone trash it for you.
Glad I could help.
Oh no. I am so sorry to hear that. Were you close with this coworker?
Than I completely understand that would be so hard
That would even make it worse. Did it happen all of a sudden?
I am so sorry for the loss. Good friends are so hard to come by
Nice its like little kids can learn anything!
Thats awesome hope he goes far
Oh gosh! are you ok?
Haha thats a good name. Were you able to see it vividly?
Ouch what a jerk. Why did he do that?
Oh I hope you punched him back.
Oh no! Was you at least at home when that happened?
I bet that was embarrassing. Was you drunk?
Im so sorry i can not immagine that
I can agree with that adulting sucks
i miss them as well
Oh theyre in your bubble. that stinks some people are weird like that no bounderies.
I truly do feel bad that you have to endure that. My girlfriend and I were just talking about how horrible shes going to feel when she loses her Havanese pup at some point in the distant future since shes so close to her. I hope you can grieve the loss of your great friend in a healthy way.
I can appreciate why theyd say that. They just want you to feel better. But its all about to how youre feeling. Youll know in your gut when to get another pet if you ever want to get another one. Its important to take the time to reflect on your lost relationship.
Thats wonderful! Youre right it is so rewarding to stand back and see everything clean once you are done.
Right thats something you can at least have full control over. Your own humble abode.
Was your landlord truly trying their best or did they simply not care about your wellbeing at that time?
Im so sorry to hear that. Some people are just cruel to others that are not within their social circle.
ugh. People like that are gross.
I know right. Some people are too lazy.
Wow I envy you. That sounds like a wonderful feeling!
Thank you! I hope to feel that content someday!
I didnt think that was possible for a dog on a walk! What kind of dog do you have?
Thats quite the mix! Whats his name?
Funny you say that... my roommate just got a cat about a month ago. I was hesitant to agree to share the apartment with it as Im not the most fond of them. But I didnt want to say no. Its actually been an affectionate cat so far.
I suppose so. Ive never gravitated towards them. They seem like they only have one personality and theyre either nice or mean and never warm up to you over time. So I was a little wary of that.
What kind of hobby do you have?
That is awesome!  What kind of boats do you make?
That sounds like an ugly scene...did anybody step in
For real? haha good job!
That is awesome! i am happy for you!
i agree totally it takes a strong person to admit they are like that
What kind of trouble is he having right now?
Oh no. That is no good! It is hard to sit back and watch someone have a drug problem
Good job. That can be really tough to go through that.
You are a good friend though. I wish i had more friends like you.
Theyll understand sometimes its better not to overextend yourself
Better to rest so you can do everything you want tomorrow!
Yes I love it here. It is the greatest country in the world.
That is how I feel about it. I love my country.
Dear lord how old are you?
I was joking. I havent a curfew since I was 17. Im an only child so wouldnt know much about favorites.
O no did you report it to the hospital
That is not ok I would make go to a higher up
You want to start school back up?  What are you going for?
I bet that is a lot of work!  Do you already teach?
Oh yes! I know your feeling. I see my dog as a child as well.
Right! Its like some kind of spiritual bond I think. Its a wonderful love to have!
Thats touching how is it these days?
Right change is often difficuly
Yeah I see no harm in that
Yeah i know i dont get why people are that way
That would be great. Good luck.
I really hope you get it. Just stay confident.
Congratulations! Im so happy to hear that. You must be really excited!
Holy moly ravioli. 27 million? You are rolling in the money.
that isnt good were they true?
That is terrible is there someone above him you can go to?
Are you going to watch?
No I am not a big fan. Which team do you like?
How did he get hurt?
That happened to me a few weeks ago. I was severely dehydrated and I fainted. I hit the ground hard.
I am now. Had to get stitched up.
Oh dang. Do you think it was intentional?
Oh that stinks. I bet you were pretty mad?
Oh no what did you buy?
Was it at least Budweiser?
Sorry to hear that. Do you think it was an intruder or just some prankster? 
Did they take your television? 
What stops you from going? Being busy with life or just deep down you just do not want to go
Sometimes life does have away with getting away from us
Life is good when its like that
Cherish those moments
I dont blame you I would have eaten some. Did they notice?
What type of candy was it? I like Sour Patch and chocolates.
Good taste in candy! I love Reeses cups and Hershey bars. Did you eat any of those?
What the heck is there?
School can be al ot of work
I say go for it
Im sure shell be flattered if youre honest about how youre feeling!
I see I hope it goes well for you!
what do you mean i think it is pretty good right now
Yeah it always foes in the end
That is terrible i hope everything is ok
Thats got to be annoying! Have you tried telling him to stop?
Maybe he should take up knittingor something else that would be a bit more quiet.
Ah that is disgusting!
Same here. Are you living on a street where it is normal as far as crime?
Dang that is pretty scary though.
Yeah when I was younger I did some of that stuff as well. Its a really embarrassing thing to hear stories about things you did that you dont remember doing.
Well if you have never gotten blind drunk and strip naked you havent lived.
Oooh like what kind of toys?
Wow that sounds like fun.I love canoeing!
You ever think about moving?
Hope everything works out for you!
Aww how long have you been together?
Thats amazing keep up the good work!
Why did you steal stuff?
Oh that is rude did you pay him back?
Nice! I wish I was more active in searching for scholarships like it sounds like you are. But this one sounds like it was a lot of hard work to earn. I havent been the smartest about lightening the student loan debt burden while in school. Good on you for looking ahead.
Sometimes compromises have to be made. But I have to say Im impressed that you were that selfaware about the entire process especially as a somewhat new adult. Good for you for considering all the options and making the choice you felt was best. You sound like youll be successful after college especially because of how hardworking you are.
Nothing like a deep clean to breathe new life into your home! Its a great idea to get it out of the way now so it wont me on your mind once things start to get busy. 
I completely understand that. Its a good quality to have and is actually healthier in the long run if you keep your surroundings clean.
Someone broke in?
Good thinking.  Sounds like you should get yourself a new house
I agree such helicopter parents exercise far too much control on their kids doing more harm than good in the long run.
I completely agree. Unfortunately we also have to clean up the mess made by our parent generation.. you know like climate change exists! 
What kind of belt does he have?
Heh. Thats really cool. I need to take self defense classes.
Oh man i am jealous. Are you going with anyone?
Dang are you scared at all? As far as doing it yourself?
Did you tell him he ate it in his sleep
I hope it tasted good!
Why are you having to go again?
Probably from the crazy weather change. I hope they figure out what is causing the cough
Oh no. Well I hope that makes him better
I am sure he will be fine
I am happy for you. Just keep going
That is a good thing ha
Thats great.  I dont have any tattoos myself but a lot of people I know do.  And it seems expensive.  So Im glad hes not charging you much. 
It seems that a decent one is several hundred dollars.  I just dont have that kind of money.
I hope so too. Heart conditions can be scary! Do you have anyone closer to her that could check in?
I know quite a few people that live their lives that way. I can see some of the reasons why a person would think that  but its still difficult when it comes to the health of someone you love.
What is deserved or undeserved? 
I see dont worry though. Nowadays everyone finds an excuse to grab their pitchfork and point it at someone.   
Thats good timing at least. Glad it didnt take too long.
What ended up being the problem ?
She sounds like a great girl. I am sure it will you sound like a happy couple.
Hell yea you sound like a genuine guygirl. You know what is important you will do fine.
Why would your uncle be upset? And how do you feel about the situation? It sounds like theres a lot to unpack there.
I see. Well whats most important is your reaction and feelings around the situation and what you plan to do about it. The only one that can affect the outcome is you. Its disappointing to deal with your uncles negativity but you cant let it distract you from moving in a positive direction.
Thats great when life just feels right
I hope they do too! Im happy for you
You must be feeling nostalgic maybe your kids will enjoy them
Right its amazing how one thing can bring back so many memories
Wow that was super nice of him. You are lucky to have such a great dad.
That is a really great thing to hear. I hope you can find some way to pay back his kindness.
yeah but that is his ob
yeah im not sure i could every take that job
That sounds like an uncomfortable situation. What ended up happening? I kind of avoid large crowds and sports events because of this since theres usually alcohol involved.
Oh so you got involved? Were you trying to protect the kid? If so I can understand that and thats noble. Hopefully nothing too negative came from the situation.
Yikes thats very disrespectful. I hope you told him how you feel about that.
Thats good at least he learned from that. I hope you guys are going strong now!
Did your boyfriend notice?
Lol. Sometimes we got to do what we gotta do
Did he! You lucky dog!
Well dang that is awesome man hopefully you can save up for your own lambo.
Were you actually under the influence?
Well thats great of her weve all done stuff.
That sucks Im sorry to hear it. Did they at least ask you first?
At least they asked you thats good. It will pass in no time and youll be hanging soon Im sure
Dang I guess she wasnt your friend after all
It is glad you could figure out that shes not right to have in your life
Oh no did you get into trouble with your boss?
Ahh thats too bad. Just make sure to take responsibility and be very sorry for your actions maybe it wont be so bad.
I get that nothing can beat home!
I am sorry to hear that well maybe when you retire!
A good dentist is great to have!
Did you have a lot of work done?
what were the left overs?
That sounds good!
Sounds like quite the adventure you had. You must feel proud of yourself. 
Yes and hopefully no one was hurt. 
Nice you must feel pretty lucky
Haha I wouldnt either if I had a Porsche....sounds like you need some kind of bomb shelter emergency parking
Are you happy with it
I am glad for you then
A couch! how was it hurting you?
Haha no worries. I though how could a couch could be scary... Are you OK? did you go to the doctor?
Oh no! It happens to the best of us.
Luckily it is in the past and I am sure no one remembers it!
Thats good to hear! What makes him so awesome?
Im happy hes able to support his family through his work. I hope he enjoys it!
Gross!  I would have been super mad if my cat did that!  What did you do?
Yeah I would have done the some.  Hopefully that never happens to you again.
Oh no maybe try going to reddit and ask people what to do in your city!
Hahaha me too its such a time sink. This week when it was down for a couple hours I really felt like I had nothing else to browse.
Uh oh! How was it driving weird?
Yikes! My old Ford Focus had a similar issue. It turned out to be really bad alignment and ended up putting a hole in our front tire. 
Oh yeah?  You applying to a new job?  
Oh how cool!  Well good luck my friend!!! What do you want to study?
What does it not do right?
Thats so lame you should maybe tell your boss about it though.
Oh wow that isnt good.  Hopefully you had good insurance and that you are ok!
Is the kid ok?  He wont have his license for a few more years probably now.
So exciting! Do you have any special gift in mind for them? 
Thats alright. As long as you two are happy with each other thats the most important thing!
I hope you dont feel jealous of your friend. Did he accept the job?
Seems like you have a trustworthy friend for life! I hope you cherish this friendship.
Dont you just hate that?!
Just remember it is probably a female mosquito.  They are the ones interested in your blood.  Not the males.  
Sorry to hear that but why did you distance yourself from your friends?
Good job for realizing that because such people are a bad influence. Join some outdoor or interest clubs and you might just find new friends. 
Yea i would be too! That is a horrible person.
Aww im sorry. Maybe enjoy a glass of wine and watch some girly shows. My husband is in the military and gone a lot so I feel for you.
Aww thank you means a lot! 
I think if its done without care then yes care for what she would feel that is. Maybe you just have to tell the truth about what youre feeling but its up to you!
Right but deep down Im sure you know that you dont need a relationship to feel content!
That was very nice of him. 
Wow that is a wonderful keepsake from him. I bet you really cherish it.
Thats nice. Was it a special occasion or anything ?
What did you have to eat ?
What kind of memories
Those were good years for sure
Oh wow Im sorry to hear that! loss can be hard 
Im sorry! Take the time to grieve and be there for your friend.
Congrats! that sounds like a good movie!
I saw it and it was a good  movie i dont usually watch marvel films
Sorry to hear that. You must be going through a tough time. 
You should try engaging in a hobby to divert your mind and when youre ready adopt a puppy from your local shelter. 
Hey congratulations. That must have been a lot of hard work. I wish I put more time into extracurricular stuff like that. Its a good look in the future. Especially the debate teamyou develop so many good life skills with that!
I bet... thats a lot of weekends and late evenings practicing and honing your skills. Im sure its a lot of positive intangibles developed that you will reap the awards from later on in life.
Glad to hear it! Health is such an important thing and the more you look after your body the better it will treat you. 
I agree now you will financially and physically secure. All the stress of not having insurance is far too much given our healthcare costs.
Uh oh! Are you going to ask him to pay for it? Or at least fix it?
Might be time to just stop letting him use your stuff unfortunately.
That is strange. Did you like the gift?
That is for sure! Someone must really like you!
Oh my sorry to hear that. How is he holding up?
I am sure it is. Just need to give him time and support right now. 
What are those? Your grades?
Math was always my least favorite. Are you British?
Did you find out why he was fleeing the draft?
Thats a bit much of him to dodge his country when they needed him dont you think?
That is awesome! I bet you are so proud
That should motivate him to keep up the good work!
Were you playing in a team?
Im glad youre taking it seriously parents have the ability to be the best thing that ever happened to their kids lives or the worst but Im sure youre doing your best
Hope youre enjoying it!
Thats great! What percentage are you thinking youll be getting?
Thats really good then. Im sure it will help you financially
Howd it end up after the fact ?
I hope it all went well for you.
Thats always fun to see those random memories crop up when you least expect. What kind of board games were they?
Ive played Monopoly before of course. I wonder why thats the game everyones played during their childhood... But yeah Risk Ive never played dunno why. Maybe you should grab one and get some friends or family involved for old times sake.
That is funny i feel like someone should have said something though
That is great well know you know what not to do on a plane lol
How long have you had it?
Is this recent. Do you know why?
Wow thats lucky.
oh i cot ya. i am glad you have your stuff.
Which Six Flags did you go to?
I live right by that one!
Nice such relics of the past really hit you with a wave of nostalgia. Did the gear still fit you?
Oh I see that is to be expected. At least you still have the gear!
Oh nice how did it go?
Thats great! Glad it worked out for you and your dog was safe! I hear so many bad stories about people loosing pets.
Haha I bet it wasnt that bad....was it
OK now Im curious...what the hell did you do
You must feel so content at this point. It must have taken a lot of hard work to get to this point!
I am glad that it is finally paying off! Keep it up because independence is the sweetest thing. 
That is unfortunate is it possible to go through chemotherapy again?
I hope everything works out for you 
That is so sad. Dogs become part of the family so when something like that happens it is like losing a family member
I am so sorry for your loss within time you will heal. Just try to cherish the memories that you was left with Think about all the good times
Yeah I have a doughter as well and understand.  I guess kids will be kids!
The things they do make no sense.  Kid logic!
Uh oh do you think you were being rowdy?
Its Ok. Everyone can chang ein life. Do you drink too much?
Oh my sounds like you have the dreaded roommate situation on your hands. Have you tried talking to him? 
I see if youre in college try talking to your Resident Advisor about it. 
That will be nice. Are you going to have some free time?
You could get a nice dinner with that. Have fun.
Is the car terribly damaged?
I hope it will be ok. Were you late for your work?
That sucks it takes so long for them to arrive!
I feel that even though I prefer Winter
I get that but all seasons are good you miss the ones that it is not
Is that a game ?
No Im sure Im a bit older than you.
you can train and get better
i thin yyouca you just have to believe in yursef
I get that too bad we cannot refund movies
Nice! You must be so proud of him to achieve such a milestone! 
He must be for his children to seem him as an inspiration! 
Oh god! Is everyone you care about OK?
Man i am so sorry i could not imagine.
Do you find value in them still?
I think you should keep them instead of throwing them away.
How did he get it?
I hope it wasnt too painful for him and he disinfected and bandaged that wound up.
Oh my god! Are you ok? was anyone home? Did they take anything important?
Thats weird. I am happy you have your possesions.
Who is it? 
I bet she is! I am so glad you get to see her. Moms are awesome!
Was the fire set by someone or an accident?
Thats horrible i am sorry!
That is good.  It is nice to focus on the positives
I am glad to hear that.  I hope it keeps staying that way
Ugh teenagers can be so troublesome some times! I hope you made him realize what he did was wrong. 
Yup but what I dont like about that age is having to stay up all night!
Helping animals sometimes brings great pleasure. You did a good deed
Awe. Ya it doesnt take much to get attached to something that you are nursing back to health
That sounds like a cool place to go! Can you bring your cat there?
That is so cool! We adopted a cat from a shelter and he is the best cat!
Nice! You must be so proud! How old is he?
What an angel! Im looking forward to starting my own family too.
Ewww. Adults should know better than that. I think I would have been grossed out
Thats wonderful! I bet it was a nice trip down memory lane.
Memories are the most precious thing we can have in life I think.
Wow thats been a long time. Did you two have a good time together?
Thats great that you two reconnected like it! Im happy for you.
It is ok. Most spider are not dangerous. What is it a big one?
What did your friends do?
On no. Was this at a public place?
Oh no when can you take it again?
Dang that is unfortunate!
Hey thats great!  How long has it been?
Dang.  I bet youre gonna have some good times together!
Whats going to happen?
Oh gosh i think it was just a tree falling i bet.
Oh I hope you get it! It can really help out or just be a splurge 
Definitely its good to work for a company that does that too
a B? Hmm well you know how it is hope your stomach feels better!
Youll be fine next time just look and see how clean their bathrooms are it gives you a good idea how their kitchens are!
Thats wonderful. I also love the holidays. Its the perfect time for families.
Sounds like heaven! I am also looking forward to them too.
Thats awesome. You must be so proud of him.
The LSAT is no joke. He must have studied very hard.
What kind of cupcake do you like from there?
Those are so tasty are you excited?
Awesome! I hope you do well! When do you take it?
You will do great just stay confident!
Communication is key have you talked to him about it?
Age doesnt amtter show him you are ready.
Oh no next time you should bring a friend to be safe.
Its okay you got out fine this time!
What does he normally talk about?
Oh yeah that really is a waste of time
Nice!  Did you have a good time?
Thats good.  Stay confident and let things happen naturally!
Gratz. Whats the secret?
Good to hear glad you guys are happy!
Was he drinking heavy? Im sorry hope the night wasnt too bad.
Im sorry to hear that! haha guess hes not invited next time!
Dont be! You are awesome the way you are!
Our imperfections help us stay unique! Do worry yourself with that there are so many other things that can get us down and worry us! Just keep being awesome!
Hey... congratulations to you on both fronts! That sounds like double good news. It was probably fun having your hard work rewarded with seeing the faces of all your loved ones and having them personally congratulate you.
Well its good to have you join the workforce in society. You seem like a positive person who can contribute well. Hopefully you find a passion that utilizes your hardearned degree.
Ahh is he a troublemaker right now? Most of the time its the friends they hang out with. Young people are easily influenced by the people around them.
Yes he needs a firm hand to lead the way out of this kind of behaviours. You need to step up and introduce some strict schedules so he wont have time to do anything bad. 
Yeah gotta be careful one day you might hurt yourself pretty bad
Nice what year?
Dang that must look great!
im sorry to hearyou were homeles
That is great congrat!
Interesting...you sure it wasnt fish that washed up on the shore
Gotcha..hope that didnt ruin your whole day
Why what happened to make you feel that
Nice I never understood why thats embarassing haha
Oh wow that sucks! Hope it wasnt too embarassing!
Oh wow Im sorry! Thats not cool they would be hurt if people were laughing at them
Thats great! Where are they working?
Thats got to be frustrating. Have you thought of maybe working at the same place?
That is scary! Hope you did not find yourself in the bad part of town
That is horrible! I bet a little part of you was scared
Oh wow! That is intense! I am glad he didnt get kicked out!
It sounds like it!
That is amazing. Sounds like you have a really good support system.
I have a few. It really does help when times are not so great.
That is pretty neat especially if it gives you good memories!
Now you can carry on that tradition.
I do too. I wish we could have fall weather longer.
Same here and next thing you know its a blizzard.
Oh what happened instead? Did your friends throw you a party?
Wow! What a great surprise! You should thank the person that planned it!
That is awesome! I cannot wait until my student loans are paid off!
I am happy for you! 
Oh dont be! Just have faith in yourself and be confident that you can make it in. 
I see think of it as having a conversation with a friend. It will make it easier! 
They do have nice bags! I hope you are able to get one!
They are but if you save up a little at a time it wont be that bad!
Nice! How are you celebrating for him?
So cute! Take a lot of photos so hell be able to see them in the future!
Yum! Sushi is so good Im sure youll enjoy it! I like the eel roll and spicy tuna roll.
Im sure you will! Maybe start with a simple roll like the california roll or ask the waitress for recomendations. 
Where are you going? I would say if your gut is telling you that it is not good then I would suggest listening to it
Lol. Oh. Coasters are fun. Very exciting!
A really nice piece of hair?  Yikes.  Did you send it back?
Well good.  Hopefully you got your food remade though.  
Oh dang that is too bad.  Can you guys video call?
Oh OK hopefully you have some friends you can bring over and share your traditions.
Im right there with you. Ive always been a homebody. I dont like going out as much. Sometimes people say millennials and technology have disconnected people too much.. that could be true. But at least were comfortable doin it.
Absolutely. Im the kind of person that can be around for people a little bit but get drained by them. I think thats getting more and more common for others. Could you tell me what kind of animals you have real quick!
That is awesome I was an early reader as well! That is a great accomplishment!!
I hope they both keep the love for reading and writing!
Oh no! Im so sorry!  Are you able to be up for another one soon?
Oh great! Thats sooner than in my company.  I know youll get one. Just keep working hard and good luck!
It happens to the best of us! I know the lady understands!
Maybe youll never see her again! 
Sorry to hear that I know that you probably feel disappointed but there will be other opportunities! 
Yes and you will succeed eventually. 
Do you have some uncertainty in you life right now?
That is really tough.  Are you in a career now?
Do you have any opportunity for an internship of some sort?  The career advisers from your school may be able to help.
I did that myself and I can tell you it was well worth it.  I am much happier now than I ever was.  I wish you very good luck on whatever you decide to do!
As in living alone or single?
Oh no. Thats terrible. 
Oh wow Im sorry to hear that! Put your leg up and relax this weekend! 
I hope your insurance does too! Just take care of youself and I hope you feel better soon!
That sounds really frustrating to deal with. You sound like youre selfaware and anticipating the problem though. Perhaps youve already started preparing to look elsewhere?
Well luckily Google is so helpful these days. Theres tons of templates out there. Its kind of annoying to deal with especially because its being motivated by your company possibly disappearing.. but it wont take long at all to craft a good one especially because oftentimes the shorter they are the better
Nice. Did you find a good hairdresser?
I am sorry to hear that! My dog is a part of the family so I understand. I hope everything is okay.
It is scary to think about I hope for the best!
that is a cool job
Sounds like a great trip. I hope you guys have a fun time.
That is exciting. When is she due?
Yes it is! Is she having a boy or a girl?
Awww! Congratulations! I hope everything goes smoothly.
I totally understand.  Life can sometimes seem overwhelming.  I have learned to stop take a deep breath and do one thing at a time.
Its just a way to calm the body and the mind.  It is SO easy to fall into the trap of anxiety.  But falling there doesnt accomplish a thing.  Take a breath focus on one small success then move to the next.  
Yikes! Bet the car payment is not worth it. lol
Sometimes jealousy can become us. But most times it does not pay to be that way cause 9 times out of 10 those kind of people is just living off credit so technically it is not something they own out right
Woah hope she doesnt report you! Jk
I see hope she is able to understand!
What are you applying for?
That sounds interesting when do you learn if you got in?
What game and what kind of award
Way to go! That is a great accomplishment!
Oh wow that is so exciting! Im sure you are excited to move in.
Aww thats great! I have two dogs they become part of the family! Enjoy your new house 
You sound very content. What makes you happy?
Well that is a good reason. You are blessed.
Oh no I would have had a heart attack.
Sell the house!
Nice how was it?
Hope youre all right!
Are you doing the cheesecake for your family?
Thats really nice! You should show her you appreciate her. Maybe cook her dinner!
Ahh yes thats very nice too good for her! You guys have a happy marriage.
Ugh that must so inconvenient and uncomfortable! 
I can relate I get red face when ever I have to come infront of the class to present. 
Oh gosh is he going to take you to the Superbowl at least?
Just one ticket that sounds lonely for him.
Nice! I want to take my daughter when she is older. Did you go to Disneyland or world?
California is fun to visit as well! Glad you all had fun.
aww that is great!
yeah my mom did that for me a few years back
Oh naughty. Did anyone see you?
Well its not a huge deal in the grand scheme of the universe! I am sure it will be fine.
Are you making a trip to see your family?
Great. It is always good to see your family. Is it very far?
That would definitely be a difficult thing to find out. How did you find out?
Wow. That is really horrible. I am so sorry that happened to you. 
Haha.. I feel like thats almost a rite of passage when going to water parks. Ive had that happen too. Hopefully it wasnt too traumatic for you. I almost lost my glasses once too! Now that was really scary
Thats the spirit. Its good that you dont take yourself too seriously. Heck my roommate walked in on me doing some selfpleasure just yesterday.. I used to think that was my worst nightmare but in the moment I just did my best to laugh it off so we could move forward faster
I hate when that happens! The same thing happened to me when I moved out of my apartment. They kept my security deposit because they needed to replace carpet.
Mine hadnt been replaced in 6 years I found that out after the fact. 
Thats pretty awesome congrats
Confidence is key its honestly what upper management looks for not necessarily technical skills right off the bat...just like Leo DiCaprio in Catch Me if You Can haha
Good on you. You need to be comfortable in your own skin and its not other peoples business to tell you how to live. 
Yes they should really learn to concentrate on their own life instead of complaining about other people.
Did you get up to check it out?
That would have scared me. At least it wasnt an intruder.
that is exciting
yeah same but it can be fun
That is an amazing talent to have. I would be so scared!
Me too that would be terrible.
I hope you did it. Dont worry too much.
If you need to you can always take it again. Good luck!
What happened? Hope you are okay?
Omg that is so scary I am so sorry to hear that. 
Did you find anything great?
What a wonderful memory.  
Oh hey thats awesome!  That is awesome right?
That is awesome!!!! Congratulations!
Did you suffer any injuries?
Why did you feel guilty? People really shouldnt drive drunk.
Yeah i wanted to tell you about the time i was hit by a drunk driver im so happy to still be alive after that experience
Yeah he was punished hes in jail still
sorry to hear! do you have any idea about the break up? did you think about it ?
sorry again! hope youll get relief from this sadness. Please concentrate on your interests to divert your mind from this.
Wow thats awesome! I have never been to an actual concert.
Ugh those articles always get me too...  What was wrong with her? 
Jeez! Its so unfortunate... very sad really. 
That is nice of you. What did you do?
He will I have faith.
No problem. What kind of work does he do?
Thats not good. Do you own a gun?
That is always number one goal.
3 years is a long time. How come?
Oh I see. They must miss you too.
Yes. I do not have a Facebook.
Yes I do not like walmart.
Thats horrible. Did you tell on him?
Thats a tough situation.
I guess it makes you appreciate things you used to take for granted lol. But it doesnt last forever and is worth it. 
Thats a full time job raising a human
Oh Im sure you are lonely. Maybe you can join some kind of club that lets you meet new friends?
Thats a good idea! This way you can also meet friends for yourself but also maybe meet new friends for your children to hang out with while you do with their moms!
oh man. im all about discipline! I dont like spoiled bratty kids
yes ive heard some parents dont ever say no to their kids. makes no sense
Did things end amicably? I hope everything is good now!
I understand that I hope things work out well for you both in the end!
That is a very blessed day. It is something you will never forget.
Yes I couldnt agree more. It is remarkable how your feeling suddenly change.
I bet that must have been nerve wracking until it happened.
Oh Im sure. I would not like to be in a situation like that. Good thing everything worked out for you.
Oh really? What happened with your family and friend then?
Oh wow thats awful. Stuff like that really teaches you to appreciate what youve got and to not take it for granted.
I agree someimes we just know
exactly i get that entirely!
Thats great! How did they surprise you?
That is so sweet of them I hope you enjoyed it!
Awww That sucks man. Hopefully they dont say mean things to you about being lonely.
Well i used to be lonely a lot but i eventually found someone. I think you will too.
Yeah that is always odd to me before they can talk they are already unique!
That is how it goes sometimes you can just figure them out immediately
I understand that onethey are my favorite place to eat
That has happened to me too many times to count
That must have been and intense and emotional moment for you.
Uau what a surreal moment.I always believe kids have a lot to teach us.
Im sure it will! I didnt get along with my dad until i became an adult.
Yes it did. I believe she just waited it out and tried to neutralize the conversation when we were together. 
Where you not secure in your self?
You can track her down to say sorry or would that be creepy?
Wow so your going to take being a bad person to the grave. Maybe youll see her in the next life?
Lucky you! That is rare. Maybe one day people will think of you like that?
I have something totally different. My boss is clueless to the world and have no business being a leader. 
Well Ive been in the business all my life and have worked for some great people. So I pull from what I learned from them.
Its crazy how quickly kiddos grow! Even in a few weeks time! Do you see your friend and her baby often?
That is how life goes! Different schedules and demands  Im sure shes so thrilled when she does get to see you!
Wow that is an amazing accomplishment!  Congratulations!  You gotta be feeling like youre on top of the world after that!
My first thought was California but then theres Venice Italy and then either way thats an amazing destination!
Oh wow.  Not only to be able to do all the running but to view the scenery!
Im sorry to hear that! How did you find out? 
Thats a real bummer but as they say there are plenty of fish in the sea!
I practice boxing. I love to punch the sandbags.It is very therapeutic.
Oh no that is terrible!  How did your daughter take it?
Oh poor thing.  I hope she is doing better now.  Losing a pet is extremely hard!
ooo they are gonna love it just its expensive I remember when it was only 20 to get in.
Which one are you going to California or Florida ?
Cool.  Somethings never change.  What did you reflect upon?
Yeah I miss my dad.  He died several years ago.  What kind of car is he looking for?
Im trying to get into it. we have our first baby on the way and need to reorganize everything. Do you have tips? 
My big thing is im like O I may need that leave it out of the tote box. Before I know it I have more stuff laying around then when I started.
Well sometimes people are busy and dont have the time to check emails
Text and emails are still the best option. until a nw way is created.
Isnt that what sisters are for?  What were you guys upset about?
Maybe once you feel like you can bring it up again you can try to approach the topic from another angle.
Congratulations! Where did you travel from and where did you end up?
That must have been quite the culture shock glad it all worked out though!
I know that actually happens to me sometimes! Last year I didnt get accepted into this fellowship and for a couple of weeks I was underestimating myself a lot.
Yea for sure I definitely learned that sometimes life just works in a funny way. Whens the last time you have been really disappointed? 
I totally understand why he was mad. Why did you tell her?
I guess he wanted to be available if she needed him.
What is a back neighbor? And that is crazy!
Oh my! Im glad she apologized!
I understand. I am think the same thing. What is your health issue?
Yes we should try to yourself heathy
Oh it sure is I feel the same way. They grow up so fast! 
One of them is! I have an 18 year old and a 12 year old.
I bet you were beautiful on that day.  I hope that confidence has carried on since then!
It would be hard to replicate that day for sure but I bet you have a lot to be confident about. You got this!
I bet its tough. A regular income is nice but the freedom you get from working for yourselfs is better. 
Your so lucky. Insurance is my number one worry every month. 
Oh ya? What happened?? Im intrigued
Woah plot twist. She brought him along to meet you? 
OH I love the beach!!  Which beach are you going to go to?
PCB is where we always go! If you want to drive a little bit go to HUNTS in PCB  its off the beaten path but THE best seafood and prices  just go early like 4oclock for dinner or you wont get in!!
Why didnt you go?
Is she always a flake? Maybe time for a new friend?
Did he do anything to you and your mom?
I am glad that nothing happened.
No you didnt tell me! What happened?
Oh no! Is she okay?! Dont beat yourself up too much you couldnt have ever imagined that she had been in an accident.
I love Fireball.
No what happened?
Thats horrible. Will they reschedule?
Who tell me!
Wow what happened?
That is very nice gift. Did you bought anything for him for Fathers day?
Oh what job was the interview for?
I think you got it man! Congratz!
oh my  are you really serious?
I am very glad it has a happy ending. Sounds a bit scary
Did you ever tell your friend?  
Oh no I hate when that happens. I can sympathize with you because thats happen to me twice! Its okay in the winter time and you can sort of keep your food fresh but not during the summer
I wish refrigerators would have a warranty that replaced food when they went bad. 
Wao you must fell weird about it! what you thinki to do about it?
SUper tough situation i think you should let her know and let her decides next
Oh Im sure you were embarrassed! But maybe you can laugh about it now?
Well Im sure mom had a laugh lol! I can imagine how you felt at the time though!
Ah that sounds fantastic! Which ocean will you be enjoying?
Sounds awesome! Do you have a beachside beverage or traditions that you enjoy? Mine would be tequila  lime...very Jimmy Buffett 
Well thats impressive! I can see why you are proud. Sounds like a hard working young lady!
Yes I was the same way too! I started working two days after I turned 16 so I could have my own money too!
Absolutely I agree I always try to not even bring cart unless I have too many too carry.
Yes me too Now if everyone would just take our lead lol
oh wow. Do you know whether it will be a boy or girl yet?
First time parent?
What kind of work do you do?
Actually Im not but it sounds very interesting and by working with different organizations I would imagine its also exciting and new every day.
I agree its always nice to have people around you who are smarter in some areas
Yes men are definitely a bad idea when it comes to life and business
Baby belugas are cute but not as cute as your baby!
That is so funny! I dont think shell want to be compared to an ant when she gets older. Youll have to remind her.
That is great!!  Sometimes we moms get a bit forgotten so to have an entire day where we are just loved is such a great feeling.
Those words are the things we cherish more than any other thing I love it when my girls do that!
I am not sure it was pretty random
No nothing at all
That is exciting news!  I bet you were so surprised!
Ha!  What a neat day to announce it  did they do any special kind of announcement?  I see so many videos of interesting and neat ways to make that announcement.
I do watch Netflix sometimes.  Do you watch?
I havent heard of that one.  What genre does it fall in?
Did it go your way?
That is great  have you found another job yet?
I hate traffic too it makes me angry
People are so rude when they drive these days
I can imagine! That was a terrifying movie.
That happened to me too.. with the other Exorcist movies and the Ring movies. Even though they scared me I was too curious to not see the others.
She sounds like a person with great ability. Great choice of friend.
Thats great. I wish I had someone so close like that!
Is that a bad sign? Perhaps the plant is not getting enough nutrition or sunlight?
Oh I see. I am not much of a horticulturist but it makes sense that it could be oversaturated.
Put what word ? You mean published the info?
So what breed did you get ?
I would be too! You did what you had to do!
Do you find the home buying experience worth it?
How long do you plan on staying in that house?
Well thats awesome! Im happy for you!
You shouldnt because that is  a very stressful job
And dont forget how many years they have to study in order to get a license for surgery
Really? Do you know what you want to do when you graduate? I know sometimes its tough to settle on a path.
That sounds like a great career plan. You will be filling a very important role in the physicians practice!
Im not sure. What would you do?
Maybe I will try that. Do you think it will work?
Oh no that sounds like an awful situation. What did you end up doing after that?
So exciting! It can be fun to have a roommate
I love that. Lots of new friends haha
Ive heard a lot of people say something similar. Did you go there a lot?
Where I grew up didnt have one nearby so I get a little jealous hearing about it.
Good lord you must have had Facebook for a LONG time! I started mine in college so there isnt anything from my younger years.
Oh ok lol. I completely understand. I had a friend share a post about making mix tapes from the radio with a cassette player. Totally remember doing that!
I am 33 
Me too bullies are part of the reason that I homeschooled.
Well I was referring to my own kids. They have adjusted well at 17 and 19.
I also saw it and felt like it was pretty good. Much better than the My Little Pony Movie. That was TORTURE.
Yeah it was so boring. Even my kids got bored and they had been dying to see it
Thats not nice of them. Why do they keep taking it??
Sorry to hear that. I found that it helps to have multiple savings accounts so whenever you get a certain amount of money like 5 10 save it and be strict not to spend it.
LOL! This is perfect timing because I had the  You are an adult not a child conversation with my girlfriend not too long ago. I had left popsicle wrapper on the night stand and it got sticky. I argued if you are willing to date someone who likes to eat Popsicles in bed then you have to deal with the consequences. 
Okay it wasnt just one it was three One cherry and two grape. How anyone can eat just one at a time? Oh the number of wrappers was also brought up. Like I dont care if yuo bought them for the kids I am part of this household as well. I tried to make it a teaching moment about how if you dont get the popsicles first someone else would but I think my arguments have been falling on deaf ears for awhile now lol
Wow. Im so sorry to hear that. That would be incredibly hard. What happened?
Thats horrible. Im really sorry about your friend. 
Thats a beautiful name! Its cool you honored your friend in that way. 
I cant even imagine. Ive never lost anyone super close to me yet...
Did you not have a car? Thats hard. I dont have one now and use Uber and Lyft all the time.
That is incredible! I swear some things in life are determined by fate. Im glad you were able to get a car.
Its incredible and so important. Thats why I try to pass on the kindness whenever I am able.
Yes.My first was when i turned 18.
LOL.You had to beg your husband for a surprise party??
Did you have candles or a flash light to help yous see?
Well atleast you have something to help you guys.
That is great! My B.S.  I always hate saying that because I have to say I have my BS in psychology is in Psychology.
Pet? Like dogs and other?
Wow seriously I hate those pets being around me
Congrats thats a step forward
I am so sorry. I cant imagine what you must have went through.
That must have been really hard. 
Really?  What kind of work does he do?
Wow.. that is impressive.  Are you guys still friends?  Maybe he could get you a job in one of his stores.
Awww... reminds me of the show hoarders when the family members argue over silly things like that.  What was the necklace all about did you make it or something?
Well why did you have it if it belonged to them?  Did you pawn it?
Thats sweet of them. Maybe you could make it up to her buy getting her a special mom necklace with your spare cash.
All the time.  That is part of listening to music I suppose.  The songs remind you of when you first heard them.
I know what you mean.  However the older I get the more I want to go back LOL.
Oh no!  What happened to it?
So sad!  I am sorry.  Dont feel too bad its natural for them to want to be outside.
it is so sad to know but my mother is rather sick of flu and not dying 
Oh yes but it is not as bad and you cannot call it dying like in Cancer patient 
Did you get sick afterwards 
i do not think sushi is that good too. The best option is to stop eating them in any form of food
Damn that sounds like a pretty good one! How did that turn out?
Thats how all pranks should be!
I am so sorry to hear that. Is there any chance you might be able to reconcile???
Oh thats too bad.  I dont want to overstep but I always like to encourage people to hold on to their love for each other no matter what trials come up. 
I think thats good! If you are meant to be together youll feel it and it will work out I think if you just keep your conviction and stick with it. Good luck with it! 
Aw thats sweet! I really am hoping yall make it through this together. 
So sadyou can never force someone to love you. You will find the right person for you.
Dont give up on love.It the best feeling ever to experience. Wish you well.
Do you have a good chance with her. Have you talked to her about it?
That will be better. Talk to her before you lose her
Probably one where I got a limo with all my friends and went to this restaurant it was great. What about yours what makes your friends so great too?
I wish my friends bought me alcohol that would make for a hell of a night! 
hi are you there?
That must be hard I always wished I had a sister though I have a brother 
Oh my! You must have been terrified! Did everything turn out ok?
That is not good at all. That is a very scary situation.
I have not tried yet but i feel like it would be enjoying and full of delight
I live in a place where it only snows once in 10 years. So i think i am passing on that
You are so lucky. Mums are the best. What do you do for her?
You should spend time with her whilst you can. My mum died and I wish I had been with her more.
Nothing went wrong we just have different lives in different places. I go visit every now and then.
I did not revise. Sometimes exams are failed and things are not corrected.
That is great that you have an awesome Mom!
Yes I do love my mom very much.
ooh am so sorry about that. Have you tried to talk to her?
that will help you know her stand on your relationship
well i am a mover so i have to bring heavy furniture up and down stairs.
it pays decent and feeds the kids so I cant complain.
Thats awesome. What are you majoring in?
Sometimes its good to have something you enjoy make money so you can pursue your passion without worrying about it.
That is such a bummer. Why did you keep watching them?
I understand being fascinated by them they can be very intriguing. Maybe you should stop watching as many though. 
I like scary movies as well so I know how addicting they can be.
It is actually Scream. 
Oh yeah Donald Trump is such a charlatan. He has some really shady history too. Im actually a Christian and a conservative but Im appalled that everyone on the right have fallen for this guy. Hes so against what the real conservative values are supposed to be.
Yeah I am sad about the whole left vs. right thing in general. Ultimately we should all be uniting against the corrupt people that are running amok in the government. 
awwww. congratulations. what is your major
lovely. thats really great. wishing you all the best
That is interesting how does he buy you stuff or is he just really nice?
I am happy for you wish I could find a nice lover like that.
Yes I think they offer a great bridge to the past. Do you?
Thats great. It sounds like a very good situation to be in.
 Im very sorry. Have you tried telling her how you feel? That could affect her decision.
I know its hard to build the confidence needed to do something like that but you dont want to keep them to yourself. If you really think she is the woman of your dreams then you have to try
Im not quite following. Anything you want to tell me about?
Well did you have any story or anything that you had in mind that you wanted to tell me? I told you a story of mine before so you owe me haha.
That is really nice of her.  It is nice to have someone to help you do things sometimes.
Yes.  Too many people these days are mean to one another!
Thats so sad I hope youve gotten over it.
Thats good death is a natural part of life.
Nou dont have to be 
Yesu will surely get over it
That is very special and I am so happy for you.
Yes married for 15 years and it is still great.
Thats good to have a loving family.
I am i love them very much. However we live on opposite parts of the country.
Wow 7 years? You were really young then
But did you tell your friend about it later?
Oh no! That must have been super embarrassing! How did you react to that?
My goodness well I guess that happens to all of us at least once.
That sounds fun starting a new life is always great!
West Coast is fun but it can be expensive.
Because she was what?
I think that is a good news for you both since you are not married
I can imagine the loneliness someone can experience.
Get your self a friend to stay with for a couple of months.
Wow please make it real.
Wow I belief u can make it.
Who is supplying these snacks? 
Sounds like a cupboad cleaning is necessary. If they aint around they cant be eaten.
why did she go visiting?
really? so she would have travelled with him
That sounds horrible. You mustve been mad.
Where was this?
Wellit can happen like that atimes
Yesit really hurts
am sorry to hear that. what happened to the mother
soryy may she rest in peace please try comfort your wife
Damn very confident huh? What job did you apply for?
Oh wow that outta pay very well.
Oh boy that is the worst so frustrating! Has there been any change since?
Hahaha you put the hammer down good for you bro. How are things with the new wife going?
You remember that show hahaha totally my twin. Im glad for you bro. Good luck to you!
Oh my god! How old is he?
You really need to let him know not to do that again he couldve really gotten himself and others hurt!
Really? What makes them A list?
Yeah I have lol. Whats your brothers name?
Not being able to fit into an old wedding dress is one of a womans worst nightmare.
The dress was a few years old I couldnt believe it didnt fit.
I like Starbucks. But theyre a little expensive for me to go there often.
Thats good to knowkeep it up
Wow that will be so devastating for you
So how did you now do it
Report to their management
Just give it a trial
Haha how did she feel when she found out?
Oh no! Those cookies sure do sound delicious though.
Dang I hated that. At least its not cow poop thats worst. 
Oh man you gotta super clean it have the professionals do it even 
How do you make it?
Good to know.  I will do it like it next time.
Congrats! What gender did your child end up being?
Thats great my man! I cant wait for my first son. So far 6 daughters 
dont panic and dont be harsh on the kid. perhaps spend time going over the subject together? or maybe hes having other trouble thats affecting his studies
its better to do what youre passionate about. do that and success follows
Thats cool.  For what class
God works in mysterious ways
wow. I would be too. I love guitar its my favorite musical instrument. I wonder if he was born blind

that sounds terrible! I hope everything gets sorted! Be positive 
Thats amazing congratulations. 12 Kids your amazing.
Haha your a player.
Thats creepy. What do you think they were hyenas? 
Must have been quite a sight.

Hope u will not indulge in such act like theft again?
Wow that is a great news
Wow that is a really good club
Is this your first son?
Awesome! Any daughters? What will be your sons name?
holy Moses! I hate them things. Flying rats is what they are.
lol. dont do the crime if cant face the Bat 
Praise God man! He really is amazing and we should always be grateful for we have 
amen! so true. Its especially awesome when He picks us up in every fall. His love never fails
for real? that mustve been embarrassing. Sorry to hear about that
well thats good and bad. hopefully the joke didnt carry on too long
I love me some Tupac. Real talk.
Me too. I always end up on the 90s hip hop station on Pandora.
Sorry to hear that. Did someone do anything against the company selling the food?
Someone should have sued them.
Oh yes at least you will be in a position to help them in return
That is good. You have a good heart
You must feel awful  Why dont you come clean maybe you will feel better.
Yes Jesus can save you if you ask him.  He always forgive.
He deserved that I think.
Wow you must have felt jealous
Hahahaa its not easy though I would have done same
When you have responsibilities that you really care about you do what you have to. I commend him. ITs hard raising a family
Oh wow. Ive never heard of that many sick days.
So what was she lying to you about?
Oh she shouldnt have done that
Oh no how horrible
I hate public schools ooo
But its really cool atimes
Thats cool I did online school in high school
Well were pretty close in age
I remember him he was going to be a great actor.
Yeah he might do a pretty good job as that character.
Adapting to life is always good to do.
Thats a great attitude to have. You should keep with that.
How awful! how do you feel about it?
Yes I understand it is really sad when you find that people you have known a long time can be very different from what you thought.
Lols why didnt you do anything 
Awww but its still good that you didnt push him Cox it might lead to something else 
Oh My Goodness! How wonderful!!!! That is so awesome! Congratulations. 
Wow! I better! I Stopped at Associates of General Studies because I wanted to be a mom more. So that is a HUGE step for you! 
This is TRUE! I am glad to be at home with these guys right now. Have a great day! 
Congratulations! I hope to get a house next year
I bet! Hard work pays off
Things happen that are bad I am sure it wasnt your fault.
I am sure they forgave you in the end.
Music always seems to be better from the past I understand all too well.
I totally agree new music is not as good.
I get paid today as well! What game are you thinking about getting?
Didnt that game come out a few months ago? I got it shortly after I released and I wasnt very impressed. It wasnt a bad game but it certainly was not the best game.
Congratulations. That sounds like the fast track.
Cool. Maybe next year you will be a partner!
I hope you get it
I am so sorry to hear that! Is there a particular section you are having trouble with?
Ah! Thats quite understandable. It is tricky at first and nonintuitive. I practiced driving in reverse with cones in an abandoned lot. 
I know its hard but practice makes perfect! Keep trying and I am sure you will get it!
Why what is the matter?
Hmmm! That is just annoying being an alcoholic. I purely understand your situation as I have gone through it. Well! life goes on.
that is great..congrats....
Thats creepy honestly
Yeah whispering in someones ear is weird
Nice! What job is going for
Cool.  Hope he gets it I hear they pay pretty well
Just you. No security?
I would be too. 
Thats nice how long did it take you ?
Fantastic now do you have a job lined up?
Ive been in a fender bender not a total wreck.
Man how was your insurance policy for that?
Yes Several times in my life. Mostly me and my older brother when we were younger.
What started the fist fight in the first place?
I havent heard of it
Everything old makes a come back!
One of my favorite places to eat. I love the swirled ice cream cones.
Over priced food is no fun. I like dollar menus.
Yep! Not really that fun to have since you see things at times.
Man that is scary! Granted i like to hear things about that. 
Yes when I was young I did all the time but I think after I turned 18 I got this weird fear of being so high up in the air. What about you?
Wow thats really cool! You must be happy to know about that stuff its interesting!
What a creep. I hope that you told on him.
Some people are like that. Did you tell your husband?
Where are you headed ?
Great I hope you have a nice trip. How long will you be staying?
Thats great! It was meant to happen then
I would have been too. Ive never been fired. I always quit
I remember taking Home Ec. I loved that class
Oh wow puppies are nice.  What kind of puppy did you get?
Thats a nice breed of dog.  I just went on a camping trip with a relative who has one they are very loyal and smart of course.  Was heshe your first pet?
thats good! you should be proud of yourself
thats great! i hate when people cheat
I can only imagine having to wait at the table alone wondering if shed show up. At least it sounds like she finally arrived.  Did she specify a reason for being so late?
Thats good. I can somewhat relate. I think the longest Ive waited on someone was a colleague who was supposed to meet us at happy hour and ended up getting delayed by our boss for 45 minutes. We were glad she made it out but I did feel worse for her than for all of us.
Ahhh! Me too there is so much that can be done on the weekends!
I understand that! I have a bunch of pet snakes that wake me up thru the night!
Actually that has happened to me during Thanksgiving
Im from NC mountains it can be tricking driving when the snow is latying fast
That is a smart idea. Sometimes I would have no choice but to keep going bacsue of having to drive to work.No matter what the weather is.
I understand your pain. My parents are also separated.
It just makes you mature faster. Just look at it like blessing in disguise.
That sucks.   Did you end up coming up with an alternate plan?
Thats good to hear.  How was the beach?
That would take away from her time with you. Was it for you?
That would be a really nice surprise then!
whyd you steal it 
oh yea what kind of shirt was it 
What did you do to pass the time?
I love video games.
That sucks why didnt you find a new apartment?
Maybe you should leave Florida.
Oh thats nice what was she able to get for you?
thats awesome of her to be able to get you something you really wanted
Omg I have seen one of those!
Did she get mad at you?
haha that sucks! did you take himher out to pee recently?
What did you have for lunch?
That is amazing good work.
How long did it take you?
Oh wow. Did she break up with you?
Dont sweat it man. There is plenty of fish in the sea anyways.
Nice I wish I could do a wheelie!
Yeah I tried skateboarding in my childhood but was too scared to break something lol.
Oh no Im so sorry to hear that. Did you ever figure out what happened?
Oh well thats a somewhat happy ending I suppose.
Haha Im sorry! My dog is chill now but he ate a hole in the wall when he was a puppy lol
Yeah lol what breed is yours? Mine is a golden so he loves eating stuff. Now its thankfully just actual food.
Yea I am like that too. Did you apologize?
It happens. Like you said we cant all be perfect.
Who did you do all those things with? Sounds like a wonderful day!
They must have been really happy.
There are so many spectacular views on this planet
Its a shame that people are letting these marvels pass them by.
That can really make you lose your faith in wanting to trust people
No not really because we are all human and make mistakes.
Oh wow! My son was terrified of tornadoes because of that darn movie and we dont really even get tornadoes where we live! Did you ever live through a tornado?
Aw poor little thing! How did you overcome this? Or are you still afraid of them?
Your mom sounds awesome!  Wow what a cool thing to say!  
We get carried away with our emotions sometimes. Did you explain it to them?
Im glad youre not too prideful to admit your mistakes to your kids and used it as a teaching opportunity.
That is pretty awesome I know if I ever got the chance it would change my life as well.
I understand that as long as I could understand the language I think I would be great anywhere.
if its an older iphone i would treasure it 
everyone values things differently
Oh wow that is a dangerous job.
have you had it tested ?
so you have like tunnel vision where ?
Yeah that can be annoying especially in Walmart since so many people go there. It stresses you out when you dont need it to.
Yeah everyone just seems miserable so it kind of drags you down too. But its a necessary evil.
that is why I am scared to have kids that sounds terrible
that seems to be the case you win some you lose some I guess
Who would that be?
I love seeing mine too. I know how happy that must make you feel. Mine are local.
thats good to hear.  my kids will returning to school soon as well.  I cant wait!
Every little accomplishment counts! What bills did you have to pay?
Sorry to hear that. Well at least this will be a weight off your shoulders.
wow youre so determined! Did you pass your exam?
yay! congrats! thats really awesome. you should be proud of yourself
Thats really exciting! I would be so happy about that. 
Thats what I would do too. Do you have something in mind? 
Forget him. Get yourself a real man.
If he really loved you he would pay attention to your every need. Kick him to the curb.
Be positive. Dont deviate your mind while driving. Concentrate completely on driving. You can.
Sorry to hear this. Hope youll get out from this fear and become a good driver. 
Do you cook a lot with tomatoes
People just dont seem to pay attention when they are in a hurry.
Thats the part that bothers me the most. When they just cut in front of you with no warning.
I know a lot of people in real life through that kind of stuff. Has been pretty great for me after 11 years. How is it for you so far.
Well we met through going to conventions and i even visited some myself. Really great bunch of people and i see places.
well you sound like a good person
why thank you!
Oh wow. Thats crazy.
Im glad you made amends then and no drama.
Thats pretty amazing. She must be skillful regardless.
Yea experience and skills matter a lot more.
I am familiar with that.  That is frustrating.
I ask myself the same thing.  Sometimes I think they get mad at something we do.
That is good. Do you have strong feeling for each other?
That is cute
Things? Like what kind of things?
I know what you mean! Im literally doing the same thing right now babysitting my neighbors dogs in her big twostory house all alone. Makes me feel like someones watching me...
Thats really good to hear.  Whats going on?
I work from home too.  Its so nice to be able to do laundry and things on my breaks.  Im so productive around the house
and I can stay in my PJs all day long!
Yeah of course I can! That sounds heartless. Maybe that shows you who your friends truly are and you should maybe look elsewhere... Could be a wakeup call.
Oh I misunderstood! I thought you meant you werent invited to one that you later found out about. Hah! Then I guess the wakeup call is you have really good friends! So you like surprise parties then? I never did.
What kinds of things are you talking about?
Thats not very fair a kind reminder couldve gone a long way.
I have been there many times.
I love going to the Spurs games.
Yes where did you go to college?
That is so disgusting.  I hate seeing that!
Sugar will do that to kids every time.  Just dont let them on a  roller coaster to make it even worse.
That sounds really painful!  You should pick them up.
They must not listen very well.
Qdoba is the BOMB! Although I think I prefer Chipotle slightly more.
Yeah but Chipotle has queso now! But yeah it isnt as good as Qdoba queso. 
Wow! How is that even possible?
I wonder if they ever feel like they dont get a childhood?
Sounds like you are lucky.
I figure your son is pretty happy as well.
couldnt ask for a better day
That is no fun you always hope that first one hits so they are more receptive the rest of the time
Well there is always next time!
you should take the dogs to a dog park after work and meet people!
Definitely. I think even Waze app will tell you in you search around me. 
Wow that is sweet of him does he have a crush on you?
Huh well maybe he is starting his campaign lol
I get that some are just not well trained at all
Oh? Thats not good. Do you think he has lots of secrets?
Im sorry  I do hope things can be worked out
I assume you dont get to see them often?
Thats too bad. I bet you miss them.
Sorry to hear about the bad news.
How long ago did she die?
I hope you got it.
Congrats! You deserve it for keeping your faith!
Well you know shell get over it but it does hurt.
oh how nice. What are your plans in that regard for the future?
What a dream come true for you thatll be.
Oh man bills. Thats awesome!
Does anyone help you with the bills?
awh thats so sweet how long have you two known one another? 
sounds like a great friendship! 
Oh no. How old is he?
Friendship is special. Did he do something to his friend?
Man thats gotta be a horrible feeling. I think it would help if you try not to compare yourself to others.
I hope things turn out better for you. Keep fighting.
Oh man thats awesome. I hope you get it!
Glad you rocked that interview. Sounds like its gonna be a sweet gig.
Awww I bet that brought back memories.
What will you do with it now?
Thats pretty much teaching their kids to worry about appearances than learning too. Thats too bad.
Did you name it?
Thats cute. I bet hes happy.
You kinda want to hold their hand but you know its best they solve some problems on their own. You cant be with them all the time.
It is truely for the best. Try not to worry.
thats amazing! She must be excited.
Must be nice to have more income coming into the family.
Is he going to be okay?
Well I bet he appreciates that. We all want to be babied sometimes.
Lol. Did you tell her? You can just buy another one.
Just buy another one and dont eat it. lol
Thats sucks. Does the culprit know?
That is unacceptable. What are you going to do?
That sounds so fun! 
Take some medication with you just in case.
So...what happened to her
In real life? Or are you making this up
Ive never imagined something like that before. Where did you see this?
Thats nuts. Did the owner do anything?
I suffer a lot too when my wife is gone. What happened to him?
Ah the evil cancer. Took my grandmother as well. I am sure hes off in a better place now.
Nice! How old is your nephew?
Thats good. Gotta build and maintain those family bonds. I should be doing the same once my nephew gets older.
That sucks. Can you make it up to her somehow?
At least those things come in sets so you can keep part of it?
It is a work award or something?
I am sure you are going to get it.
Why Thank you!
THanks for being so understanding!  I feel a little better now.
I know what you mean. Did you get the job?
I have not. What is it?
There are some bad parents out there thats for sure. Is it hard to be a parent?
Lol that is terrible. She should have changed his diaper before leaving the house what the heck...
That sucks. Maybe its time to get new friends?
Dont worry it will get better. I know you deserve better
I know exactly what you mean. My sister is entering her teenage years. I feel like its all I can do to just not be annoying to her so I cant even imagine what its like for a mom.
Thats good! All it takes is a good day once in a while to keep things on track until they get older. My mom just tries to be as patient and considerate with my sister so that she still feels motivated to communicate with her.
Ive never been to California.
That must of been terrible.
Did anyone help you?
Youre making me want to do the same thing. That sounds great!
Nothing like relaxing and getting your body ready for a night of good sleep!
Was it on the phone or in person?
What are you referring to?
That is nce
thank you for what?
youre welcome but for what?
ok then lol
Cool. Thats a fun hobby.
Well habe fun I guess.
Oh thats odd! Im sorry they didnt tell you what was going on. 
No problem! I hope so too. Good luck with that!
Who was your rep?
Aha. What was the association?
Did you got bored?
That is a very long drive! How long will it take to get there?
It must be very good if youre willing to go that far!
Wow youre very lucky. Do you share the facilities with other people?
Which part of the country are you in? Are you by the beach?
Was it recently? Happy Birthday
Oh goodness what happened for the past 3 weeks?
Oh I was thinking something bad happened.
Sorry to hear this! I can understand your pain. 
Take care of yourself and your family.
I am sure it will be fine do you have a preference
I am happy for you then
That is good it is very important to be loyal in a healthy relationship!
Good for you! I wish more people were like this unlike my ex! 
You should channel that envy into motivation!
Exactly be positive and you can buy one for yourself!
That is a great attitude to have!  It is great to have an optimistic approach to life.
I feel the same way.  We are a glass half full kind of people!
oh poor thing is she at least getting better?
haha that must be nice too though you get your own alone time for the most part!
I see you must have felt hopeful
Good one should always be positive
thats adorable how old is she? 
she sounds like it 
Thats a pretty heavy realization...better tell him now that regret it later
Best of luck to you
what are your options? 
oh yeah thats always going to be up and coming for sure 
It is an excellent opportunity to know other people and places to open up to the possibility I assure you that it will go to you very well
You do the same thing ... the opportunity is for both
That sounds like its rough did your father accept your apology?
Well Im sure he understands and you shouldnt feel too bad as long as you apologized youre fine.
it happens we have to reward ourselves sometimes. dark chocolate is actually good for you! 
hey it was just one day! you got this... work extra hard for the next 5 days! 
Im sure your supportiveness inspires him to work as hard as he does
I totally feel you on that. I swear my neighbors have to be the loudest at night slamming their car doors and yelling outside right in front of my bedroom window. 
My bedroom is first floor and literally maybe 4 feet from the parking lot. Lucky me. Lucky you tho too with animals. lol 
Did you retrace your steps
I used to lose stuff all the time.  Then I learned to relax and actively imagine all the places Id been to.  It worked for me then found a Gshock watch a pair of nikes and my wallet
thats great! I bet they are equally excited if not more  are you travelling alone?
oh i bet! you guys will have such a wonderful time together
I would be too that is a long time!
Wow that would make for a lonely timeframe
Wow did youcall someone about that?
Wow that sucks that is why I wanna live all alone!
Oh my did they notice you farted?
Must have rather awkward. Remember farting is just natural and I am sure she understands that.
I am sorry how have you been passing the time
I love video games you should buy a switch!
that is a very optimistic way to look at life . i should actually look at life that way too instead of getting overwhelmed when things do not go my way
how long have you looked at life this way? is it sustainable ?
this is completely true. it involves totally re conditioning the mind .
i would totally attempt it 
I am so very sorry. Have you had time to talk about it
thats good prayer can comfort maybe you should talk to your pastor
Ooh thats a big jump. I was considering the same thing but I one state above 
I put it on hold until I fly up there this year to check things out. Its quite a big decision and I would recommend going there for a while just to see what its like
Yes realistically I wish it were possible to do that everyday but general stresses of life get in the way 
Maybe thats a good idea to try and set aside a small amount of time a day to do it instead of trying to do it all the time along with everything else going on. Good idea!
Do you have any hobbies that may help you to meet people?
Same here.  Try to take advantage of your gaming and be more outgoing during gametime.
You must be ver
very excited.  oops.  Where did she go?
that sounds like fun where in the ozakrs?
Sounds like you made the right decision.  What a bunch of Aholes
Hm maybe she liked you ha
Free pizza is good! How did you get it?
It was fine how about you?
Im not sure I feel comfortable telling you as we just met.
My day was great so far!  How about you?
That is good to hear!  Im am sure you are grateful to experience such a good day!
Oh that sucks  Maybe organize the socks better?
Ah. Well chalk it up to one of those funny but awkward moments of life then!
Thats great! When will you find out?
I know how it feels to be homesick but you have to put your wife first.
You and your wife should go out to events and try to meet new people.
Ohh man that is a long time to be alone.  What are you going to do while she is gone?
Im sorry.  Where did she go?
What happened? Did someone bump on your car?
Be carefull  you dont know the cray people that is out there.
That must have been awkward.
Dont worry about it. It happens to the best of us.
Nostalgia can be wonderful cant it?
I feel the same when listening to 90s alternative music
What was going on!?
sounds like a lot of drama ugh i hope you get some rest tonight 
thats really good you feel pretty secure about it then?
oh wow then that is really good! For someone to say that! You should be very proud of yourself.
Thar was an embarasing moment for sure
Maybe you are felling lonely these days?
Did you have an enemy or someone as a suspect?
Weird reaction. I feel like he should just do his job and not key your car.
What are you worrying about?
Well I hope its alright heart problems is not something you should take lightly.
What is your favorite memory with your friends?
That sounds like so much fun! Im glad you got to go back to revisit.
You deserved for graduating.
Just keep working hard and make them proud.
Im glad to hear you have something you can lean on in hard times. Im personally an Atheist but I can respect someone with faith.
I absolutely agree. As long as you arent hurting anyone do whatever you please!
Oh man Im sorry to hear that! It doesnt necessarily mean it went bad though. Maybe they just had a more qualified candidate?
Keep your head up! Job hunting is usually stressful for most people. You got this!
Im not jealous of my coworker though?  What makes you think im jealous?
I didnt say that.
That would be sad do you keep him in a cage?
Thats nice what does he enjoy watching?
Absolutely. Although the world isnt so black and white. Sometimes a person may have to steal to survive. Is it really wrong then?
I agree. Stealing someone elses possession when it wasnt necessary for your survival is despicable! I hate a thief!
Thats so sad Im so sorry you had to go through that. How did it happen?
My goodness that sounds like a tragedy. Im sure she was a great dog friend of yours.
Do you have some big plans for the visit?
Uh oh have you ever delivered a baby before?
Oh right I am a doctor.
I am a baby delivering doctor!
What was the accomplishment again?
Wow thats amazing. What made her want to go back to school?
What about this homeless person had you reevaluating things?
Whats been bothering you at work? Are you not being fulfilled enough?
Oh no! I hope it didnt fall on anything or anyone!
Oh thats really nice! Its important to help each other out when things like that happen!
Who??? Male or female.Actor or singer?
Please tell me who she is!!!!!
I know exactly how you feel Ive been slipping back into paycheck to paycheck living recently. It was so much better when I had the money to pay for everything.
Hahaha yes you are so right. Then again Im a Christian so I am also comforted when I remember that we have a real more important and awesome life to look forward to one day.
Wow thats terrible. Was anything stolen or damaged?
What a story its just unbelievable how these robbers have absolutely no morals.
That is is awful.Did you call the cops
You should install security cameras outside your house.
Thats rough man. Got any back up interviews lined up?
I hope that you hear back from them soon. It aint going to be rough forever  someone has got to recognize your worth eventually!
Oh no that is terrible! What happened? What did you do!
I am so sorry that happened to you!
Yuck sounds like an unpleasant feeling. How do you even get hair up there!
Well at least she loves you. Maybe shoving all her hair up your nose is her way of telling you that.
Oh really?! Where you headed too?
Wow! Thats on the east side of Africa isnt it? 
Did you have a severe diarreia or something?
I am sure your friend will forgive you.
Oh cool! How did you win it? 
Oh cool! I love chess! What did you win? 
Wow thats annoying my husband is always telling me about his coworkers being the same way. 
Yeah I see what you mean. Hopefully he might realize eventually.
Sometimes it is uncomfortable to have to wait for something or someone.
Well a wise man said that having patience was a virtue I think youre becoming a more virtuous person by waiting.
I think you should always focus on your strength then it wont matter who is there and what they say
Also having at least one  friend in such meetings  would help. Next time  go with someone you know
Thats great how wonderful! I hope yall had a good time.
How great Im glad to hear that.
How old was the child?
Wow thats awfully young for that kind of thing.
Oh thats not good. It is hard to put all your effort in and have it go nowhere
Sometimes revamping leads to more amazing results than you could have orginially anticipated
Oh no! Are you going away this weekend?
Hopefully she answers soon. Maybe shes taking a nap or is in the shower.
I am in the same boat but I think that I can still be very happy and very content with the little bit of money or lack of I have. 
How funny! I know how you feel though. I have always been poor.
Happiness is within and I seek that all the time. Even rich people are sad and unhappy. 
Why? How did that happen?
Thats so sad. I feel sorry for you. 
Yeah. Do you have back up plans for this issue?
Thats nice Im glad you feel that way.
I do feel that way I try to always have a Christian attitude.
Thats nice of her! Its always good to have friends to fall on
Oh thats even better. Thats truly a friend you can rely on. Youre very fortunate.
Skateboarders have some serious skills! I can barely walk a straight line.
We all have different talents. Mine do not lie in those kind of stunts either lol! 
Maybe you could try to better that?
You could start a trend.
He will make it
It will help eventually
That must have been scary. It could have gone really badly.
I hope the owner knows better next time.
Oh man! I hear you. I rescue animals and it is VERY hard to potty train them!
For sure! It is much like potty training a kid. Actually I think dogs are easier then kids lol!
THat is stressful.  Are they ok?
That is really good to hear
I certainly do.  Lucky to be healthy and able
Good question.  I am thankful to be able to park my car in my garage!
I hope you get the job! What was the position you applied for?
That sounds like it pays nice?
No. Why do you ask?
Im sorry to hear that. How far along in the process are you?
I actually do not have any kids right now
I heard that was a really fun game though!
Seems like we all have. Some people shirk having to though.
Oh no.I hope she gets better.
Well thats good sometimes its our failures that really show us what were made of. 
Congratulations. I am in my twenties and still cant drive so hopefully I will get my license next year.
Did you say anything to someone?
a Burger King near me got shut down for that!
No I do not have kids. Yours?
I bet you were really proud!
Wow. Thats hard to believe lol.
Yeah it sounds that way.
That must of been a pain! I hate waiting in lines for cashiers they are so slow sometimes.
Stores should really open more checkouts when it is busy especially during rush our!
Man Im so jealous of you. I love that new puppy stage as tumultuous as it can be. Theres just so much emotion and new feelings going on as you watch it grow.
Yeah but then theres also those late nights where you have to take them out because theyre not used to holding their peepoop in. And also them peeing and pooping in the house as they learn not to do that to begin with. They just have unlimited energy so its hard to keep up sometimes but also fun!
What were simpler times?
Ah I see. Had a great childhood hu?
Congrats! That would be really exciting. What was your project?
Thats a very interesting topic. I would have loved to have seen that!
I know what thats like. I have three kids.
They never slept in the crib lol. I wont even make my son get a haircut because he cries so much when the clippers get close. Im the wrong one to come to for advice lol
That sounds heavenly
I envy you.  Have fun!
Time sure does fly and change is inevitable
Thinking about past events can be very nostalgic
time to find a new job it sounds like! good luck
Awesome! What is he in college for?
Holy goodness! That is really specialized. You should be very proud! 
That is very good to hear hopefully things truly turn around for him.
Not yet i just have one dog.
Oh thats neat! Did you find anything good?
Oh I remember when those came out and everyone thought they were going to be worth millions someday! 
Wow thats incredible. I dont even make my own bed. 
Of course... haha. Why doesnt anyone pay adults to make their beds?
Wow that sounds very disgusting.
I hope the baby rat is okay.
Im so sorry but great to hear she is better now!
Well Im glad to hear its resolved.
Oh thats nice I love doing that. Did the cat seem happy?
Well how nice that must have been fun.
Wow that must have been scary!
How long were you lost for?
Wow back up there friend what are you talking about?
Context what the heck are you talking about?
Seriously what the hell are you talking about??
Being jealous of another person is a perfectly fine response. Despite this you never know what is going on behind the scenes she may have taken out huge loans just to fund her trips.
I bet you would go on many vacations if you did the same as her. Instead you are being a responsible person and doing what is best for your future.
You just had a baby?! I didnt even know you were expecting!
Im so happy for you! Have you decided on a name yet?
Good for you! I have heard many great things about keto. How are you finding it?
Props to you for researching the diet without understanding how it works. Some people are just looking for ways to lose weight fast but putting in effort goes a long way.
You must be over the moon happy.
Very funny. Have you decided on a name yet?
Happy belated Birthday! Did it turn out the way you had hoped?
What did you get instead?
Really? That is a good move
You have As because you have high interest in studying  
Wow that is truly incredible! What is your secret?
That is so true! You are a true weight loss warrior I think!
Do you like it now?
I like 2 as well.  Its perfect for cereal and chocolate milk!
Have you tried 1?
Thats great.  2 is much more healthful than whole milk.
so very bad ya
Oh no!    How are you taking it?
Dang.  Please dont blame yourself.
Thats pretty long how did you manage?
Yea something calming helps during fraustrating moments but at least you know how the route is now
Nice! Whos Robby? Is that your husband?
Aha! Was it actually your anniversary today? Happy Anniversary!
Oh wow... um thats crazy. Why did you do that? 
I would imagine! Id do the same thing if I was your dad haha.
You sound like a caveman
Why you no hunt and send wife instead.
Oh I can relate to that especially if you are not prepared for it it can get really scary
You guys will be alright trust me I  experienced same with my partner and now we are fine. Our kid is a teenager now. I am happy for you guys
Oh no! Im not sure how all that works but I thought that was fairly normal for a pregnat woman
Well Im glad for you! And for him! A new life is exciting
Thats so sad. You did your best. How old was she?
Thats really good though. It sounds like you gave her a great life.
Was he with you or just someone you wanted to be with?
In that case you are better off without her. 
Oh wow I wish my parents had done that! It would have saved me from the mountain of debt I have now
Well Ive always been of the mindset that if they can they should help the first 2 years as thats usually the breakin period. After that the child should be able to manage
I bet that felt good to get out and experience that!
Oh I am sorry to hear that. I also enjoy dogs. They are one of lifes great joys in my opinion.
You should take a vacation that will help you relax and see new stuff
Oh ok. In that case let someone very close like your mother come around to help you out. Having someone to talk to helps in times like this
Thats awesome. Are you using any special types of lotion?
Ill have to do the same! I wish my skin looked better than it does.
You must be wealthy. I would love to visit NYC
OMG! I know how you feel
Oh me too! I love digging out my N64 and SNES from time to time.
Yes that Yamaha sound chip was magical. We call it the Genesis over here.
Wow that must have been a terrible experience.
so very nice.your doughter.
whove very nice ya and super talent.
What does what mean exactly?
Well whatever went wrong I hope it can be fixed somehow.
Oh no! Did you take the kitten to an animal hospital or care for it yourself?
Awe thats a sweet story! The kitten got a happy ending!
Thats great! Who did the travelling?
She must be a strong woman.
Oh no. I hope you got somewhere safe while it was going on.
Thats good at least. Living in an area with tornados is so scary!
Oh that is fantastic! I bet your brother was pretty happy too.
That is very sweet. I think they will have a happy and lasting marriage.
Thats exciting! What kind are you looking for?
Ah. Hopefully something with good gas mileage!
OK have you done the need full?
OK get started already. A stich in time saves nine  !
Oh I think I can guess which retailer youre talking about. Ive had so many problems with them over the years
I know. Canada isnt even overseas in the literal sense its just over the border!
Unbelievable. You must be very angry with her whoever she is.
Neither would I I dislike such greedy people 
Wow that must have been frustrating.  I hope it didnt cost too much.
I know how that is.  At least you have your car back!
Im sorry to hear that. It sounds very rough. What happened to it?
Oh jeez thats really awful. Can you get it back?
What didnt she like?
Well that makes sense.
Congrats you have a baby on the way
How many kids do you want in total?
Oh no. How did you handle having two such big priorities come up?
Oh sorry to hear. I am sure your child was glad you were home. Is she or he feeling better now?
The club isnt a great place to find the right kind of girl anyways.  
This somehow seems inappropriate.
What is your plan to accomplish that? 
Just dont over do you have to enjoy being a parent thats a key to happy kids.
Did you spill something?
Was it liquid ?
What was brutal?
Really? No shower for few days?
ok. I understand 
i would feel terrible to thats really bad you should just tell her and change! 
The truth can set us free probably better for her and you both. 
Sorry to hear that... they say time heals everything but i disagree its been 9 years for me and it still feels like yesterday. How long for you? 
Im really sorry for your loss! I hope that someday it gets better for the both of us. 
Oh I love seeing kids achieve things! Adorable. Good for her!  
I am sure I would be too of my daughter. You sound like an awesome parent. 
oh.. well i understand. but that was a long time ago right?
come clean to them about any major lies youll feel better 
haha.. i feel you. my mom feels the same way
Amen sister! women always keep things in check
thats really good of you. she is a lucky gal
haha.. i guess she was not as good as your girl huh?
Oh no Im sorry to hear that. Are you considering getting a new dog?
I understand mine just turned 15 and Im not looking forward to that day.
Jeez people just always have to be in a hurry to get no where right. 
people are just selfish and only consider their own lives! 
That is pretty cool! What made you want to become a lawyer?
Great! I know it can be a tough job I am sure you will do fine keep studying!
Well there are plenty more girls out there
Oh no. Did you leave?
Like you had a different kind of accident lol
Honestly that sounds pretty fun to me I havent been to bingo in years. I love listening to the older people arguing when someone wins. 
hope you feel better
it was fine. How about you?
Too hot for anything
as you should
ohh good luck!
Oh thats great what are the animals?
Oh wow I love hippos and I dont know what sloth look like will let google help me out 
Maybe? Is it that big of a deal to you?
Meaning you have been happier before or you are more happy now than you have been?
Oh wow thats great! I would be very happy too!
oh its hurts a little
Me too! Have you ever been to one of them races?
Oh cool do you live in the city?
That is awesome!  Is there a particular reason you are so happy?
That is something to be happy about!  Congratulations!
That is an exciting purchase! What kind did you get?
That is a nice car! I know you are enjoying that!
That was such a nice thing to do! She seems very caring!
That is so nice that she made note that you had been wanting it for so long! 
That is SO exciting! I remember how that felt!
That will come! The hardest part is over now!
The company you work for is horrible. They should have gave you that time off because it was a family emergency.
Ew that is not good! I wouldnt have been able to stay and eat.
I do not blame you!
that is awesome i feel the same when i drive by my grandparents old home
yes i was
That is exciting! I love having pictures to look back on. 
I love being able to reminisce on the past. Time goes by so fast. 
I had Hurricane Matthew come through where I live too! NE FL I know how you feel only I couldnt get gas for my car because there was no gas anywhere!
Yeah you thought ahead me not so much. Our house was fine but a HUGE mess to clean up in the yard and no power for 2 days. I hope your house was ok too!
Was it a checkup or did you have some health issue?
Did everything go well or do you not know yet?
Oh man I bet that is fun
No I have always wanted one though
Was it someone you know? Sorry for your loss if it was.
Im sorry did you get to see her a lot before she passed?
Omg! That is terrible. They should really be considerate of peoples time
Right. Did he at least apologize for the long wait
Wow! I would write a review and choose another doctor who actually cares about his patient!
Good luck! What is it on?
How much studying did you do leading up to it?
Oh man I bet that will be fun
I have I love going when I can
Thats really nice of him! How long have you been married?
Well you made the right choice in man to marry lol. What kind of necklace?
That either sounds like a locket or a heart shaped key. Am I close at all?
Cool I think I saw a commercial for that actually.
Ut oh.. what happened?
hehehe.. dont mind if I giggle do you?  You need to remember... dont feel embarrassed bout silly stuff like that.  Those people dont know you or really care.  They laugh like I did because its fun to see things happen to other people that we fear. 
What are you going to do about it
Well be careful for sure
I am sorry to hear that. Have you ever talked to your parents about that?
Yes you do.Otherwise you are going to carry that pain the rest of your life.
That is great that your hard work has paid off.
Now you having something to celebrate. Congrats!
Dont worry anyone would have felt the same way. If it makes you feel better remember that we were all babies once.
Yeah thats important did you have music you could have listened to or something?
Loyalty is a good thing
Oh wow that is loyalty for sure
I wish I had a grandma.. did she send you anything extra?
That is still really sweet.  I never knew any of mine.  Treasure her while you can!
Wow must have been rather frightening. Glad you are ok!
I hope you have all the emergency essentials you need for next time.
Gardening can be peaceful
Nature is a wonderful thing
Oh how exciting!  What do you have planned?
I bet she is going to be so surprised!  Is she hard to surpise?
Well Im sure everything will go great!
yeah thats tough. But can you imagine how bad you might feel if he had a REALLY good time on the date and really thought things were going somewhere with the two of you?
That is true. Either way it seems like he definitely got the hint. 
Oh wow I have heard that can happen with that food
Ha that is funny
ewww! that is just super gross dude!
Oh man that is just crazy! Feel bad for the person who has to clean it.
I would love to have that tv
Keep it the guilt will go away
Women these days. I dont think ill ever understand them.
Exactly sometimes I think women like drama.
It must have been fun to catch up with them.
Well I hope you guys continue to stay in touch.
Going to college is a good thing but taking classes in the summer can really stink. At least youll get to graduate sooner.
That is the craziest thing I have ever heard.
Thats awesome. What are you going to do about it?
Im envious. Do you have any idea of what those plans are?
oh i know friends like those
i believe you
Oh wow sounds dangerous. Were you able to stay home and not venture out in it?
Did you have any damage to your home?
Thats really sad. Is there a cure for Lupus?
I am sorry about that. Is it contagious?
When did you get separated? By the way that is terrible to hear.
Why are you so down my depressed friend?
Uh oh!  What did it end up coming from?
Yuck!  Clean that up quick so it doesnt grow mold!
I hate to hear that what happened that made it end poorly?
maybe you can plan another trip together soon  sounds like you guys need some time to reconnect and just truly enjoy each other.
Leave a note on their door. and at the end put thanks in advance lol
Well you can at least try. 
You could get earplugs lol
Oh man! What happened to your hip?
Oh my god..I had doctors really mess me up too. I am in a lawsuit. Have you thought about contacting an attorney?
If its medical malpractice actually you can get a good amount. Mine is still in talks its only been 6 months. Medical malpractice lawyers usually take you on for free if they like your case  You can always try and you wont be charged if you dont win. Its pretty painless..people killed my child and almost me..
Thank you! I hear you..I didnt want to do it at first...but its worth it for her..Its a few people I am suing.including midwives. If it prevents another childs death then its worth it! You should really look in too it botched surgery and nerve pain can be horrible! I hope you get better!
Are you looking forward to the weather this weekend?
Nice! Mowing the lawn isnt fun in the heat unless youre using a super fast one of course
I agree the writing part is easy part but the speaking part is the worst!
Maybe so they say to imagine the crowd naked but I dont think that helps too much with the writing part.
Same. What are your favorites?
Thats funny. Ive also seen Trolls about 100 times. My daughter is now sick of it!
Ive noticed a lot of the newer kids movies have adult jokes in them.
Yeah maybe that... they are also lazier.
Yeah I get that. Where did you work?
Oh yum. Not a terrible place to work!
Yes  work is better with friends.
Really? Im surprised the only restaurant in town wasnt busy.
Did you see that happen today?
Thats pretty cool.  What a nice person.
Whoa!  What were you driving that had no brakes?
That sounds quite scary!  Did everything turn out OK?
Haha!  Awkward.  What did you do?  Did you hurry up and get out of there?
Same here.  I would rather just leave the situation.
Congrats. I want a promotion at my job.
I think Im just going to move on.
Oh wow! What are you going to buy with all that sweet loot? Firecrackers?
That sound like a wise decision. I think I would just get a blow up doll instead.
Cool. Does that get a bonus?
Well now you know youre pretty great at your job.
Was he upset?
I hate when that happens. 
I hate ggrocery shopping period. Too many decisions
You are so right.
Maybe you should let him get a couple of things to make up for it.
Or you can get a variety pack!
Thats nice. I could get that here.
Well now you know.
Noice!  What was it about?
Very cool are you a scientist?
Oh no! Thats awful.  Or maybe a good thing if he wasnt good for you.  How are you feeling?
I bet.  It can be brutal with the change and not having someone but you have to trust yourself that you are doing the right thing.  Its a good time to grieve your time together and then move on and find yourself again.
Congratulations!  That is amazing!  You must be a hard worker.  What do you do?
Thats an important job though!  Youre keeping things running smoothly for that business to thrive.  Im so happy for you.  Money is tight for me so when I hear someone getting a bonus...it just makes me so happy for them to get that added chunk of money!
I wish I could relate. Im a male so Ill never know the pain andor the reward that comes with growing a human being inside your body. Its such an impressive thing to go through and no matter what mothers will never get enough credit. You deserve serious props. What ages are they now?
Yeah Ill consider it. Thats a nice thought. My brothers have had 5 kids between them so I have plenty of nieces and nephews to deal with in the meantime and theyve given me lots of practice but Im grateful for that. 15 and 19 thats awesome. Youre almost all the way through getting both of them to a stage where your job becomes a little easier.
It what?  Its way higher?  If thats what you meant to finish with then I totally feel you.  Especially during the summer with the air conditioning running so much.  
It is ridiculous.  I found out how they measure power that people use in their houses and it doesnt even sound fair to me.  It averages things because it cant specifically tell. 
Wow school is right around the corner
Well that should relieve some stress
Everyone has those kinds of days it happens
I am sure they have forgotten about it
Why not? What was wrong?
Aww Im sorry. Thats a bummer.
It sounds very motivational.
He must be a great speaker.
What are you saving for?
I am sure everything will be fine. Do not stress.
I hope you did well on it.
Just hope for the best and dont worry.
Thats great!  Im happy for you.
What are those things?
That sounds so exciting! Congratulations!
It sounds like you live in a great community.
Oh man. Hopefully things are different now and you have the confidence that you need!
Nothing like taking it out on the weights and gaining the muscles in return! 
I understand that. I am the same way.
I cannot function if I eat anything other than my usual breakfast.
Unfortunately I have very little discipline. Im probably too addicted to carbs to get fit very quickly. 
wow. When that happened?
Sorry to hear that. I hope your insurer will call you back soon.
It is unacceptable. I hope he did not get cold as a result of this
That is pretty sad and heartbreaking to see kids in such situations
Do you have plans to get together? 
How nice of her. You must have been so happy to see her.
There are usually many ways but it depends on what you want to do!
Well we all want to work from home but it takes a lot of work and sweat to make that a reality for most of us
That is so exciting.  what have you done to prepare
the buggy is important  I have a baby boy of my own.
Do you have a baby one the way?
do you make enough money to support the baby?
oof that is rough.
those foids deserve it.
Yes you only hurt yourself when you get angry.
Give it some time maybe shell change her mind.
thats so sweet of you
oh yea i can imagine glad shes fine
Wow. Do you expect to win?
That is nice. Good luck.
Nice me too are you playing Nintendo games?
I remember these game well like Contra and Battle Toads. 
Was it your first time riding on one? Is there something in particular that makes you afraid?
Was it your only choice to get where you were going?
Great what make are getting?
Toyota is reliable are getting an SUV?
Interesting choice. Did she like it?
Thats good to have something in common. Make the memories.
So what is the problem exactly?
Try doing something you never did before.
It is disgusting. What did you do?
You did good. You should have called the manager to tell him know.
There are so many bike trails available now. You are going to have a lot of fun.
Im glad you were able to get one that you are going to enjoy so much.
Thats a big step. I hope it works out for you.
I like renovation projects. And yes renting is a waste of money
I feel you Im in the same boat.  Are you in a two income household?
Yep money spent on bills and food with little left for fun.  My wife has the same complaint. 
Oh no that sounds horrible
I am sorry that is a sad thing to go through
Why would you not get paid?
I can imagine it is
Oh my did it make you emotional?
Aw hopefully you never lose that picture!
Oh what was the surprise?! 
You should go on a little date if you can. or to the movies!
You should have taken a Uber. You never know what will happen these days.
No problem. Its also worth carrying a taser or pepper spray.
did you pay him back?
thats good thetn
Oh my so close! But you can try better next time.
Yes and theres no point mulling over it! 
wow thats crazy.. what ended up happening!
wow thats good
aww.. that must have been a sweet nostaligia. did you had a collection of those?
I feel happy for ya! I used to collect cards myself i still have them
That is great! Did you manage to land the job?
Im glad to hear that! As long as you keep working hard and trying your best you can do it! 
Are you talking about the city or a person?
I didnt know this broadway show but it seems nice.
Yeah I love going to the beach as well! You must have felt so happy there in that moment!
I feel happy and content just sitting here listening to you describe the experience.
oooh no thats awful

That sound amazing.  Dancing is very bonding.
Well a night out dancing will go a long way towards reconnecting with the love of your life.  I am happy for you!

I feel you it would be really scary. How did it turn out?
so happy for you!
Damn! was it a stray dog?
Dear god.. I hope you are alright my friend!
Oh really? I believe you wanted to be a singer yourself huh?
Well it is never too late my friend.. pursue your dreams 
Did they follow your instructions or did they do their own thing?
Wow!  I didnt expect that answer from you!  That must have been a great surprise!
Oh god.. thats so gross
I would have thrown up right then and there
i was beet red when I realized what had happened.
Thank you your so kind
Is she staying with you ? 
Sounds like everything went better than expected.
Oh dear me.. So sorry to hear that! what did you do?
I really hope things work out for you my friend
Disgusting. Was it the flying variety?
Gross.  We have those here too.  Typically you only see them during the summer.
good for you! that is how it is supposed to be
I wish you the very best on that my friend
i feel like is should be prepared
oh sorry to hear that.. why didnt it work out?
Aw.. i feel you my friend. Hopefully things get better soon enough
What did you lie about and why?
Best advice.  Never confess it.
Damn! Every kid tells such innocent lies.. I bet your were embarassed
Aww.. Your story is both cute funny and innocent
Did you give her one of each?
aweeee that is pretty cute.
Shoot.. I bet it was scary.. How did you handle it?
So glad to hear that buddy. Wishing you are your girl all the very best
Have you been applying to try to get a position?
Thats unfortunate.  What are you doing now?
Thankfully they just were checking up on my speed

Hope you feel better
Uhm.. yeah sure. I concur!
Oh yeah me too. They have such cool attitude

Hahaha.. I am sorry i know it was really scary but to think about it now it is really funny as well
Nice.. what type of ticket.. Monopoly?  Price is Right?  Scrabble?  Bingo?
Better luck next time!  I love to scratch!
That sounds gross did you get sick from it?
Smart move at least you noticed it and it wasnt hidden under icing or anything
Oh god.. sorry.. How are you holding up?
Sorry buddy.. hopefully she is at a better place
losing a loved one is never easy  especially a brother im sorry for your loss
I cant imagine the pain you went through i have 7 brothers and the taught of losing one of them scares me
I hear ya. Both sides are infected with this issue. 
Well they are looking for more viewers. It is not news anymore it is entertainment.
That is nice. They are good at that age. I have a 20yearold and he is currently ignoring me.
I understand that. I tried to give him a new table for his apartment and he blatantly ignored me. I was like well I dont have to give it to you.
That blows dude  i bet it was not your fault 
So they just cleaned house ? Damn that bad  i would assume they would have kept some workers 
I thought walmart was pretty cheap.  Ive never been to aldis
I may need to see if I have one near by.
I know right? everyone is with Lebron James coming in
So true. Lakers going to do well this time around.
Oh god.. so sorry to hear that. May i ask how did it happen?
Sorry.. Hopefully he is at a better place now.
Aww such a nice boyfriend in this day and age! She is so lucky.
I assure you she is a keeper. Marry her buddy!
Good I hope you make the ends meet
I wish you the best of luck you will be fine!

Ouch.  What kind of dog?
Im not a very good dancer.  What kind of dancing did you do?
Oh wow that does sound fun
Well if you are willing to try steroids then you might have a chance of winning. Without it it is impossible to even participate
Well in those contests you have to be really pumped and by just fruits and vegetables it is very unlikely
For work when i got a new job
Im so sorry.  You have my deepest condolences. Its hard to not feel isolation with the death of someone you are close to.  I can tell you it does get better and you are not alone.  He lives on in you.
Take joy and pride in the memories you have of him.  They are your personal family movies in your mind.  Cherish them because not everyone gets them with their parents.  Its good to find support and counseling too if you need it. Take care of yourself.
Yeah i know that feeling. how did you handle it?
Good for you buddy  happy for ya
Big houses are a pain in the neck to keep clean.
It does have its benefits.
damn thats sick and rough.. He knew you guys were together?
Cant say he did not deserve that..
Thats wonderful!  I do too.  I dont take it for granted because Ive been battling Lupus for 13 years and in bed a lot.  Its an amazing world we have! What is on of your favorite things to do outside?
Sounds wonderful!  I really want to take up gardening.  It would go with my new lifestyle Ive adopted of eating plant based.  Do you have tips for a beginner?
The rap version?   Doesnt sound all that appealing to me.  Was it that good?
Maybe ill have to check it out
how did that go
oh thats awesome.. congrats
Optimism is the faith that leads to achievement 
for faith there is no path it is an individual humans thought 
I am not I am still young
I hope so I am still not sure if I want kids
I have anxiety attacks too  you feel like you cant catch your breath and you are light headed.
that is crazy  Its only usually a few minutes for me before I can talk myself down.
Dont worry. It will be okay. Flights are always safe
Its natural. Do not sweat it.
That will be such a wonderful feeling when you do. I know its hard when you see someone reach the finish line first  are you able to turn that envy into inspiration?
See? Thats terrific! And shes got to love that you can celebrate her victories too  even more inspiration to support yours!
Im like that too so I can totally relate. Were you able to talk to him about how you felt?
Ive felt the same way. As I have aged and become more comfortable and secure in my marriage and in myself those other insecurities and fears dropped off. Good for you for conquering that challenge!
Oh that must be exciting! I bet you were busy making preparations.
That sounds like it was a lot to take in! Congrats to them!
wow.. what do you plan to do ?
Oh really? How did it go?
Great job! Im so happy for you! Losing weight is hard!
That sounds exciting! Congratulations to her. I bet there was a lot of celebration to be had for such an achievement!
I bet! But at least now like you said she can see what hard work can achieve. Hopefully the path continues in the best way possible and she can get everything you both hoped for!
Did that person betrayed you in any way?
Dont be so hard on yourself for being a frien and trust another people.
I love reuniting with old friends helps me remember and appreciate the good times.
I bet that was a long time ago!
Im sure you studied hard and should be proud of that! Im positive you nailed it.
Being competitive isnt a bad thing unless you let it get in the way of your personal life. 
How did you meet your friend?!
College and high school friends are always close to the heart. Im glad she lives fairly close!
That is unfortunate. I hope that it is able to be treated well.
I hope it goes as smooth as possible. Hang in there.
Wait were they leaving to go somewhere or like dying? Either one is a little sad to be honest.
Its like losing a family member 
What happened to him? Are you guys roommates?
That is very bad. Unemployed individual can be very frustrating to deal with
How did they lose so much weight compared to you?
Maybe it has something to do with your diet ?
Getting out of town and way from all of everday lifes struggles always sounds like a great time.  Did you leave you cell phone at home while you weer away to really get away from everything for a minute?
That sounds like a really relaxing time Im jealous.
No refunds for a cancel 1 week before? That sounds like a total scam! I would be furious. Did you ever find a way to get your money back? Because that does not sound legal!
I hope that you win your money back and then some you really deserve it after all of that upset!
Lovely.  What did you do together?
Sounds like a great time.  What has brought that memory back up again
That must feel lonely.  You should go out and try to meet some people!
Good deal!  Hopefully then you wont feel so alone!
That is frightening! especially if you didnt know whether it was a harmful spider or not! What did you do?
Oh so you were able to get that spider away from you! Good job hopefully that wont have to happen to you again!
Wait summers already over? Next summer?
Oh really? I thought summer ended after July. You learn something new everyday lol
You should get a mini fridge and put it in your room with a lock on it.
Yea man go for it dont procrastinate.
Wow that truly is devastating. I wish your family can make it through these hard times 
If my sister died to breast cancer I would be so depressed to the point of my health deteriorating too. 
Amen to that.Life is so unfair its not even funny.
Life is so complex.We had no idea of the design of that
What is the state and do you like change?
Oh that is all the way into the cold and wet wild! Do you have or will you think of getting sled dogs?
lol right. You will have great fun!
I agree!  Things look really good going forward.
I hope so as well especially for my kids sake!
Im sorry to hear that  i hope she can find a way stop this before she spirals out of control
She really does need an intervention  and family and friends would help greatly  i hope she can get her life back together 
Oh my god thats excellent! Congrats!
Oh lol. Did you get to see any sharks at the aquarium?
Oh cool yes that is very interesting. So how big were those whales in feet and the baby too?
I know how you feel! What did you watch?
It is a pretty good horror.
That is very impressive. She going to make sooo much money
Any employer would hire someone who went to Harvard in a heartbeat. You are a lucky parent!
Nice what kind of car is it they purchased?
Ok that is a nice car what color is it?? 
That is excellent what did you major in?
Oh cool. Do you want to work as a scientist?
Sorry to hear about that.  I wonder if theres any way to fix this situation.  What do you plan to do?
Coming clean is a great way to start.  Its hard since you know shell be hurt.  Were you having trouble in the relationship before?
When is the last time you seen them?
Thats awesome I hope yall have a good time!
Do you still talk with any of your older friends?
Do you have little time from working or other things?
Yikes what was it about?
creepy.  Were you able to fall asleep after watching it?
Thats great. I bet it is a very special place for you two.
Sounds like a nice little place. I am glad you two have that spot to share.
at least Riley passed in their sleep. Hopefully they didnt suffer. im sorry you lost a loved one.
i have a big doofy mutt who is a 75 lb lap dog in his heart. i know the feeling
I absolutely agree. I really hope he doesnt win in 2020.
Hes like an angry child trying to make everything about himself!
Dang that sucks. MAybe they can visit you instead?
Ah gotcha. Well I hope you heal fast!
I guess you dont live in Alabama? Was it overall a good trip....or challenging? Or both!
Well if the drive was the most challenging it sounds like a good trip! Too often its family dynamics that are more challenging  and not so easily taken care of. 
That is the worst!! I know that you must have been very frustrated with your teammate.
There have been a number of times where this has happened to me too. I hope that doesnt happen to you too much in the future!! 
I hate bees and wasps so much. Maybe you should call pest control?
That sucks I hope you get it figured out!
wow it must have been quite an experience
My prayers are with you buddy. Stay safe
Awesome. What breed did you own?
I love paints and growing up we had 2 quarter horses that my dad used for calf roping.
10 minutes is a good time to be able to change a tire. I do not think I could change a tire own my own. 
Practice makes perfect or makes you fast in your case.
I would be too! Did you to it?
So did you regret doing it? Or were you super proud that you did? 
You must be so proud!
I dont think youre being selfish youre doing your best!
What state are you going to move to?
Oh that is nice will you be going skiing?
Who doesnt..  everyone should do it!  Have you ever had any mystic experiences while you did it?
I hear you can travel to different dimensions while meditating..
It must have being terrifying!
Tnank god! They should have let you know they where going to do the job.
Thats terrible. People need to learn to commit to their promises.
I dont understand how so many people value emotion over logic and reason!
oh that is nerve wracking. What did you try to do to cope?
Better living through chemistry! Im glad you made it through.
That is really nice of him.  Did the other people get mad because they had to wait?
Lucky you.  Where I live people are not so nice.  Can I move there?
I am in Central FL... so uhh.
Ouch I would try and wear something on your neck next time you go in there.
Hmm wear something thick and long. Maybe hockey pads!
But at least you lucked out and they brought it back!
Ah I know what you mean! And remember yearning to be older?! And of course the adults in our lives were shaking their heads thinking the way we are now 
As long as you keep your playful spirit youre in good shape! Sometimes it takes work to hold that awareness but I can see it in you!
Its awesome to have a job where you feel rewarded through what you do. What do you do?
That sounds like a lot of fun its so rewarding to have a position where you can engage with other people. You really seem motivating and inspiring so Im happy you have that job!
What did you do after waiting for 2 hours?
Silver linings do happen maybe is was a good thing your friend forgot about you.
Maybe not a true friend after all.
I bet. How much did she win and did she offer to share?!
Thats a lot of money to me anyway. Perhaps shes got a lot of debt to pay off or perhaps she has kids to take care of?
Good job! You must have worked hard and prepared. Or are you just naturally really smart?
Well done! You should be proud.
If Im understanding you correctly theyre going to clean it up right?
Wow thats fantastic news indeed! How long has it been derelict?
What did they or the person do to you?
Broom would be a good choice hit them in the crotch that will stop them.
Thats sweet. Im sure she will adjust in time. Have you ever personally had to make a move like your daughter did?
No I never have. Ive always lived in my state I was born in. However I did travel to Utah which was about 1200 miles away and got a bit homesick so I can relate.
Oh no! I hate speaking in front of crowds. What happened?
I know you probably feel like you did a bad job but I bet you did so much better than you think! Be proud of yourself for having the nerve to speak in front of others!
Honking is a way to communicate. In some countries they honk just to let another driver they are there.
Going too slow can be just as dangerous as going too fast. Especially in the fast lane!
That awesome! Congratulations! You should be very proud of yourself!
Yes I have! Its a great feeling when all of your hard work pays off! Best of luck to you!
There is a big storm coming where I am living now. Did your power go out?
Oh I will. Also wanted to let you know that if your power does go out to be aware that this is when they come out to play!
I know!  I was just watching his show on Netflix!  So sad especially since he had a little girl he is leaving behind.
I agree.  He had so much to live for.  I guess it is hard to know what demons people are hiding inside.
That is good. Did you have a good time with your supervisor?
Good job! Maybe you will get a promotion too!
Which way are you feeling? Are you a thrill seeker?
Yeah I really like Six Flags. They have some great roller coasters. Have fun tomorrow!
Keep it up. Soon youll have enough money to buy a new house.
Exactly it feels great when your prepared for the unexpected.
Thats fun. Will anybody be dressing as Santa?
Maybe you could pay someone to come into your house as Santa! And all the kiddies will be amazed!
that happened to me one. i had an american bulldog that had seperation anxiety and tore up my sofa cushions once. it was like a fluffy murder scene when i got home.
oh no. right now you are going crazy but it will be funny like you said in the future.
What types of tv shows do you like to watch?
Do you keep the tissue close whenever your are on the tv?
Ive been to Busch Gardens before.  They have some really cool Roller coasters.  I hope you have a great time.
Ive been to the one in Tampa.  They have this new coaster that rotates forward and backward and spins around. It was equal parts fun and scary.
Yea I agree. Or they just really dont care.
Did he even hesitate?
What a little monster!
Dogs are the best. are they ok?  what kind of medicine do you have to give them?
Awww golden retrievers are adorable.  My ex had one of them.  Well I hope your dogs feel better soon.  Ear infections are no fun at all.
Thats intense! I hope the damage wasnt all that bad.
Yes get it fixed as soon as possible. Does insurance cover it?
Wow you remember your friends from grade school? Maybe if I saw them again those memories would come back.
Well I hope you had a really great time. It sounds like you probably did!
That sounds like fun do you have a big family?
Yes I understand I have a big family so its hard for us to all get together at the same time.
Ive never been to one of those.  Is she really young or is she like a professional dancer?
thats awesome.  I wish I would have taken dancing lessons when I was younger.  Im a horrible dancer
yea youre right.  Maybe ill look into some classes and give it a shot
Aw thats so nice of him! Does he live far away?
Thats a great son. Its always nice to be able to rely on people close to you to help out when needed
Yeah I have had that experience. One was so bad I left before getting another job. Dont recommend doing that lol.
Stick it out until you have a backup. Your bank account will thank you!
Gross. It would have gone straight into the trash here.
You can use baking soda to get the smell out of it.
That sounds wonderful! What type of store is it?
I love that! It must be so much fun to curate the types of things that go in to the store. Do you help out or work there?
Im sure she loves having both your presence and your support!
Wow I cant imagine how you felt living in Hong Kong. That would take some serious adapting.
I am so happy that you found that expat community. I have often thought about moving abroad and Im glad that you adapted well.
I think I might. It sound exciting and I thank you for the encouragement.
Thats unfortunate but Im happy that you have a good support network to help you out.
I hope you recover well and Im sure you will with good support by your side.
I completely understand that. Did something like that happen recently? 
Yes I know how you feel. All we can do is encourage friends to join us in helping to make a difference. I believe there is hope!
Wow thats a good amount of time. Is he usually so secretive?
Ah maybe he just wanted to make sure it was going to work before he told anyone. 
It should be harder to get a license than it is.
Its as if some people think they are the only ones on the road.
Oh my gosh Im so sorry. May I ask how long ago it was that she passed? 
They probably still just need some time. My grandfather still isnt over the passing of my grandmother and that was over a year ago. I would just make sure to keep seeing and talking to your parents to make them feel as loved as you can.
Please dont ever give up. I would definitely work harder to find a job by networking with friends that have jobs in different places.
Go ahead and post your resume on as many job related forums that you can. I think its great that youre trying to find other ways of making money too. You are a gogetter and dont ever give up!!
That is awesome. Do you know what she wants to study?
As long as it is something she enjoys. I am sure you are very proud of her!
it has been really busy even for me at work  i feel your pain
I know right ? unfortunately for us those are the perks of growing up lol
Oh I dont think I could do that. I have a fear of falling from high places. 
I think I would pass out from fear lol.
I think the chances I take should be directly proportionate to the consequences of the actions.
That is interesting. Do you miss meat or dairy at all?
That is good to hear. I wish you the best of luck with your new diet.
I have to trust my doc completely that he has steady hands and will inject the nerve correctly.
Thats terrible to hear. Were you eventually able to be there?
Thats great news. I dont know what I would do if my mom passed.
Me too. Im glad everytihng worked out in the end for you.
Not very often. She lives about 7 hours away driving time.
Those cars are pretty slick what color was it?
Wow one day I hope to have enough money for a car like that thats awesome
UGH my dog has destroyed all of my favorite shoes.
I dont really like dogs for that reason.  They are fun to pet but taking care of them is a chore.
That sounds like you have a great wife.  What did she make you?
Yummy You are making me hungry.  Happy belated birthday!
I always love pizza!
when that happened to me i watched a lot of movies  for some reason the sad movies made me cry but just be strong and patient one day you realize you can do better or find someone new
it happens to the best of us and i totally understand where your coming from  spend some time with your friends or loved ones 
What did he cook that is such an exciting way to spend your day with your papa.
That sounds so delicious I would have loved a plate of that food any deserts 
Congratulations! Sounds like youre ready for the new position.
What is your work area?
That is so exciting! Such a fun time in life to watch them discover new things and always be such a surprise with what you didnt know that they already knew! ha ha thats a tongue twister.
I do!  An 8 year old daughter and 5 year old son.  They are my life as well so I totally get what youre saying.  How old is your daughter?
Oh wow I hope you have fun
Happy Birthday!!!!  Did you have a nice time?
I love sushi.  Did you get a spicy Tuna Roll?
Sounds good.  You have some generous parents.
Very nice wind in your hair exercise and fresh air.  Did you have a good time?
I am actually home bound but I love to live through other peoples experiences.  My wife and kids go out and bring back stories of their adventures.  I love it!
I know how you feel.  I moved away from my family and friends this summer.  Do you have family nearby at all? I often feel lonely when Im watching a movie by myself but then I remind myself that Im loved by a lot of people.
You are so strong!  Please thank your husband for his service and thank you for being his support no matter the miles between you.  Take care of yourself and get out with friends when you can!
You sound like youre embracing life!
Where did you move to?  I feel you. I am in the same place.  Just reversed 13 years of Lupus suffering by going plant based and now I want to live and see the world! I would love to move to Italy.
Oh wow Id be really jealous of him.
Well hopefully you can get yourself a better car soon.
I have one younger brother but he is old enough to drive on his own
Its always nice to catch up
I hope you keep doing thaty
Same here. I actually moved to the other side of the USA and I do miss my home
Not as often as I would like. Air travel is expensive after all. I know exactly what you mean though!
Were you happy about that or creeped out?
Youre a good guy. Did she take it well?
Thats really awesome that you supported your friend!
Im sure he really appreciated you support too!
Aw Im sorry. I know this isnt the best solution but have you considered listening to funny podcasts?
No problem! I know you cant always fix everything but its worth trying wierd ideas every now and then
Oh wow I love that kind of sauce
That isnt long at all
It is always good to keep our skills up to date. We never know. It could also help for a promotion also.
I hope you get your promotion.
Oh man your life is about to get so much more hectic. I feel for you. When my first was born I was just as pumped full of naivety and positivity. I felt like I could take on anything coming my way. I was exhausted after two weeks. Its such a long ride until theyre able to even remotely look after themselves.
I know you have a lot of work ahead of you but Im sure it will be a rewarding feeling that will be unmatched for the rest of your life. As a man I cant imagine what youll have to go through or what you will enjoy but I really commend all women everywhere for the strength they give when having a child.
Did it scare you?
Yes a little bit. When I was young I didnt like that much scary movies.
Well for me in the NFL I like the Cowboys and college its Alabama too.
Thats pretty cool. I bet its pretty difficult to do something like that.
Id love to watch people do tricks like this in person myself but Im not sure if theres any locations near me.
Aw I am sorry that happened to you. I hope the repair didnt cost you too much! 
Ah I see. Something similar happened to my brother too recently while he was picking me up so we were stuck at a coffee shop parking lot for several hours. 
Well at least you put in the effort. What grade did you end up receiving on this test?
Thats great! Hard work pays off I guess.
Oh Im sorry.  How are his family doing?
Its pretty hard to deal with.  One of my friends buddies died in a car crash as well.
Woah that is huge news. How are you handling the news.
I am happy to hear that you will be ok. Enjoy having no kids while you can!
That does not sound fun. What did you do to prepare. 
That is very smart thinking!
How old were you? If you were a kid that deserves a pass!
You live and you learn at least it was a petty crime and nothing serious!
Thats sweet of you the flu is a pretty gnarly sickness to go through. You sound like a good friend!
Thats good at least he is getting better hell survive!
Theres nothing wrong with that
You should celebrate too. I would
That is always disappointing. Did you have a good time with your friends anyway?
Sounds like you guys know how to have fun no matter what. You have good friends. 
I too feel the same. What did happen at last?
Yeah very good to hear! congrats!
Eww I hate neighbors that have no class.
Maybe you should start a petition in the neighborhood to kick her out.
How awful! Please tell me you can laugh a little about it now?
Embarrassing things happen to all of us!
Amazing! I wish I could see a pic of it!
Oh he will be but enjoy it only babies once
thats a pretty long date! Where did you guys go?
That sounds like a fun day! My wife and i used to go to movies a lot!
Thats terrible.  Was he already very sick?
Im sorry he went through that.
Those were the days right. I loved those paychecks no bills.... can we go back to that? 
Yeah and I bet it was like a whole 100 or 200 bucks and we were probably feeling like a ceo. 
How does that make you feel? Is that a dealbreaker
Ah I guess you have to save money somewhere
Oh no I am sorry to hear about that were you together long?
Thats good make yourself available and open for others and you will find the next relationship
That is embarassing but a good story at least!
That is for sure you can always count on parents for that
IT does go fast. I was just changing my daughters diaper and now she is in junior high!
I miss being called mommy. One day youll be called grandma
that is embarassing but were you at least okay?
Well maybe they found that endearing in a way!
How old were you when you did it?
That was nice to repay them back with dinner
im sorry to hear that. i know exactly what you are going through. My brother tragically passed away 2.5 years ago. He was only 32
I know how hard it was for you. My parents and my brother lived in a different country so i couldnt even go there at that time to be with them. I felt heartbroken and alone
To thank whom?
Is that who got you the job?
What job do you have?
Are you in a union?
did you find it ?
well thats good
how old did you turn ?
When will you be able to visit?
Oh boy that must be amazing for him
what did you end up watching instead
Oh yeah thats always nice. Sometimes they just dont get it though.
Wow you sound pretty confident! You must really know what youre talking about.
I am afraid to fly too.
I know right planes make me nervous.
Uh oh. I bet she wasnt happy when she found out.
Yeah I can understand that.... But it probably would have been best to invite her anyway just in case.
that is awesome. sundays are usually my veg out days.
mine is going crazy with mosquitos
i tried to trim my tomato leaves yesterday but i got bit up so bad i ran back inside
What does your husband do for work?
My uncle use to be an iron worker so I know exactly what you are talking about.
That is VERY understandable. Emotional affair is still a betrayal. 
Well its nice he is kind but yes that is a little strange. Women can usually take that as something and try to get with your man. 
What is her best talent?
Does she draw or paint? How any students are in this program?
That is terrible.  I dont know why teenage boys can be so mean.  What did you end up doing?
Thats good that she has a big brother that can defend her against the bigger kids.  It is just terrible that a teenage boy would act that way to a 10 year old.  No excuse for that.  I hope you dont have to deal with it again though.
Im sorry what is his job?
Hopefully they will give him a better shift.
Hey thats awesome!!!  What are you planning to buy with it?
Thats an awesome very adult thing to do!  Congrats!
I dont like them either. It makes me sick.
Oh my gosh! That is disgusting!
What does your husband do for a job?
You already told me that. Is he in sales or something similar?
that is no good! you need someone to be there and take care of you.
I have never been married so i cant imagine  but I would want to be with my spouse every moment of every day.
It is so hard and so rewarding to see them grow up. 
I bet.  I really want to hold on to mine forever but I know that they need to grow up.  I hope you are still able to make memories with yours even as they are getting older.
That is pretty scary. Did you find out where it came from?
Smart move. You dont want to get involved in a gunfight. Glad you made it out safely.
So sorry to hear that.. May i ask how did it happen?
How sad.. Feel better knowing that he is in a better place now buddy
Wow. Congratulations! Is your new job near home?
Oh thats awful. What did you do? I wouldve dumped her and beat that dudes face in.
Well I gave you the solution right there buckaroo. All ya gotta do is execute.
Oh nice. did you have a good time?
Aww that is really sweet to hear
I dont have a normal job anymore but that would frustrate me as well.
What a disgusting person. Im just being honest.
Oh the broadway musical? I heard really good reviews of it
Oh yeah he is such a true genius of our times he deserves it
Oh.. Were you sick?
Dont feel bad about it buddy this happens to all of us sometime. Feel better
Oh dang. How do you think that is going to go down?
Im sure everything will be fine. Just gotta be yourself!
Oh no.. That should have sucked for you. what did you do?
As you should. It will pass away dont worry
Im so sorry but what a joyous occasion. 
So happy for you. Is this your first grandchild?
That sounds like a great place to propose! How did it go?
Thats so heartwarming! I hope your relationship works out very well!
That is nice to have a friendly boss.
I envy you. That is cool.
Yes I did that too
This happened to me also.
Did you try to exercise?
That is so exciting!! buying a house can be such a great experience.
Oh so it is brand new.  I bet you cant wait to move in.
I know how you feel. Im working right now 
Can you blame her?   I mean if i didnt have bills thats what Id be doing.
Isnt that the best!  My 3 year old the same thing!  I couldnt be happier or more proud!
She may be a natural artist!
I see.. did they complete them?
Well we were kids once too.. We can understand their point of view as well. Glad you got to spend quality time with them though
Thats really cool! i hope you get one very soon buddy
Yeah i can understand how that can be frustrating. Dont worry things will fall in its place soon enough
awh memories what were they of? 
so cute i love those memories i bet it was beautiful. 
Why did he leave you?
Thats awful and there has to be another reason for it. I cant stand fathers who behave that way despicable. 
Congratulations on getting an interview.  Good job in prepping for it Im sure youll do well.
Oh! Was the ice cream cake for you?
Awww that is kind of disappointing. Ice cream cake sounds tastier than pineapple cake.
Oh im so sorry to hear that.. how long were you married?
It must have felt unbelievably hurtful for you.. I hope you find someone very soon..
I can understand that. I dont get nearly as many birthday wishes as I used to. I guess it happens as we get older.
I agree. I think they think we dont care about our birthday so they dont care either. But they are wrong.
Oh! I am so happy for you. Congratulations. What was the job?
That sounds very interesting. Im sure you will do great. 
Holy moly! That would have scared me too! Did you kill it?
That is understandable.  Such an experience can be tramatic.  Did you eventually learn?
My wife had a similar experience she still doesnt drive.  Good for you for overcoming it.
That sounds miserable!  Did you do it yourself?
At least you saved money doing it yourself!
Oh wow! that stinks. Im sorry
I bet it was. At least its over now 
I bet.  I was the same way.  How did you guys meet?
Nice.  Thats a relatively unique way to meet.  What store?
I would be furious.  What did you do?
What was the outcome?  Did the professor believe you?
Thats awesome!  What kind of house is it?
Thats gonna be a lot of fun but a lot of work.  Good luck!
that is exciting! what kind of car?
wow that is impressive. ive always liked mustangs. what color?
Ive had pets to do that too.
Well I guess it really loves you.
I bet! Im sorry you are feeling down.
Times like that would be so awesome! I hope they come back for you
A spelling bee  what fun! Im sure you will win  I bet youve worked hard toward your goal.
Thats a lot of studying. Well the best of luck to you though I know you wont need it after all that hard work!
Thats one way to get them. being a big girl is such an accomplishment
Do you guys get to talk a lot?
Getting through it can only make your relationshipi stronger though
Was he sick before?
You must be really excited!
Are you planning something special when she comes home?
I am sorry to hear that they frighten me as well.
Yes those scare me to death when they come out of nowhere.
Great where will you be going?
Well that will be fantastic. Hope you have a good time.
Cool beans. Where was she?
Did you get to visit? Germany is quite beautiful.
Where is it gonna be at?
Is someone important coming voer?
which one was it
it wasnt that scary to me
Aww. Thats nnice
No one writes letters anymore... its kind of sad
That would definitely creep me out.
I have done that before lol
i bet shes a wonderful woman
hold on to her
oh no is it completely destroyed not salvagable ?
so sorry to hear about this disaster
Congratulations!  Dont be too nervous!  You must have done something right to get the job in the first place!
That is natural.  Im sure you will do great!
Well thats good.
Wow i bet you miss her so much. My wife is going overseas with our son and they will be gone for 1 month! I know i will be miserable without them
I will play PubG after work to keep me busy lol
Well it will be over soon
I bet you are. I definitely woudl be
What has you so nervous?
Have you considered taking a weekend trip there to see how you like it?
Did it leave you to do it alone or were there others ?
I see how that would be frustrating.
Ive heard about this movie but ive never had a chance to watch it
Aliens? I didnt think it was about aliens i thought its about ghosts and stuff
Well I wouldnt know lol
I dont have any sharing friends either lol. Youre lucky
What kind of food?
Did you start training him when he was young?
Thats awesome. I love a well trained dog.
I know lots of bad dog parents. Ive got a well trained dog too so I understand.
Oh thats good for your friend but it sounds like you really would like to live there! I can imagine feeling jealous
You will get there! I would just be happy and supportive of your friend and visit often!
Oh no did you find a backup caterer
Of course the wedding can be the most stressful event of your life
i like to call them deadbeats
what do you collect for ? credit cards or utilities ?
Oh I just did that recently. I just got back from 2 months. It will be a fantastic time.
I went to Thailand and Vietnam. Dont worry about anything. Traveling was so easy and people are nice everywhere.
Oh wow I would of been terrified!
Was it a large amount?
Thats rough. Im sorry that must put you in a real bind.
Congradulations on being prepared.
It reallyi s the best way to do things. That way even if you forget something youve got time to remember and remedy the situation
Haha sometimes wifes are nice to have around.
That sounds lovely. Did yall make it a special day to remember?
That sounds fantastic. Im sure you guys will remember that day for a while. What a nice surprise.
why you should feel bad.. i am not getting you my friend
oh.. you must be sweet then.. your wife is lucky
What movie was it ?
The worst a movie has gotten me was Event Horizon.
wow lol I didnt know you can track ovulation. Good luck with getting pregannt
please dont lol im a man I appreciate what you women go through when youre pregnant or on your period but im okay with not knowing details
Its the worse having to wait for something you really want. 
Oh nice. Make a nice lunch to keep yourself busy. The delivery will be there in no time if you keep yourself busy.
Yes I agree. I did have a good relationship with my m other in law but recently it changed.
Mine has been around 7 years and its been a little rocky.
Oh no. Is he responsible with school or a job?
I understand he will learn though once he gets a job and has to pay bills that he will want to go to sleep at a decent time!
Did you have a bunch of people show up there at the party?
Thats a great job! Well done!
Yeah she seems like a great woman youre lucky to have her.
You should take her on a vacation or something. She deserves it.
At least you can handle those. I cant do any of those
Well they would probably be the same if they were in your shoes
Understandable.  What was the reason?
Did you explain it to them.  Thats a pretty good reason to miss it.
Sure that makes sense.
Hows your relationship now ?
Oh cool! What movie are you going to see?
Oh awesome! Its a new one?
thats extremely sweet of you! youre a nice person. my wife and i made some blessing bags and we give them everytime we see homeless people
basically its a bag with necessities. we put some water some non perishable foods snacks some wipes and a little bit of money
What a great idea where did that come from?
Well I need to keep that in mind great suggestion 
Oh wow what a long trip. How long did it take?
That is a long time to be in the car for sure.
Oh well thats a plu!
So where did you stop along the way?
Well at least you have a plan. Are you planning to start the renovation soon?
Awesome. Im sure its going to turn out great.
I can understand that. Did it end up going ok?
Thats good. Im glad everything worked out.
thats good to hear! Good for you! Maybe i should go to the pool too lol 
true! Do you just swim or you do some water aerobics?
Im sorry to hear that. Have you ever been married?
Im so sorry. It wasnt meant to be.
Thats such a good tune.
Yeah its definitely a classic. It reminds me of my childhood as well.
Maybe you just have to find a way to get him motivated without showing anger.
Yeah just stay positive about it Im sure youll figure something out.
Was it just a bad feeling you had?
Maybe someone died there
Oh yeah the buffering?  Very annoying.
I hear that.  Sometimes the classics are impossible to find.
Did you get her something special?
Oh awesome That is great!
You wont know an answer if you dont ask
Just play it safe
That sucks after going all that way too and you didnt even get to try it. Im sorry.
I hope you do get to try it soon. Be sure to let me know how it is!
Wonder if it has to do with his diet?
Will he be back soon?
Okay I see. That must be hard.
I think weve all done a version of that.
ha thats too funny.
That sounds tough   does he get back soon?
What was going on with her?
That sounds pretty serious glad she is okay now!
What sort of issues?
Cats are always getting into things and causing destruction.
Oh no could you ask your supervisor for guidance?
Sounds like you have a good plan. I wish you the best
That was very sweet. What movie did you want to watch?
Oh ok! The gift was a good idea so that you ca watch it as much as you want
So you covered him. It was very noble from your side to act in this way
Well at least you did something good for that coworker and most probably he feels indebted toward you
So you have to wait a week longer to see her again? That stinks.
Yeah I can imagine. At least its only one week!
Great to hear that.I hope you enjoy your new life.
I am sure you will create a beautiful house.
Oh I am so sorry to hear that. Have you had it since it was a kitten?
That is so sad. I had a dog die unexpectedly and it tore me up.
Yeah I understand.  Are there any charities nearby that you could volunteer for?
Well thats good of you.  Do you think homelessness is due to mental incapacities?
Why did he do that?
Oh my did you have a good time?
I dont understand that either. It really makes you sick to think about. Have you experienced this?
No I have not. I would never participate in that either. My wife and I are extremely happy together.
It always seems to work out like that doesnt it?
I may have to check that out as well.
Yes but they also bring about a lot of good changes as well.
Yes the first years of a babys life the mother pretty much spends entirely with them. The husband is kind of left out in the cold.
That is wonderful! Moms are truly a gift! I miss my Mom at times. We are workcamping in the mountains of NM and my Mom lives in TX.
We have always moved frequently with my husbands job but my parents usually end up following us lol. Now that we are fulltime RVers they dont follow. I miss that sometimes. I am glad you have your Mom close! Cherish those times!!
Wow yes I always feel the same way! I would love to pass of grocery shopping to someone else.
I bet. I live about 20 minutes from a real town which is far enough for me.
Omg that sounds like so much fun!!!!! Orlando? 
You are going to love it 
Thats great. Takes a lot of dedication to be that prepared.
You should be not everyone can really be that dedicated about something.
What did they do this time?
Well that is very nice of them to do!
I am sure hes doing it to take care of you guys and I am sure you are pampering him too for doing it. 
Pamper him all the way up until you get some lavish vacation! loooool Im joking partially! Happy for you guys tho! 
What will you try and do?
What is your field of work?
that is really cool i hope you get the job
not yet but i think once i have the skill for it i will defenetly will.
That would bother me as well. Have you discussed this with her?
I can understand that. I actually broke up with a previous girlfriend over the same type of thing.
Oh that must have been so exciting and surprising! 
Did you all do some fun things while he was there?
Well thats a real tragedy.
Can you buy two next time and have one in reserve?
Wow that mustve been hard to uproot your whole life. Are you happy about the move?
Thats awesome! Ive been wanting to do the same actually. I hope you have a fabulous time in your new place and new job!
What was the boy kids problem?
Maybe he has the crush on her?
Im so sorry to hear that. Is there treatment or a cure?
That sounds awful. How is he feeling?
Sounds like a nice surprise! my god how beautiful. 
Thats seriously one of the best presents ever. Im happy for you! 
Your hard work should pay off! Any strategies?
Summer semesters are difficult. I did them too. Best of luck to you!
Brought back a lot of memories I guess ?
Always nice to have memories of the good old days.
Wow what an awesome proposal that mustve been. And maybe a little embarrassing lol.
Haha sounds very sweet though. 
Oh no what are you going to do?
I never listen to those warnings either but now Ill have second thoughts.
Congratulations! What did you name her?
How sweet! Does she know any good tricks?
What?  Thats awful!  How did you find out it was them? Did someone see it?
Oh boy.  I would confront them kindly and tell them youd like to reach a solution without there being a fight or problem.  Those situations are never fun. Sorry.
Thunder always keeps me up it gets so loud sometimes! And the wind!
Yes I could understand how it could be very fearful. Its quite scary to be woken up that way as well.
Im so proud of you! Ill pray for your success! 
Its got to be so exciting though! 
That sounds lovely. Do you have many flowers?
That is quite impressive! You must be very proud of your work!
That was very kind of them. Did they charge you for their labor?
That sounds like a good neighbor. I hope that your home was not damaged.
Congratulations to you both!  Whats he going to study in college?
Thats a great degree for the future and getting a job.  Good luck to him.
Thats so awesome Im really jealous! Ive never been either and Im actually saving up for a trip!
Disney World too Ive always wanted to go! I hope you guys have a wonderful time!
Im sorry I hope you didnt get injured
lol I can imagine
they are such a bad company
oh yea exactly
Its quite disheartening to know people jump queues
I believe he will pay somehow. They call it karma 
That must have been scary.  Its always better to be safe in a situation like that.  
Its great that you had an RV to stock and pack more things.  Glad to hear the storm missed you!
Wow you are lucky to have someone so thoughtful. I bet you were feeling great.
That is awesome. I am sure you will return the favor one day.
Did you plan the anniversary?
Well hopefully they still have a good time.
oh thats great. You must be the luckiest granddad in the whole world
All the best buddy enjoy the celebrations 
Im sorry to hear that its very hard to cope with
It is i feel for you! i had a relative that progressively got worse and its extremely difficult  
Thats awesome! I love when people remember my birthday.
How fun! I wonder how they knew.
Did you study hard?
Then I am sure you will do well.
That is impressive! I hope he is proud too!
oh that is awesome! its so nice to get money in a lumpsum
that makes it very difficult and hard not to get your hopes up
Oh wow! I would be very angry as well! Unless it was some kind of emergency or extenuating circumstance
He didnt even call to let you know whats going on?
That is a great mindset to have and should lead to a great day!
That is a very kind thing to say! i appreciate that
That is sad to hear. Dont worry you will find someone that is for you.
It seems like that but it is not true. You have to be patient and you will find your love one day.
I would have been terrified like need a nice strong drink type of terrified! How did it end up going?
Im glad it all went well! It seems that sometimes when you are extremely nervous it can make time pass quickly too. 
Im sad to hear that. Have you tried using social media to make new friends?
Try going to the park then. You could run into someone that is into you.
That is awesome! Parents are the best
lol i know the feeling! and being a parent i now understnd
awesome! was it hold em?
most def i love playing hold em
I also do not like spiders. I dont even like watching Spiderman due to not liking spiders.
Maybe you can go see a doctor and he can help you with your fear.
The only video game I have ever played is Super Mario.
It is a classic even my kids enjoy playing it.
thats always terrible but congrats on the anniversary!
that makes the situation worse when your expectations are through the roof
I definitely relate to that feeling why cant they take us with them!?
Well I hope she gets home soon to make the home a home again! 
It is pretty crazy how fast grow up when you get older it seems like a couple of weeks and they are in high school
Thats definitely a factor sometimes I forget about some of my nephews even exist.
I am so sorry to hear that. No one should have to go through something like that.
Im sure I would have done the same thing! But stay strong many people have beaten cancer! Keep a positive attitude and stay by her side!
that was an awesome day for me too hard to believe it was nearly  10 years ago
agreed! its a shame growing up how fast you wanted to be an adult
Oh man now that sucks! You gotta be careful on those wet roads. At least youre okay.
Is your car still drivable?
Good thinking.  You can never be too prepared only under prepared.
Yep! or if youre house will be hit.  Many possibilities with tornadoes!
oh my goodness. what a blessing
it much be a huge weight off of your shoulder
that is great to hear! a faithful spouse is a blessing
i am sorry to hear about that! i hope everything gets better for you!
oh no I hope you did any sustain any injury
Yea he will definitely get caught
that makes two of us! i am terrified of all snakes
eww thats disgusting and makes it worse it was a poisonous snake
Ah thats terrible. I would be annoyed as well I think.
Im sorry to here that but life goes on and tomorrow is another day. We just have to make the best with what we are given. Youll get through this.
really why is that?
I think with time you will get used to it.
That is great Why does he travel so much?
What does he do for his job?
Thats good is it very important that this friend be there?
That makes sense! Im sure he will be there for you!
There you go! I need to work on that area of my life as well.
I bet you have more energy and more confidence for sure!
How you been together long?
Awesome. Ive got you beat by 1 year. You know I just read the average couple from the time to meet to the time the ends things is 6 years. If you make it past that it will probably last for every. 
You are pretty lucky!
Maybe I should buy some. I never win either. Its about time
I am sorry maybe she will share?
That is infair
I hate when that happens! Especially when you have been waiting for the beach!
Thats what matters most that you had a good time and made memories!
Congratulations! Im sure you earned it!
Youre welcome. I wish you the best in the new position.
Oh no! That is awful that can mess with your mood.
I can understand that!
I bet that is a rough schedule.
Does he get any nights off?
It sounds like a great chance to start over fresh! Where are you moving to?
Oh wow! How exciting! I cant wait to come visit you there so you can show me the sights!
Ugh why do people do that? Its annoying.
Do you smack the women who do it?
Yeah they are so good! George Lucas is a genius! 
Yeah me too. I prefer the first three. They are very different from the others. 
Youre unable to hold them in?
Im sorry that must be pretty rough on you!
Wow that is awesome
That is a long time
do you pick up after them or tell them anything?
Oh i can relate i am also afraid of that
haha . I remember a time i was in vegas i was scared to go on this really high ride
i hope you get that call soon!
wow thats great congrats!
oh nice how long are you going for ?
that sounds like a great time.
I understand that! what kind of car is it?
Thats pretty fancy! Does it have all the bells and whistles?
That is great! I know my sister has had help with that a lot too! It can get expensive. You know they have new clothes from target at goodwill a lot that helps with spending 
its like 5 for new clothes good quality a lot. Great! Yes it is a lot to buy clothes for ever growing kids
THAT is the spirit of a true giver and the only one I would take a gift from! Great in laws!
That is despicable. Did you report her to the teacher?
She could drop her from the class and give her an F!
Me too! Who did this to you?
I understand that! When I am ready to go I just want to hurry up and go. I hate sitting around waiting too. Maybe you should make her wait and see if she likes it. Lesson 
Thats so sad! Can you email them?
Can you see him before he goes?
Hey thats pretty good. Do you have any goals set for yourself?
Well I hope yours work out as well. Focusing on the goals of others probably gives you a lot of inspiration.
Oh I know! I could kill people like that.
And they dont have a voice of their own.
Congratulations! What made it so great?
Ah well you earned it!
oh.. congrats.. you must be happy then
wow then... do you have any special plans to celebrate ?
Thats very admirable of you.  How do you help her?
We need more people like you in the world.  Theres always someone out there who needs a helping hand and could use a friend.
I totally agree. People are too divided by their political views these days.
Everyone is always fighting over these things its a sad thing to see.
Oh! pity about you. 
Hope you had good time after your work!
 I am so sorry to hear that.
I hope you find a new puppy love soon.
I am glad to hear that!  What is happening with him?
That is awesome!  I hope he got a good raise
I cant imagine why people would do that. Animals are helpless.
Youre very empathetic then! I hate seeing animals suffer as well.
Hiking is probably a tough environment to meet people! LA is real nice but I hear the people there arent
Thats cool! Did you end up keeping up with them after you left?
Thats sweet to have such a memory of her. Did she pass away then? 
Im so sorry pets are like children 
Teething is a hard period for babies and moms
Poor baby. I remember my kids teething too. It was horrible
Ha ha Im sure hell get the the hang of it eventually. It takes some children longer than others to get used to.
Im not looking forward to it when I have a kid! I cant function without a good 8 hours of sleep.
How does that make you feel ?
Ive never left the US. Ive never been north of Kentucky.
Ive spent my life turning my home into where I want to be instead of where I want to leave.
That was nice. What did you have?
That sounds good. I bet it was fun to hangout and eat with your friend.
It is very annoying! I hate it too
Some people should not be allowed to drive! We were rear ended 2 times last months! Can you believe that
Thats ok everyone has some kinda fears that make little sense to others.
Hey I cant sleep without socks. Its no big deal.
That is really nice of you! I am sure they appreciate it
They get to enjoy themselves and have a good time! 
Oh no did you have candles and flashlights available?
Good thing you have to be prepared for those situations
Oh I am so sorry. Cats can be very mischievous sometimes. 
Yea I feel you. At the end of the day you cant blame the cat. It didnt do this on purpose.
Man Im sorry to hear that...Ive wasted a good protein shake doing that once
Oh well I was starving...I just rinsed it out with some mouthwash and ordered a big pizza lol
I use to live in an older house that had a tin roof and Id always love hearing the rain beat on it! Helped me sleep like a baby.
I wonder if thats a common thing? Its very relaxing.
Im sorry for that. Have you tried going to therapy?
Im so sorry but youll get there in time.
Ive never gambled. What happened when you were playing video poker? And is it fun?
Wow check out Mr. Moneybags over here! That must have been a real thrill though.
Yes it does seem like a fun place. I would love to go to the Mardi Gras.
That sounds like a lot of fun! I wish I would have seen it!
Id say thatd be a real disappointment to say the least.
End of friendship.
I am not quite sure what you mean by that?
Thats OK It happens to the best of us!
oh that little unfair
oh enjoy dude
Congrats! How do you feel about it? And what is the presentation on?
Its good that you worked hard on it. I hope you get a raise or a bonus for your labor!
I think so.  Sometimes our friends show us sides of them that they rarely show other people.
Did you make the party anyway?
Wow. That is a blessing
I am going to always take care of my kids like that
I hate doing dishes any way
Cool I just finished today
Yeah we had a hard time today lol
I am going to do like you next year for sure!
That happens sometimes
I probably wouldve cried
Was it like black friday? lol
Stick to your routine next time
I hear ya! I am definitely shopping online
plus you can usually get some kind of cash back. I love deals
Ew I hate spiders. We are in the process of getting them out of our garage.
Oh no throw it away!!!!
How was it too much?
That sounds very strange
How big is the bonus usually?
Wow well I hope you guys get it this year then!
Wow good for you guys!
That is young I wish someone had helped you!
Math has never been my strong suit. Im more of a history type of person.
That was very altruistic of her! 
Why she is doing that?
Ah ok I undestand.
why did you go back?
good for you best of luck!!
Oh no. Did you have a good backup plan ?
Maybe you can transfer after a bit ?
I understand! I would feel the same way.
What do you mean by that? Im not a gamer really
Oh youre right it has. I hear about it more and more
I hate that most parks close during the winter too. Do you have any indoor type amusement parks near you?
I feel you. You will just have to go as often as possible during the other months to make up for the winter time without!
Ooh congratulations! Ill be graduating soon too. Whats your major?
Thats very cool. My dads an electrical engineer actually. Im a cybersecurity major myself.
What is your most prized posession?
Oh wow maybe he can get a scholarship! I know some colleges now offer bowling athletic programs.
You must be very proud of him! Yes I love to bowl with my family but Im not very good at it!
That is scary. Do you have means of defending yourself?
Maybe you can call a neighbor or something to see if they see anything suspicious outside your house! Dont hesitate to call the police if you feel you should!
Ha ha! I have done that too. So embarrassing.
Phew so they got most of the attention.
It can be hard in those situation I know you dont want to loose a friend in the end.
Yes you should but when you feel comfortable dont feel guilty you are the victim he is a sad case you got this.
Aw that has to be tough not to see your friends. Do they visit often?
How awful! Youre much better off staying at home. I hope you find new friends soon!
School can be tough. How many credits are you taking on?
Engineering is already tough. If you can get through this Id say youll be very successful in life.
oh youre gonna be awesome i bet!
yeah that always happens dont be hard on yourself as long you do great
Nice. What was dinner?
I havent met a pizza I didnt like yet.
I remember my kids going through that. Do you have teething rings for him?
Poor boy. I hope he gets through it soon.
What is the game about you must love games it will take up your whole night.
Really that is a cool story to tell when asked how you 2 met did yall play online together a lot?
Oh thats not good. Do they argue about small things?
Yikes that shouldnt be. I think youve really stepped up in this situation. Hopefully they can see that and change their ways.
I love storms too but yeah thats a nuisance.
Yikes! Lightning didnt strike real close by did it?
That is good. Will it be a difficult semester?
That is good. I am sometime a procrastinator.
Awww what fun.  That must have been so nostalgic for you!  I wish I was back in childhood again sometimes.
I saw a toy that they are bringing back from a couple decades ago when I was a kid and wow it was so neat to see!
Wow. Siblings got skills.
How long has he been bowling?
I am sorry to hear that I am sure you will be fine. What kind of job is it?
Well it shouldnt be too bad. If you couldnt do the work Im sure they wouldnt have hired you.
Thats a bummer. At least you will be more attentive next time?
Indeed. If everyone got worked up over things like that wed all be out of jobs.
That sounds incredible. Did you visit the Great Salt Lake?
Man I definitely have to go there. Sounds like a great place for sightseeing.
Oh my god Do you think he got it just because you like it so much?
That is hilarious In a cruel kind of way.
Ohh I feel you. I felt the same way when I was planning to buy a new car.
Yeah. I believe you are emotionally attached to it!
Wow why would they even do that?
Sheesh people will take anything thats not nailed down these days.
Thats terrible to hear. Is it old?
Are you thinking of getting a new car?
Me too. Its nerve wrecking
Maybe you should take some classes to help you with that
Ohh cleaning dog poop is always been annoying yet petting the dog is always amusing.
Ha ha. I feel sorry for you though. No one likes to clean the dog poop!
That has happened to me several times
Lol. They probably just laughed about it over dinner
Were you able to get them?
That was so sweet of him! Youre lucky to have such a sweet boyfriend
Thanks you for your service
I have never had that feeling.
Well thats good. Probaby saved a bunch of coins
I would also cry with you!
I cry at least a day!
oof that sucks really bad
yea i can imagine it is
That sucks are you going to leave Texas or stay?
How much did the damage cost you?
I do not even have a toilet.
I use the woods!
Really? Is that a promotion?
Good for you.
Were you afraid of heights and high speeds?
I am glad you did. Rollercoasters are thrilling and should not be missed out on!
oh wow! that sounds very special!!!
im glad your family did that for you
Oh wow! That must have been terrifying! Were they able to help her?
I could imagine. It must have been amazing to see her rescued though!
That sucks. Did they give you any reason why they wont verify it?
Well I hope they can get you taken care of soon. I know I hate it when I cant get to my money I have online.
I am the same.. woke up at 6 for no reason
LOL i hate that
I understand those kind of situation could scarry.
i hate those as well
I am so sorry to hear that. 
I truly hope you can recover from this major loss in your life.
im glad to hear that! 
good luck to you! i wish you the best
i think you had good skills with tools
thats cool of you 
Oh thats great. What are you going to be doing?
Oh wow that sounds like a tough job but I bet you will be good at it.
Oh Im sorry.  What are you thinking of getting?
Nissans are very nice and rugged.
That is a great move!  I did the same thing.
Good job keep up the good work!
What was for breakfast?
You cant! Sounds like a wonderful morning!
Thats awesome its not easy to do that so kudos to you!
Ill keep my fingers crossed that you won
Oh awesome!  Congrats!!!!  How has it changed life for you?
Thats really fantastic!  Im glad to hear you turned your life around.  
That sounds so great. Who was the one to come up with this plan?
I see. I wish I had a partner and we could go to such places together too. Maybe some day hopefully
Wow! That was really nice of her! What was the occasion? You guys must be very close.
That is so awesome! I am sure you appreciate her for it. Its good that you have a great relationship with her.
Do they live in a different state than you?
Sorry to hear that.  Remember those who mind dont matter and those who matter dont mind
Souds like you were content.
I feel you. Sometimes its nice to veg out and just watch tv.
Oh no! Thats awful!  I watch animals for a few different people and I would never do that.  Thats very unprofessional. Did they have an emergency?
Thats ridiculous.  I was going to see who might have helped you.  Im so glad your friend helped.  Hope you had a great time!
What kind of dogs do you have?
Do you like to watch tv with you doggies?
Do you talk with her on the phone?
Will you throw her a comeback party?
Oh thats cool. Did you find any good memories in there?
Nice! It sounds like a really good bonding experience.
Im so sorry.  I know you mustve felt helpless but coming from a wifes perspective I would know my husband couldnt be right next to me but his words and love make all the difference. 
I totally feel you.  My husband as gone for work so much for a couple years.  It will just be a season of life and then youll be back together!  Communicating even more than ever and encouraging each other can help so much.  Youre doing great!  I hope youre together soon!
So who annoyed you?
So did it result in a brawl?
Im sorry to hear that. I hope hes feeling better now.
Hes lucky to have you there.
I can understand that. Do you try to find ways to fill your time while youre waiting?
Yeah waiting for someone can be a real pain. 
I also love dogs.
Puppys are the best. I love puppies!
how much did you pay for the surgery?
uhmnnn! scared of your cat or the vet?
Holy hell that must have been scary! Did you see it happen?
Im sorry to hear that. I really hope you are able to get over this and feel at ease again!
Im so sorry!  That can be a devastating time. I have been there before.  How long did you have your dog?
I completely understand.  Something that helped me was to have pictures up and also have a little remembrance each year with some other family that loved him as much as I did.  Just take it a day at a time.
Aw Im sorry well Im here to talk to you! 
I feel you.  Ive been in that position and it can get dark.  But theres always people online to talk to!
That car is quite expensive I wish I could afford one too.
Work hard and maybe you could afford it.
Thats sad why dont you go visit them?
Thats a bummer hopefully you can still talk to them over the  phone or online!
that is not good what was wrong with your food?
did you ask for a refund when you realized the problem?
Why didnt you say anything?
Well then I dont blame you. I would have done the same thing
Thats very nice of her family is one of the best things we have in this world.
As you should be some people dont have anyone to lean on in their lives.
that sounds spooky
oh no i hope you stay safe
Nice! Thats a very nice surprise.  What kind of car?
Wow she went all out hope you drive safely and have fun with it!
I am really sorry to hear that.  Why are you ashamed?
That is really too bad.  Did you all have a fight?
Thats not nice of them are they meaning to be rude?
You should let them know you arent ok with them doing that.  If they are real friends they will stop.
How come? what happened?
Ohhhh.  Yea I would be scared too then.  That sounds terrifying.
Thats good where are they?
Wow did they go there on vacation?
Why would she leave you?
oh no im so sorry to hear that. I know your heart is broken. Did you try to talk to her about it?
What movie did you want to see?
Why wont you be able to watch it?
Oh yeah that sounds very relaxing! I hope it was good weather for you all! 
Thats great! Im glad you had a good time its always nice to have a refresher to get away from everything for a little bit!
Oh boy! Where are you headed?
Congratulations! I hope everything goes well! 
Oh wow. Its like that sometimes. You have to give into your sweet tooth.
Ugh I hate the regret that comes with giving into food cravings. Dont be too hard on yourself. It was just one time.
how awesome. my husband is 7 years cancer free
its amazing news. congrats to you both. enjoy your time together
Six months!  I would be so mad!  What are you going to do about it?
Good call!  I would have done the same thing!
i think you will nail it are you prepared
good then you will do well!
i bet have you told them how u feel about it?
i guess just walk away is all
Well you can get better
You will do better next time I promise
I do not have those
I do not attend school
I am sorry to hear that I hope you had some time together before hand
That is good at least you had some closure at the worst
What did you win?
Oh that sucks.  Those are the types of situations where you cant help it but you know you did wrong the second after its over.
Well there arent any rules against apologizing to your kids?
Yeah you can judge someone like that
Thats a nice gesture from you
Oh man the beach always sounds nice
That sounds like it was lovely
I am sure not many people noticed
I can imagine sorry
I am so sorry I have been there so many times
I am sorry you had to go through that
What did they do
Oh well he will learn
You do what you want you earn it!
Why is he not helping?
Oh well work can be tough too sometimes
I bet you are proud
I am sure she did
that is sweet who from?
Wow how sweet of him you are both lucky!
Oh that is awesome I love those trips down the old memory lane
Oh wow talk about bad timing
Oh no I hate flies
Im ready for a new start for my family and a better paying job!
Yes! and new opportunties for my family. We need the fresh start on life. I dont like living in Texas.
Wow I dont know how you runners do it. I cant stand running. How many miles do you run per day on average?
I usually jog in the backyard but not really running. Im too fat to run.
Its always nice to get some sleep
Oh wow that was nice of him
I am glad for you. I hope it continues
Oh nice its good to have options
Wow they do grow up fast appreciate the time you get!
Oh no that sounds scary
I hope they are
That is not something to take for granted enjoy yourself!
I hope so too best of luck with that!
You can always start tomorrow
It can be hard but you can do it
I get that best of luck friend!
Theyll always have good memories of the beach.
What kind of dog
She does sound adorable
How long did you live in your old one?
Itll take some getting used to.
Sounds like you practice a lot to get good.
Are you the captain?
Is this a common occurrence?
Thats good. I hope its controllable.
He sounds like a great guy. Im glad you have fond memories of him.
She may be skinny but it doesnt mean shes healthy.
Yea I totally understand that. She won the genetic lottery there.
Have you tried speaking with the post office?
Thats ridiculous they should have to do something.
That sounds like fun. what did it bring to you?
Eww... thats pretty gross. I had a cat once that would bring me dead birds too. I think that means they like you!
Watch out! Next thing you turn around and hes driving.
I hope you got some photos.
That is bad. You should have got refunded.
Howd that go?
Oh god roaches. Did you guys use the bathroom anyway?
oh my gosh a plate! That kinda sounds serious.
that is a lot.. most i ever took at one time was 5 classes and i cried at least twice that semester.
Damn that is impressive congrats.. I took 1 class last semester and got an A lol
Thats true. Did you finish the job?
Thats really great. Its nice when everything works out in the end.
Oh all the time. Ive got to change my Depens three times a day.
Oh wow. I just wouldve blamed it on whoever I was with.
Oh I dont know why concerts make me feel a bit sentimental
That must have been horrible! Im so sorry you went thru that
Yes some people call it fate.
That sounds so romantic!
Oh no was it benign?
That is so terrible Im so sorry.
Do you dress up when the new movies come out also?
Ah I bet seeing all of the kids now dressed up does take you back to an earlier time.  Nostalgia has a way of getting to each of us.
what is a dive bar
oh ok. We call them hole in the walls lol
are you going to pass it down too?
well thats nice
Oh yeah that can be a mine field to walk across. Didnt have any issues?
Thats very faithful of you and the right thing to do Id say. 
Did a specific experience cause this? or just instinct.
Thats interesting my mother has always been afraid of heights Not myself though.
I use to go to raves when I was in high school.
Did you get arrested?
Why did she break up with you?
Are you still friends with her?
Me too! the first one I ever went to traumatized me.
That seems like a weird birthday activity.
Have you ever woke her up and told her to stop?
Thats hilarious my mother snores like a monster
Yes! thats actually amazing you have a good friend!
You are lucky! who won?
Yay! is it a family member having a baby
What?!?! thats amazing! starting a family I imagine can be surreal 
Oh yeah? Where are you going?
That sounds like a lot of fun
did you do anything special during your alone time?
that is not good you should try to find an activity for when you are alone
tHat is insane I usually give myself like 2 or 3 days.
Thats right! thats such a good feeling just breezing through a test.
Where did she go?
Oh I bet that was frustrating. Did you get evey thing squared away and taken care of?
Where are you living at?
That sounds amazing
Thats great to hear. What made you think it went well?
Those are good signs! Sounds like you hit it out of the park!
Pools always a difficult game to pick up. Im guessing your first time went well?
Wow. Talking about cleaning up.
Are you still going to attend it?
Of course but at least you can still afford it.
Yes I agree are you hoping for something in particular.
Thats a good hope. Good luck with that. 
That is great I bet she is very proud of herself.
As you should be so many young people give up before reaching their goals.
Me time is very crucial for anyone it help one clear hi or her mind. We are so much alike..
Sort of reduces stressvery crucial
Oh no! Hopefully he is ok. Did you take him to the vet?
What a silly dog than! She will learn to not do that again!
Thats great! Congratulations! Is this your first child?
Congratulations again. Parenthood is truly a great and wonderful experience.
Thats so cool of them. Thats how parents should be
We all need a little help sometimes
Great where did you go?
Was it a good trip overall?
Yes flying is very hard to do. 
Yeah and so little you can actually care on instead of checking.
Why dont you trust?
He is correct. But you should trust some people whom you think theyre good.
Wow that sounds pretty high to me. What was wrong with it?
Wow what a crook that other guy was!
Congratulations! Is this your first child?
Im so happy for you. Have you two thought of a name yet?
Was it any fun?
Yes I wish flying was a bit faster.
Oh no what did she do
Oof that can get messy.
Congratulations! When is it due?
Are you excited? Do you have a name in mind?
Amazing! did you go down rapids and do scary stuff?
Emerged from a bathroom? Intiguing. What do you mean?
OH  Im sorry to hear that but it sounds like he had a bit of character about him
It must be true love!
I feel like that sometimes  but people have usually seen worse.
Oh no! I bet you were terrified! 
Were you guys angry or frustrated with each other?
Must be such an exciting time for your family! 
Be sure to get plenty of rest thought! Its easy to lose sleep in such a time.
Oh I am so sorry. Were you also close to them?
What a sad way to go. If only he could have gotten help.
Wow  hidden depths. Are you going?
Amazing. Just shows that you cant judge a book by its cover
Oh my did it happen to you recently?
That sounds terrifying! Must have been like a nightmare for you.
When did you move in?
Wow thats a tough schedule. Especially with a new baby.
Why were they doing that?
Oh thats awesome! What was the teen asked to speak about? Are they nervous?
When I was growing up I know that my youth leader made a huge impact on me so its really a great thing that you do working with kids. 
try not to get so tense that can harm your health
Take a deep breath and calm the discomfort ... that helps
Cool. Pizza is my fav food. What movie you guys going to see?
I love that movie also. Have fun 
wow i am so proud of that
was it expensive ? any student loans ?
Did they give you any reason for not giving you the job?
Well at least a candidate that deserved the job got it. 
I bet. Im not a very confrontational person so I do everything I can to avoid places like that
You should bring it up to your boss at work for a security guard to accompany you next time!
Did you offer to replace the broken baking dish that you accidently broke?
That sounds like a good friend forgive and forget. She new you did not intend on breaking the baking dish.
That sounds good. Are you moving soon?
I hope you find something that you like and are happy with. Its really important to be happy with where you live.
That is always a good feeling. Such a relief.
It was nice of you to step up and help out.
Haha I can relate to that. I did that too and my friends took a wonderful photo of it. They like to stick it on our yearly Christmas cards to each other
You have to  Everyone has bad moments and if you cant laugh at them then they just eat you up!
How exciting! That is a great accomplishment.
I know how you feel. My oldest is in her sophomore year of college. 
did you talk to them politely or yell back ?
what industry are you in i find that a lot in retail and service
Why what is it that you want them to notice about you that they bypass. 
I completely understand think of it as maybe they are not meant to be apart of your life you will find some good friends just be patient. 
What is exciting to you about swimming?
So you prefer a pool to an ocean?
That is so sweet I love a caring husband has she gotten better?
As you should a good husband is what keeps us women strong also good for you she is lucky to have you. 
I feel you! What do they do for you?
Its rare to have that! I have it now too. It is great to know you have someone to rely on and trust!
Yikes! Was anything damaged? 
Thats pretty scary. Im glad there wasnt any damage and that youre okay.
Wow congratulations! That must have taken a lot of training and practice.
What kind of dog is she and how long have you been competing like this?
Did you stay with other relatives?
Do you Enjoy that?
I bet thats kind of a pain. How are you dealing with it?
I bet. Its so annoying when people show off like that.
ewww did you get a refund or at least a voucher ?
I would have blasted them on Yelp
What about the them park made you anxious?
They can be really scary for people who do not like them.
Why did your friend do that to you?
I am not sure I would be able to forgive someone of something like that it is really rude behavior.
Im sorry to hear that. Have you tried joining clubs or hanging out with people from work?
I know how that is. 
I understand how youd feel that way. Do you trust her around other guys?
Ah. That can be tough in a relationship.
I understand. Horror movies freak me out too. Did you watch the whole thing?
I bet. I dont think I could sit through a whole one.
How long ago did that happen?
I am so sorry to hear if you need to talk to someone about it I am here for you
she must not have loved you
people change over time is she thinking of coming back ?
Was the weather good?
That is awesome I am sure you can not wait to go back
Perhaps try telling the person how it makes you feel
Have confidence in yourself and be stern about it.
That sounds nice. How often does this usually happen?
I hope this continues for you for a long time.
Did you guys get to eat the cake?
its just the way the world is now social media has ruined humanity
it cant get any better than it already is now. 
Have you told them how you feel?
Just sit them down and talk about the way they are treating you
That must have been so annoying. Hopefully you can just get a replacement.
I hope he doesnt do it again.
that is so annoying some people just dont have morals
can you afford to move ?
How does it get you into trouble?
Im sorry to hear that. I guess at least if helps you know you can trust in the future and who you cant.
so proud of yourself right ?
you will be making more money
I hate going to the dentist too. You just gotta go through with it.
By now wish it was less painful hu?
thats cool. I wish I had my dream job
My dream job is being born rich. Its too late for that
Whoa that is always exciting. Baseball can be boring at times.
I love sports. I am glad you got to experience that.
Woot! Thats great! Which brand are you thinking?
Toyota is a great choice
EW OMG Did you kill it?
EEK! Sounds frightening!
That was nice! What does Scottish cheese taste like?
Cheddar is one of my favorites. I live pretty close to Cabot Creamery and I love their sharp cheddar.
Its located in a small farming town in Vermont. I went on a tour of their factory once and it was interesting to see the cheese being made.
You should definitely check to see or stop by Cabot if you ever visit Vermont.
Im sorry to hear that thats very sad. Were you two close?
Thats a bummer Im sure he is looking out for you up above!
Ah man thats a buzz kill are you still going to rough it out in the rain?
Ah dang well theres always next weekend!
Did you have a good time visiting with them?
What did you guys do?
That sounds fun.  Was the weather nice?
What sort of food did you eat?
It is but I think it was all along and people are just standing up for what they believe in more now.
Maybe but I think the best we can hope for is tolerance.
Im very sorry to hear that.  Losing anyone close to you especially a parent would be very hard.  Are you close to other members of your family and were you able to help each other through it?
I bet it has.  Keep sticking by with your family.  Im sure you are all there for each other more than you know.
What did you do to feel that way?
Im sorry to hear that you could make it up to them by going to visit?
Cool! Who are you going to see?
Of course! Grace is so talented! She was on Americas Got Talent right? I get all those reality talent shows confused.
Wow that sounds amazing!
Great news then!
How was that? Were you excited for some more quiet and for them to get back on a schedule? Or are you sad that it shows that theyre getting older?
Ah thats interesting you say that. I thought youd just be like everyone else who say Happy to nudge them out the door! You sound like a good parent
What beach were you heading too?
Who all went with you? That sound so fun.
Thats awesome have you ever tried surfing?
Did you win? LOL
Winning those huge jackpots is always a curse.  Go for a smaller win 
That is so exciting. A little extra cash can always help.
Yes that would be a great surprise. It can also take a lot of stress off of you.
how was it
You should make a wheel you can spin to decide.  I did that once.
Yes you put all the places on it and spin..
Put that on there too!
Oh me too! Do you have a monday to Friday type job?
Oh that is a pretty good schedule. I am a teacher so Im off right now. Its wonderful. 
Maybe its time for a new friend.
ask him to stop being a jerk?
Oh dear that must be difficult. Are there medications to take that will help?
Oh Im really sorry. That is for sure a challenge. 
Im glad you were safe. Tornados are not a fun thing to experience.
Have you only had to deal with one?
Well thats very nice. Im sure you were looking forward to that shopping trip.
Thats was so thoughtful and sweet! Seems like you are a lucky wife!
That is a lot of fun.  What is your favorite holiday to drive around in?
Im sorry it makes you miss your moms decor.  At least you have those memories to hang onto.
That must be comforting!  It is good to have people in your life that are supportive.
Dont ever take her for granted!  Make sure she knows you are thankful!
Oh Im sorry to hear that. Do you not live close to a beach?
That must suck not living close to a beach. Hopefully you get to go back real soon.
Hah seems we both had some luck. Good for him!
You guys should go out and celebrate! 
Lucky! I would not trust anyone in my house!
Oh no! Thats my greatest fear that people will tell my secrets
Aw perhaps she just slipped up? It does happen even to the best of us
Oh that can be scary. I dont watch horror movies because I know that Ill do just that!
Well Im glad you were ok! Sometimes its not just a shadow
Thats the best kind of day.
Must have been so nice what movie did you watch?
I am so sorry to hear about Riley I know he was an important part of the family. How is everyone holding up after the news?
Yes that is true. You know there is peace in another place. He will always be remembered.
I can empathize with you there.  Do you think there might be another way to let her know? 
Well money is not everything one day it will come out and then the timing will likely be worse.
Really!  Good for you!  Are you excited to start or nervous?
Its OK to be nervous but dont let it stop you!  No risk no reward!
That sucks I work with people like that and its just more work for other people
Thats horrible you should tell the boss and get her fired
I bet it was.  Death is never an easy thing to deal with especially for a child.
I hope she will be alright!  I remember how devastated I was when my last dog passed away and I was an adult.  A kids emotions seem to amplify everything! 
You are lucky!
how much did you win?
I have never won that much. Congratulations
Oh geez thats terrible!  Did they run from the scene?  Hopefully they left some information.  I was in a hit and run about 4 months after I bought my new car and I felt sick that it was already hit.
Wow. Do think he had bad intentions?
Oh man...I hate checking the mail..it could be something crappy
Oh god Do you live in the country?
Then the person might be caught do you have a camera? That is really crappy of someone! I have seen people put metal or wood pallets next to their mailboxes because of people doing stuff like this
Its a good idea to have one just in case. Murders robberies etc happen even in smallnice towns. Just for your safety 
That sounds nice.  Did you have a good time?
That is a shame.  At least she made a stopover!
Whats the exam on?
I wish you good luck!
Thats really cool! Was it your first game ever?
Well I think it really cool that you were able to get back into something that you used to do when you were younger!
Thats so interesting because I saw someone post the same thing on a neighborhood app just today.  Is that you? ha ha.
Ha ha guess you werent the one.  That wouldve been crazy!  I hope its okay!  Im sure someone will try to grab it.
oh my goodness thats terrible i am so sorry!
i can imagine! my dad is my best friend i would be devasted
Hey I like alone time!  Just gotta find some cool stuff to do!
oh no!!  The ghosts are coming!! Yeah turn the TV up LOUD D
Holy cow thats awesome!!!  What are you going to do with all that extra moneys??
Thats pretty cool!  Congrats!!
I am so amazed by her! 
theres always tomorrow!
Thats really creepy.
Also some kind of sound alert. You think you could scream for help during those times but a lot of people actually dont.
is that a good show? i have never heard of it
nice! what channel?
That does sound like a great night! I think Im overdue for one of those myself!
Thats great. Its nice when we get some peaceful time for ourselves.
That is a big change!  Are you moving due to a job or something like that?
Yes that is definitely a big change.  I hope you settle in quickly though  change like that can be a drastic lifestyle upheaval but it could also be the best thing ever!
Nice. Do you like your new neighborhood?
That is great. Why did you move?
Im not a fan of doctors most of the time  how did it go?
I cannot stand that  they should not schedule people so close together if they cant handle that pace.
Aww  did you feed the cat?
Thats how we have our cat also  how funny!  They are just irrestible at some point arent they?
Ugh!  Im assuming that it woke you up?
Oh my goodness!!  How irritating!  I hope they didnt call back?
No way! Congrats! Im having twins sometime this coming week
Thats nice! Kids are great
Ive always loved Halloween! Some people get crazy creative!
Thats awesome! Now that I have kids I have even more of an excuse to go out and check out what creative ideas people have every year.
Oh no!  I cant even imagine that  was everyone ok?
Im so glad that everyone was ok.  But I know that was devastating  did you rebuild?
scary! how long were you lost for?
oh good... I was imagining days
Do you think she will be a good teacher for your daughter?
A good teacher makes a huge difference in how well the child learns and how much influence the parents are allowed to have  I hope your daughter has a great year.
I just cannot watch horror movies!!  Did you like it?
Oh I am right there with you!  The last scary movie I watched made it where I couldnt sleep that night.
Oh yeah?  Do you still look awesome like you did back then?
Yeah I bet.  Do you still keep in touch with any of them?
Yeah.  Maybe you should hit them up on FB for a reunion?
I bet you all would live it up and have a blast!
What did he want?  Its kinda scary when that happens you never know what they want.
Well a good samaritan after all!  Im sure you were embarrassed but also glad that you didnt lose your purse!
Nice! What kind of car is it?
Well deserved! I hope she enjoys it to the fullest!
Hey thats awesome!  Where ya goin?
Holy cow thats awesome!  Thats gonna be a fun 10 days!
Cool!  Have fun and be safe!!
Thats a nice getaway
yikes that is pretty horrible
just seems so inappropriate and disgusting
Oh wow I hope you cherished your time with him.
Sorry that that happened to you I hope youre doing well.
What did you do with the money
That is smart. How often do you play the lottery
That is great. Where is the award displayed?
Cool. Will you leave it there forever?
Did you get mad at her?
Hopefully she wont do it again.
That was very nice of you.
That is showing the Christmas spirit.
He probably forgot about it already.
You must of been hard working.
That is great news. Congrats.
Oh no!  I bet that was embarassing 
Im glad youre okay.  Did you have the baby yet??
Do you not have friends?
True but better than nothing.
oh man well at least its a good thing to see them grow
thats fair enough
Wow thats impressive!
Thats what I thought when I did it but I got a 34.
Where did he take you to?
I love Tunica. Did you win at blackjack?
Oh no. hy did you do it?
Did she find out?
Why wasnt it good? Florida sounds like an ideal destination.
I know what you mean but hey like you said it was free.
Awesome are you a millionaire now?
At least you won something though. Ive never won anything from the lottery.
I know how that feels. Maybe try reaching out.
SOmetimes you have to be the bigger person
Dang thats really annoying.  Is your insurance going to cover it?
Yeah dealing with an accident is one of the most aggravating things.
trust your god feeling everything will be alright
Did you buy all the essential items the dog will need? 
Nice! Are you married?
I am forever alone. However I hope you continue to have great relationships and a great life!
Wow! What was it?
Id like to see this vase. Do you like flowers?
what did you do ?
oh no.. what happeneed
ah i hope it all turns out well for you all
I have thats a very cool show
They are very talented on there
yea i remember it seeing go away a few months back sad.
yea those were the gold ole days
Oh no I am sure you can make it up to her
Well you have busy it happens
Love is a great thing I am happy for you
Yeah people can be unpredictable sometimes
you need to take them away!
yea i just take them away and let them cry it out.
That is great!  Do you have anything fun planned for him
That sounds like a good birthday.  I hope you guys have fun
Ah same here. If only we had more holidays in a year!
I guess well never though unless something monumental happens and we get another holiday.
O? Same here. I love storms.
Be careful and dont go outside then.
Nice! What game?
Oh cool Ive heard of it but never played Im not too good with games.
I am happy for you. What kind of work
That sounds like a nice job
I feel you! Do you have everything facing the right way?
Oh well it happens though dont be too hard on people!
Thats terrible. Do you know how long its been going on?
Im so sorry to hear that. What did he say?
Good for her! She must be quite proud of herself.
Oh gosh. Diapers are really expensive. I forget all about that.
Oh theyre all amazing in their own ways!
What breed is she?
Nice. How much do you expect to make?
Thats a pretty good sum of money. I hope you start there as well!
Were all human so having a feeling like that is understandable.
Yea Im always surprised at how much I sweat the little things.
thats a good movie cant wait for the live action version coming out
Is it far away
Well you can still hang out since its not far
Are you glad its over?
I am sorry any backup options?
That is very true sadly
i know what you mean. my family is 800 miles away
i feel for you. it really makes life tough when you cant just take a drive down the road and see them.
Thats horrible. Did he get to go to the dentist yet?
Thats very kind of you to be there for him like that. 
Oh no thats awful. I am sorry for your loss!
Yes we can never be truly ready to lose our babies like that. I have been through it several times. At least they are happy and pain free now.
me too. it worries me that all the food will spoil and my animals will get overheated
does your power go out alot where you live? it only happens a few times a year here thankfully
Wow. Do you remember losing it?
Thats weird lol
I am so afraid of spiders
I have no idea what a wolf spider is. It sounds terrible though
Do you think youll do well?
What class is it?
I relate what is the speech on?
did yo make some good money?
I cold use some money like that
thats awesome to hear a lot of people cheat on each other frequently and dont care anymore
i believe so too  if people are gonna cheat why get married at all
Thats awful but better safe than sorry. How were things when you came back?
Thats a silver lining in all of it at least! 
Thats terrible. I thought they had to offer some sort of alternative. What airline was it?
Ive never trusted British Airways. 
You are so lucky to be talented enough to achieve such an honor. Was it as wonderful as you had imagined it would be?
Sounds like it was a once in a lifetime experience.
I have 3 I bet you cant wait to take him fishing.
Was it at college?
OH wow! Did you get it all over youself?
That sounds like a really stressful situation. Its really good to know that there are still helpful people out there!
Im glad youve put a positive spin on it  
Who do you support? 
Cool. Do you play football too?
Oh yikes! Thats a bummer. Im sure the employees see that kind of thing all the time though.
Oh thats super excited! Im sure youre really proud of him.
Thats super great to hear! Well deserved.
What a nice guy.  There are fewer and fewer of those every day.
Are you goings going to stay friends?
I hope you get better soon!
Thats never fun!  Large unexpected expenses are the worst
Oh no! At least you have something to look forward to the new house!
Oh no! What a terrible thing to have happen! Were you able to confront them?
That is just awful. Now youll have to pay to have it repaired. 
Nice. Did you like it?
It was whowho were them?
Wow! thats great! I bet you feel proud of it!
I bet you were full of joy and laughter yesterday! 
Oh no! Were you gone for long?
What a bad doggie... hopefully they dont do it again
I can hear the sigh of relief in your voice. I bet your anxious about what the next chapter will be. 
I can tell your proud of yourself. Im happy for you!
You will be fine! Stay optimistic about it
I agree but having great joy in life helps
Its good youre motivated! Thats a step in the right direction
I agree. I wish I could go back to school and pay more attention
Thats amazing and a very quick profit!  Im a little bit jealous myself.  
Its amazing the effect something so seemingly small like the company headquarters opening can effect an entire town like that
Yikes.  Did you get injured?
Yeah and the lanes are really slick.  Thats pretty funny and maybe a little embarassing too.
I would be too! Thats a really nice car for his first car!
I do too. Maybe he will left you drive it!
Wow you must be so happy! Nothing like a new car
HAving a reliable car really changes things for the best
Nice! What genre of playlist was it? 
Cool! I like to rediscover old playlists I made when I was younger.
I can only imagine! How is he now?
Doctors are good at what they do! I hope for a speedy diagnosis and recovery!
That is great news!  I bet you are glad to get a fresh start somewhere new.
It is always exciting to move into a new place and make it your own
oh  how he reacted next
its ok it happens with every one
Yes that will be awesome! How long has it been since youve seen everyone?
Thats fantastic that you get to see everyone again! I hope you have a great time catching up.
That is a great accomplishment. I admire your dedication in obtaining that goal.
Its really hard to stick with something like that. I wish I could do it.
That great to hear! Have you started a work out program before?
You can do it! Dont forget to reward yourself for all of your hard work!
Sounds impressive does he mainly play for fun or is he in competitions?
Very nice I would be proud too.
oh no what happened?
that would really help if it was a permanent solution
yeah enough is enough. i totally cant say i blame you.
bwahaha not to mention it will help you get some relaxing sleep.
I hate creepy stuff like that because I get paranoid.
That sounds more odd than what I am used too. Hopefully nothing paranormal is going on.
That will be an amazing trip!!
That will be so great for them  I can just imagine meeting my granson for the first time  what a sweet time you are about to have.
Christmas was always a nightmare for me.
I cried every year knowing santa wasnt coming to my house.
That is great! Its so awesome to feel confident after an interview!
Yes it sure is. Did you end up getting the job?
Was it a ghost?
Ohthat was so hillarious
Thats great keep it up if you can!
Its good that youre being more proactive about your health now.
Man i wish i could get one.
I also drive a chevy and have had it forever as well.
Have you ever sold on Craigslist before? I always have the people meet me in the Walmart parking lot during the day. I have sold hundreds of things and have never had an issue like that. 
It will be okay. You could also have the people meet you at the local police station. The police do not mind and would rather you feel safe.
Is it loud where you are now?  New places are always so fun!
OH that will be such a huge relief Im sure!  Its crazy that people behave that way knowing they are causing other people such strife.
Oh no! How did that happen and how much damage did they do?
That is horrible! What will you do?
That is truly all you can ask for.
I try to never take anything in life for granted. 
Wow impressive. You must have natural talent. Do you plan to make more? 
You can always sell them as well. I live in Amish country in PA and the Amish sell blankets for hundreds of dollars each.
I bet! Is it hard to have a long distance relationship?
I can only image how hard that was before the days of smartphones! Im glad you were able to visit him!
Aww. Its the things money cant buy that bring us the greatest joy no?
That is so true and its a good perspective to have.
Dogs really are such great companions what breed is she?
Yes I have a miniature pinscher he just turned 15.
how come? it will probably be an exciting adventure for you to start
the summer is horrid. heat sweat mosquitos rain and crowds everywhere
I do the same! I think everyone does.
I think its a normal human activity. You dont need to feel bad
Thats the way to do it!  Be prepared to kick its butt and get good grades!
Always put your school first you will be thankful you did later!
Whoa thats exciting!  What kind of car we looking at?
Thats a really goodsafe first car.
Thats awesome!  What kind of car do you want
Well I really hope you are able to save up and get it soon!
Thats annoying I hate how little attention most other drivers pay on the road.
Im glad that you are okay! Keep your eyes peeled for terrible drivers.
I can imagine. How old will they be?
Yeah but also just think of all the amazing movies she has done. 
Now that you what? Tell me!
Oh that is great! Ive heard that exercise can really help mentally and physically!
Thats great! Did you get anything you are especially excited about? Its a restaurant and a store?
Dragon tongue beans! Ive never heard of them! What do they look like?
I will have to look for those. We have a huge variety of foods where I live but this is new to me. 
It sounds amazing! Are the prices good?
How did he scare you?
I bet that gave you a good scare! Gotta love dads and step dads!
Oh that sounds disgusting! 
I hope he gets that taken care of!
I think we never really know what is going on inside peoples mind. Celebrities like Anthony and Robin Williams seems to live a good life but in reality they are suffering.
I completely agree! I think it would even help lower crime rates.
All around it would be a good decision for society. Just last night I was watching Live PD and there was a young man stealing a candy bar. He was a drug addict. I believe if he had the help he needed he would not have to steal tiny amounts of food.
Oh no. Im so sorry. Can you video chat with her?
How wonderful. Thats whats important and makes life meaningful in my opinion.
Wow! That is insane too bad you didnt bet with those kind of odds.
That sounds like a great time one of those nights you always remember!
Yeah the older they get the more teachers they usually get. I think its good because they get a variety.
Yeah schools definitely start things younger now. Kindergarten used to be voluntary back in the day!
I can understand that as I live in Florida and we prepare for hurricanes each year with a plan and emergency rations and supplies.
Yes you are correct. You can always hope for the best but also plan for the worst. Being prepared is a comfortable feeling.
Thats wonderful they say children have a certain gift for picking up languages.
Wow! Thats impressive and a lasting skill for your child to develop.
Did you think about moving after that?
haha are you serious? Did you move in with your girlfriend?
Oh wow! I hope that it was ok!
Oh no. That sounds really stressful!
That is very unusual. She should be proud of herself.
Wow I wish more would follow her example. Thats a recovery.
I havent watched actual TV in sooo long. What do you watch on Hulu?
Thats real neat I might check it out. Ive only ever used Netflix but Netflix is pretty good too.
Aw I bet he feels horrible about it.  Poor kitty!
Aw thats always sad I lost a cat once and I assume thats what happened to her 
That would be horrific.  Do you know someone that this happened to?
That is just horrible.  I think they would have to medicate me for the rest of my life if that happendd.
That is nice of your friend. I hope you enjoyed it.
You can return the favor one day. That is what friends are for!
Do you have any idea where you will go? Is it accompanied?
Well I hope they get there soon so you dont have to wait longer.
Im with you on this one.  What is up with people these days I just dont understand how they could do that.
I think there should be stiffer penalties for people that do things like that for instance more jail time.
i had a similar experience i miss it too
i totally agree
I know that when just the 4 people in my family do go out it runs us about 65.  So we do it very rarely it wastes a lot of money.
A week!?  That is just crazy and pretty irresponsible unless you are a millionaire.
I spent some time there when I was learning how to be an Army Medic. I really enjoyed my time there!
Its better to be safe than sorry. You cant overprepare.
I am glad you didnt get hit. I know how stressful hurricanes can be.
I bet! I hope you were able to catch up!
Thats strange I hope she makes it out ok this time though.
Oh wow I would never consider something like that hurting a dog.
Im sorry to hear that. I hope she passed peacefully.
I am sure she appreciated your visit before her passing. She must have felt loved.
That was a really smart call on your part! Were you worried?
Well it was a very smart thing you did packing those extra supplies.
That sounds pretty stressful. Are you moving soon?
That makes sense. I hate leaving things for the last second as well. Hopefully you wont have to leave everything boxed up for too long.
That is great! You are lucky!
It is a wonderful thing that you have someone to share your life with.
Nice! Which ones did you hear!
That one is a zinger! I remember listening to that when I took my grandma to prom!
Im sure you did fine. what was the subject?
That is great! Can you call him and see if we could all celebrate together?
Well yeah that sounds about right. He has to go to the Championship first and win then party time !!!!!
It is really could to see friends live out their dreams! I will be cheering for him and the team!
Thats sound like a lot of fun! Do you know where I can go get lessons?
I am in VA. I have been looking into it for quite awhile but I think Id be too chicken to jump out of the plane.
Nothing wrong with that. Im definitely with you on the organizational front. I bet theyre not laughing when you get them out of a jam!
It drives me nuts when people are disorganized. My husband is hopeless  I could throttle him sometimes!
Oh man that is really annoying!  Have you found another one you like yet?
Oh man I would be so upset.  I totally understand!  I hope you will be able to enjoy your new place
Oh no! Do you know why?
Aw Im sorry. I hope you get another horse that can at least help to replace that hole!
Do you know he is coming or is it just blind luck?
That is very considerate of you I bet he really appreciates that.
Wow. That is quite an accomplishment! Congratulations!
What was is your doctorate in?
what has she been doing? undercover CIA agent?
Ha yeah gotta make sure the house is back up to wife code before she gets home... other wise theres going to be a price to pay.
It always is plus it gives you some brownie points as well.
I am sorry to hear that my wife has done the same thing. She wore a hat for almost a month when she left the house.
Well like I told her it will grow out it will just take time.
That doesnt sound good. What happened that was so bad?
That sounds like an awful experience. I probably wouldnt go back there anytime soon.
Oh lord. Did you try to set it back up or did you try to sneak away?
Oh no thats really embarrassing! Hopefully they let you off easy since it was just an accident.
I know youre happy 😊
I feel ya lonely indeed.
That sucks. Why did you move from california?
Thats really common actually. Theres a big exodus from there.  They voted for high taxes and now people are abandoning the state beacuse the cost of living is too high.
The weather is nice in parts of california Ive been there.
My sister got married at Laguna niguel
That is a long trip.  Did you do it all in one go or did you take breaks?
Thats not bad I was thinking you were doing it in like a couple days.
Oh poor lady. I do hope shes feeling better. What was wrong with her if you dont mind my asking?
Well Im really glad to hear shes recovered. Stomach bugs are awful  they really take their toll on you.
Why was it boring nothing exciting to do where you live?
Ah yeah that sucks. No time for anything fun.
What kind of operation is it? Im unfamiliar with weight loss surgery. But typically surgeries like that are very safe but it is natural to feel nervous about someone you care about.
Well everyone is entitled to their own life choices. Im sure shell be alright.
Yeah thats never fun. Did you lose at something recently?
I agree it makes you just want to try harder next time.
Thats great what specifically has made it so good for you?
Wow that all sounds very exciting congratulations!
thats so sad oh no! thats terrible.  
They are honestly just like children so its really sad. 
Awww I totally know that feeling. I hate even going on vacation and not being able to bring my dog along. She is family!
I can imagine! Is he doing okay?
It must have been! Have you guys been apart before?
Ah so youve gone through it a couple of months alrready. How much longer is she going to be away for?
You must be so thankful!
They are really wonderful. Do you have plans to show how thankful you are?
When will you be going ?
Wow I hope you have a really nice trip.
just cause of the way they look or you had an incident involving one?
yea im right there with you on that one along with snakes heh
That sounds like a pleasant surprise! 
Thats so sweet of her and what a great memory to have! 
Thats a terrible waste of food how old is your little brother?
Well I hope he soon sees that is not something that he should be doing.
Thats brutal did she get out?
Did she have insurance?
Awful! did you complaint?
Food should be made hygiene. We shouldnt compromise on health.
Thats annoying was it garlic bread?
What did you say to him after he did it?
Thats awesome!  I love getting surprises!  
Thats so sad.  Ive lost dogs before.  I know how you feel 
Yeah dogs are mans best friend.
Yes Ive got one.  Shes a stray that showed up to work one day.
Shes been a great dog. Ive got no complaints or regrets.
Oh wow haha thats not good
Thats an interesting combination maybe you should try to keep him out of the kitchen
What grade is he in?
Awesome! That had to be a great confidence boost for him! 
Thats amazing! How long have you been running?
Thats pretty cool. I hope you win!
Im right there with you.. I still feel pretty introverted but since coming to college Ive been forced to socialize more and its help me at least fake it until I make it. I still prefer to be alone a lot of the time but at least I can somewhat manage without making myself look dumb. Maybe you can just think of some topicsthings to talk about to have in the back of your head for the times when things get quiet?
I hope it goes well! If it makes you feel any better most of them are probably just as nervous and are looking for any excuse to relax and let their guard down too. Good luck
That sounds awesome. Have you ever been before?
I wish I could go sometime that sounds like quite the experience.
Howd it turn out? Congrats on deciding to lead a healthier life by the way.
Im the exact same way in the gym. Music is a huge motivator for me. One time my phone died while in the gym and the rest of the workout was so low energy.
Yeah I have it wasnt serious but I got rearended
Thats terrifying Im so glad youre okay
That is very sad. Did something recently happen to her? 
That is absolutely horrible. I hope she has a moment of happiness very soon. No one should have to deal with that much loss. 
Death by a thousand cuts I call it! Theyll try to make a buck off anything!
Did you try talking to them about it? I can only assume it wouldnt go well but you never know.
Yes I have.  One that actually died and one that was miraculously saved.  It was a dark and tough time.  Did that happen to you recently?
I am soo soo very sorry.  Its so hard to understand everything surrounding a suicide so its hard to be at peace about something that didnt have to happen.  I pray you and your family will find closure and fight for awareness for people who are struggling with those feelings.
Yeah I have. Do you?
It happens. Hope your dog will poop outside soon.
Always sucks when you forget to save it and wake up to a melted blob of brown.
Oh wow! I HATE when you get the urge to eat something and then you get to the fridge only to realize its gone. Do you know who ate it?
Thats horrible! You should tell them as that is their property. What if someone did that to your stuff?
GOOD on you!!
I know how you feel financial problems are rough. I know youll figure out a way to make it.
That really stinks! Dont worry too much though things will work out.
Thats awesome what was in it?
You must be happy to have it back those are the best memories.
Ugh! I hate it when stuff like that happens. Were you able to get a refund on your tickets?
That is very true! Was it bad weather?
i hate that too what were you going to do?
Maybe I could come with you Im near Florida.
Why dont you believe him? He made have been quite the big name back in his day.
Wow that sounds amazing. I wish I could have seen that!
That sounds interesting.  What kinds?
Oh thats awful!
Is that like the child equivalent of under the bed?
Thats kinda strange. I assume thats something hell grow out of.  How old is he?
Wow that took some guts! What made you want to cut it?
And just think about how much youre saving on shampoo and conditioner!
Ahhhh! Ive done that before but I noticed it quick.  Did you not know til the end of the day?
Thats embarrassing ah Im sorry.  Just play it off tomorrow at work! 
Please tell me it was not full of Oriental Trading Company rubber ducks and cheap tchotchkes.
Oh man! I feel bad for laughing but literal garbage is pretty funny. That sucks can you report them to eBay?
Thats good. I was never good at chemistry
I understand anything you need to talk about?
Buck up little camper.
How is she doing
I am happy for you and her
i cant believe christmas is in 4 months its crazy
mine is the fall. halloween thanksgiving....whats not to love.
well the casino won! did you at least get some free drinks?
hah.. at least you had fun it sounds like
I do hate when the lights are off too
I am sure I would too. Just be careful
I am happy for you. Are you excited?
I bet you will be fine. Just be yourself
I am sure you will do well
That must be annoying for you but I love cats.
Oh thats great! Congratulations on your upcoming finish!
Thats amazing. I wish you the best of luck with the remaining classes!
Ohh what happened?
Sometimes things like these happens. Dont worry. But playing hookey is a fun though
I know exactly what you mean.  It gets so lonely on the road.  Have you had to go away recently?
Thats still quite a long ride.  Do you do a lot of long distance biking? 
on to the next one as they say!
have the new chick there when she comes home
Oh yeah.  Ive never seen it I cant watch horror films.  How did you like it?
Ohhh boy.  I hope you have a person or an animal to snuggle up to to help you feel better.
Thats scary when that happens
Some people DO die from choking be safe!
Oh that makes sense well be careful
Whoa that is scary! Did you know him?
I am glad that you are okay!
Hahaha sounds kind of like clickbait
Hahahaha thats so funny
That is weird but amazing! Does it work?  If it does I will get my husband to tape his mouth shut.  He snores like a freight train because his tongue slides back I guess.  Is that true for you?
Do you have any advice on what kind of tape?
That sounds like a nice time!
Wow that worked out perfectly
Did you go over and ask them to turn down the volume?
Well I hope you have some really good earphones  or that they quiet down  its a big egotistical to think that no one around you cares when you are that loud.
I know what you mean. Once I had a bank where the tellers literally had butts for heads. It was so distracting trying to talk to them.
Well it was an upgrade from the bank I had where the tellers were actually robots. I cant believe the costcutting measures in place today!
wow  thats nostalgic!!. It must have brought back lot of good memories
does the machine is in good condition now?
Are they going to pull the tooth?
Thats not strange at all
That sucks. What did you do?
Oh no the poor girl. Was she able to walk afterwards?
Youre a terrific partner. You guys can do something outdoors next time right?
hahaha why was it underwhelming?
lol how do you feel about spiders?
Why were you getting mad?  Were you not lifting as much as you wanted?
I see  I do that too sometimes.  It helps with motivation
You are good at generalizing arent you?
I have no clue.. really I dont!
Thats sounds like a fun trip or 8
that sounds cool.
Wow. I would love to see something like that
What did you name her?
Oh you must have enjoyed it!!
Yeah indeed it must have been then
So cute! What kind of dog is it?
Thats amazing I wish I could get a puppy too but my cat is not friendly
Thats crazy did you ever get it back?
I am so sorry maybe you will have better luck next time.
Eww it may be time to call someone to take care of them.
Oh that had to be super gross! 
At least nothing happened to yo
Thats rough. Did you end up getting the job?
Well theres always next time. At least you can chalk it up as a learning experience.
Thats strange. What did you discover under there?
Oh my! That is repulsive indeed! I wouldve taken it home for dinner. Waste not want not!
Oh NO!  Are you okay?
Yeah I bet!  Did they stop and check on you?
Oh yeah? Is it on par with I Have a Dream?
Woah now! I wasnt thinking of a speech on that grand of a scale! I hope you blow Gimlis beard clean off his face and make 20 horns of Gondor sound!
wow that was really nice of them
Most people now a days wont do that. Make sure to pay it forward!
Thats great man! Did you study hard for it?
Well thats all that matters! Just gotta pass those exams!
Aw thats awesome did it bring back memories?
Yeah its always nice to take a look back and reflect on the early days.
Nice! Who did you go see? Did you catch a homerun?
That sounds amazing. All I have is my lowly Senators sea level stadium...I am mad jealous.
Oh dang. Was she a hoarder? What did you find?
I cant even imagine the stench...did you make out with any buried treasure?
Oh thats terrible.  Is he alright?
That really stinks that that happens.  Are you pretty upset about it?
I do love a smooth ride. What kind of car is it?
Thats awesome! I am mad jealous that you have my dream car!
Wow you were dedicated did you do well on it?
Congratulations all the hard work paid off!
That must of been pretty stressful. But did you get enough sleep?
Sleep is just as important as studying hard. You can kill your performance without it.
Thats terrible! Did you get it back with everything still inside?
At least you have a happy ending for that story.
I agree. I think I am one of them considering I gave my whole life savings to charity yesterday.
Thats really great but I swear it was true! It was a whole 50 cents. Looking back on it I am kinda sad I did it because now I cant buy that fancy fidget spinner at the supermarket. Hopefully some orphan uses it wisely.
Thats good to hear what did she do to make you proud?
Oh wow! Thats amazing im sure that was a really touching moment!
Sorry to hear that. Maybe you can talk with your boss about changing the schedule a bit.
Wow that is a long time! That shows how dedicated you are to your job and that you deserve some time off!
That is awesome.  What are you hoping to do?
Thats the dream to get paid in college.  I wish I could have done that.  Congratulations!
Are you cleaning out a house or do you not have garbage pickup?
That is insane! Ive never heard of anything like that before.  You all should start protesting!
Oh really? What was it they served?
Oh wow... I really cant imagine eating it knowing it had those in it.
I hope she hears some good news. Is it pretty serious?
Ill be praying for her I hope she continues to stay in the clear in the future.
Oh no its awful something happens on that special day that should be full of joy and whatnot.
Yikes. Well at least you did the right thing by passing that long as painful as it might have been. 
am sorry about that what are others doing about it
sorry just tryy to be patient with them
Old school video games are full nostalgic memories for me. That is why i try to avoid them as they evoke many emotions in me
It is just that I miss my friends a lot with whom i used to play. I wish i could just rewind time and go back
I love beer! I wish I could try your guys beer.  Is it a hard process?
Awesome thats great news!  Hope you guys make a great tasting one and become big!
ooh you should not be she should be appreciated for looking good
aha thats funny though
Oh I havent read it but I was also sad to hear he passed
Yes too bad he was struggling with his depression and couldnt seek help
Aw thats so nice of them! Was it fun?
Thats great! Its so nice that you have people around you who care
Ohhh..I would love that experience! How special!
I love that too! I try feeding everyone  Awesome!
Oh geez! Why was she gone for so long?
Thats pretty cool! That would be hard though! Were you all able to talk a lot?
How long have you been there ?
Sometimes we affect people that we dont realize.
That doesnt seem fair. How are they getting around not paying you for it?
It sounds like your boss needs to be more considerate when it comes to his employees.
Wow did you ever get them in trouble?
There you go take victories where you can get them!
Great what is his field ?
I see. I hope for all the best for you and him.
Sounds super relaxing! I bet your enjoying it!
Thats awesome! What kind of soup do you make?
My brother just graduated and is on the job hunt and hes described his experience as the same thing.. Seems like he has good interviews and theyre receptive to him but they dont really respond or give him an answer. Sorry to hear you guys go through that. Cant imagine how frustrating it is
Good on you for being aggressive and opportunistic. Maybe they found that to be the motivating factor to give you the job. I hope its been good so far.
I totally get why you feel that way.  Your time will come soon.
I hope you can recover soon!
Thats good! I bet you missed her a lot.
Im sure shell have a lot to tell you about her trip!
Thats a long time to kind of hang in limbo. I am sorry you had to endure that for a month.
Well at least that story had a happy ending. It could have went much worse.
Aw I bet you miss her a lot.
Well at least the dogs still have you for company. Im sure youll be happy when she gets back though.
Interesting! What kind of things do you do?
aw man that sucks how come he gets to get one but not you
well after a certain age parents start to treat children differently lol
when does she return?
Did you go running like crazy!? 
i would have done the same glad no one got stung! 
They are bad now too they are so annoying
It can be irritating to deal with this time of year
Come on the worst that can happen is that it kills you.
Its certainly a good enough reason to kill them.
Wow are you nervous at all
Thats exciting. Id never have the guts to do it so kudos to you.
That kind of stinks. Sorry to hear that! Well at least there are worst things to forget outside.. Maybe this is an easy learning lesson!
I didnt even think of that! Thats one thing about tea with me that Ive never gotten into it because you get it and its so hot so you have to wait forever to drink it. You set it down and then ultimately forget it!
Yikes that sounds scary but overall good for the end results. How do you feel about it? 
I understand i would be too but now a days technology is really good just make sure its a reliable hospital! 
Thats a good friend you got there.
Never take someone like that for granted. They are so rare.
What types of situations are you referring to?
lol did everyone around you make funny faces?
I am so sorry to hear that. Was she able to go surrounded by you guys?
Its hard to lose a family member like that. You guys should take some time to grieve.
Thats great!  Ive got to deal with loud neighbors too.  Anything specific they do?
Loud running toddler who pitches fits at random times day or night.  Sounds like a similar level of noise P
Oh wow I bet you cant wait! I remember when I had to spend a summer overseas and it was awful to be away from my husband.
Well shell be back soon and youll have loads of catching up to do. I bet the dogs missed her too!
Could you elaborate as to why?
Oh no could you call an exterminator?
Im sure youll do great!  How long have you been training?
Wow thats a lot of dedication!  I believe in you!
i can imagine i have been there and it is the worst just belive in yourself
yeah it always gets bbbetter that is the good thing
That sounds like fun! Ive always wanted to visit India.
Nice. I hope you have a great time!
That sounds like a relief.
It seems like its a lot of ruckus Ive visited friends who have your situation and I can only imagine. 
Glad you enjoyed that short period of peace. Maybe soon you will get new neighbors or you can get a better place.
Oh good. Im sure it will be an improvement from your current situation.
Omg i would have been so embarrassed! O 
thats true imagine if you had! it takes a lot of talent tho to put your pants on inside out and still manage to button them. ha ha 
that is awesome i hope that happens to me on my next trip where where you going
well you are really lucky to have an empty airport
I would go mad were you away at college or in the service?
That is great I am sure he misses you and will be so happy to see you. He will smell you coming and know your there even before you get in the door.
Thats not silly at all! Im sure hell love it.
Yeah hell be all grown up before you know it!
Did it turn out how you expected it
Im glad to hear... Weddings can be stressful
Maybe put the poop back on your neighbors yard?
Its the only way to get them to learn
Thats wonderful its always good when hard work pays off like that!
I bet so that sounds nice
Oh wow that sounds like it was a big mess.
I hope she didnt eat too much of it it might make her sick.
Oh yeah? Did you go give it a try?
Thats a shame. I hate it when a place doesnt live up to the hype.
That can be a bit uncomfortable for sure. Did you try and avoid conversations
If it gets to be too much be sure to walk away.
He must be really strong!
Sure  I strong men is very attractive! You must be proud of him!
That is hard thing to go through. I hope you are feeling better about it now.
I bet. Losing a pet is much like losing a loved one. It gets better but still hurts sometime.
Aw that sucks. But at least he got a job right?
Well hopefully he can schedule another time to come visit you.
Oh my. That is very unfortunate.
I know that feeling. Im sure she is looking down on you all.
That must have been a little bit of a roller coaster. Thats kind of why Im not wild about cats is because theyre so independent and the outside cats can just go hang out somewhere for days and not have a care in the world about you. But I guess that suits some people.
Oh man.. so that was REALLY a roller coaster then. Im so sorry.. I hope youre not overwhelming yourself with guilt about it. It sounds like something you could not have any control over.
My nephew is getting into golf! It seems like a cool enough sport albeit a little expensive. I hope youre able to get back to playing again. Ive taken up running and swimming and its interesting how much those physical activities relieve stress in our day.
Well often people just give up and relegate themselves to just sitting in a chair and watching TV. Even if you have to force yourself at least you are forcing yourself. At some point hopefully you will see progress and feel it getting easier. Once that happens motivation starts to become real easy to get.
Ive never been skydiving myself. I hear that its a great experience but Im not sure if I have the bravery for it.
Oh wow. Is it something that you would do again?
Sounds like fund you must be excited!
I think I will need to do that my TV is an oldy.  I am sure you will have a great time.
That sounds horrible. I would not have been able to sleep after that.
How terrifying. I hope you were able to find and kill it.
Well its okay to be a bit nervous. Interviewers will understand that. You only have to halfway reign in it in and youll hit that happy medium thats good for a workplace interview. Where are you applying to?
I bet you have a good shot at it! Good luck
Did you tell anyone about the dream?
You should call your best friend on the telephone!
That is sure to make you feel the nostalgic?
sounds like a wonderful day!
Oh My!! What are you going to do? I would buy it anyway. 
Well thats unfortunate. Hopefully you will be able to buy it soon. 
It happens to the best of us. It would be great if they did not make us gain weight.
Well you have to live a little every now and then. Im sure it was worth it haha.
Oh no poor baby
Yes cuddles will help
That sounds really fun. Can you still remember some of the routines?
Yea that is a long time. You should reach out to some and see if they are on social media.
Im fascinated by how people can watch golf I always found it really boring but if you enjoy it then great!
Oh that totally changes things I guess makes sense.
Aw thats terrible at least you were able to comfort her?
Im sure you were! Those people deserved some confrontation for sure.
Oh my god! what did you do? did you tell anyone?
LOLOLOL the cops probably had a good laugh about that.
Me too!!! ii never could understand what drives people to be so mean to such innocent creatures. 
Really!! I would go even further and give them the electric chair. I have no tolerance for those types of people. 
Oh I hate it when that happens. Did you find out what it was?
Im glad it wasnt something dangerous. That would be a terrifying experience.
You do? thats good friends can be terrible people to lend too.
I bet he pays you in full.
I bet that was scary. Did he surprise you with something?
Ahhh. How nice. You are lucky to have such a thoughtful husband. 
Does it look like a space ship?
I have never seen a drone flying around here. Even in the day time
What does she do?
Wow I would just tell her its private. Sounds annoying
Aw I understand that I have gone through that myself and its very hard. When did this happen? 
Oh no Im very sorry. What kind of pet? 
Oh no have you been able to calm yourself down?
I can understand that I think I would be a mess too.
That does not sound plpeasant at all maybe they should relocate those who are staying there.
Hopefully no one was injured at all from the accident?
I bet you are thats some pretty good foresight right there! Did you have to use it this past winter?
How satisfying must it be to have something like that ready to go in case of emergency and then to actually get to use it? Im pretty jealous and proud in a vicarious kind of way.
Well good luck with that!
Do roller coasters scare you
I used to be afriad of heights too
Thats a bummer. Maybe next time you can join them.
Sound like a Netflix weekend then. Hope you got a lot of work done.
Goodness youre right about that. Plus a pet is the only thing to show unconditional and neverending love for you.
Im so very sorry for your loss I can only imagine that pain. I had to put my girl down 3 years ago and I promise that it does get easier.
Its the worst waiting for vacations! You want the time before to go fast but then it to go slow during. Never works out that way unfortunately.
Thats great! Im glad you had a good time. Ive never been on a cruise before but it sounds like I need to try one out!
And how is she doing now
That is awesome.  Sometimes a second opinion is all you need
aww thats too bad.  I hope you got some solid netflix in at least!
bummer.  Well I hope you get a chance to do that soon!
Oh that sounds fun!
That isnt good at all glad you didnt have an accident. 
Did you find any good companies.
Did you have alot of accidents that can jack your rates up.
Its okay! Try to rest on the couch and that might help!
I know that feeling all too well. But dont get down on it just try better tomorrow.
That must have been scary.  Is that the first time it has happened to you?
Are you able to do anything to prevent them?
Im sure that he will turn up soon. I really hope that you find him.
Maybe check your local animal shelters? Sometimes they are taken there by people who find them. 
Aww Im sorry to hear that.  Was it a bad break up or did you part on good terms?
Thats really odd.  I wonder why they didnt have the courtesy to let you know that theyd lost interest or whatever the case may be.  To just cut off contact seems a little rude.
How thoughtful.  Now you have to pay it forward as the saying goes.
Kindness is infectious.
How exciting is he a nontraditional student?
That is really good speaking from experience all military men and women should get a degree.
Why? What happened? I hope you didnt get food posioning.
Oh gosh that is gross! Maybe tell the manager so he can make it right and make sure his staff is doing things to health codes!
Oh no! I hope you did not burn yourself.
Hopefully you were wearing dark clothing coffee on light colors stinks!
Oh man! I would have been so scared! 
Ugh thats so annoying. What are they even barking at?
Yeah that would drive me crazy. Sounds like the neighbor needs to control their dogs.
I do that all the time no big deal.
What kind of pizza did you eat?
That is such a relief it is so nice to have money saved up in the bank. 
Oh yeah retirement will come before you know it it is good to be prepared! 
Oh wow now that really is exciting congratulations! Did you get the grade level and subject you wanted?
Teaching little humans will be such a joy. I really hope you enjoy it!
That sucks will she not let you see the dog at all?
Yes that is probably a positive.
Yeah it really does. Its even worse to try and close those accounts!
Man that sounds really stressful...
oh that is awesome. what does she do?
that is great. my sister is an account too. shes also the office manager.
Congrats to your friend! That is an amazing accomplishment.
I would be proud of her too! Hopefully her success continues. You sound like a good friend!
dont be. im sure you raised him right. he will be starting his new adventure
im sure hes cool as a cucumber while you are a nervous wreck. it will be fine.
it will be find. have a little fiath in him and you will see
its very exciting. i wish you both all the best.
I remember that console thats old school.
Those were the good old days!
are you able to get some tutoring or find a study buddy?
thats good.. well you are on your way up!
Thats awesome can we trade?
That is a really good idea. He must be thoughtful to have cooked dinner for you and had it ready unlike mine
that is very true
hopefully its better tomorrow!
Hmm thats interesting tell me more about what that number means to you.
Really my friend had a tarantula as a pet when she was five scared the poop out of me
Are you really able to work from home? Finding a gig is so difficult Im glad that it is working for you.
That is fantastic. Any good new lately?
That is an amazing feeling. 
did you go to the doctor
yuk for sure
Well did you eat her ice cream?
I wonder who actually ate it then.
So are you saying it could be the guy?
You will be fine. Its going to be hard but dont beat yourself up over it.
Then it sounds like you are already ahead of most new fathers. 
That would be pretty cool to see but you should know that typically most cats swish their tail when theyre annoyed or angry! It didnt attack you did it?
Ahh okay. Yeah I dont know. It might have also been scared or feeling like it had to protect its turf. But still thats neat to see and not an everyday thing!
Nice I guess the only times I was nervous to take a test was when I wasnt prepared but theres only so much preparation you can do until you just have to trust your brain or whatever
Wow! You must have like every technique in your toolbox to go for that goal
i bet it does bud I know the feeling. So how do you deal with it
yes i know good memories do help. every relation is a new chapter in the book called our life.
sometimes they cant avoid it 
I cant imagine how scared you must have been.
Not sure. You must be very confused. Did you crash?
Well maybe look at its lifespan? Maybe itll die if you end up not finding it.
what does she draw
Kayla sounds wonderful! How long have you guys been friends?
Finding someone like that is rare. Take good care of that one!
I am sorry to hear that. How far along is it?
Keep a positive attitude. I will be thinking of you!
Did you find out what happened?
Man. That mustve been really nerve wrecking. Did you get any sleep?
did it turn out ok ?
hopes he continues to get better
Im so sorry!  Dont lose hope though. I know some science based nutrition that helps you overcome and kill it going high nutrition plant based vegan.  Look up Dr. Joel Furhman.  Itll save you from all the meds that hurt your body.
I know it must be overwhelming you but coming from someone that is fighting chronic epstein barr virus and Lupus it will change your life.  Check out HIV and going vegan on youtube and thebodycom and so many other resources.  You might be able to reverse it and it wouldnt even be a concern for having kids.  You take care and have hope!
Sounds like youre feeling nostalgic.  What games were you plaing?
Ive never played it but its supposed to havea bunch of old game characters in it
Im sorry I am sure you will be ready next time.
Wait why would you be annoyed by that? Thats amazing!
I think you need to look at the bigger picture though. Someone cured a disease that has caused so much suffering for so many people. Though I suppose to can be both excited for the discovery and jealous at the same time. The two arent mutually exclusive.
What movie did you see
Yeah I have heard bad things to be honest
Wow. Does he usually do stuff like that?
Damn well hes gonna have to learn some boundaries with that.
It is indeed unfair they shouldnt have done that
you are right. But hey people just do what they want to!!
I bet that was awkward
I guess that happens sometimes did you finish the game
That is terrible and a little odd!
Wait you were ok with her cheating?
Yes indeed! what did you do?
You did great! Family comes first. And you gave him your support!
Thats great!!  History is so important I think and so few kids really grasp it well.  Congrats to him for a job well done!
Oh I see what you are saying!  Did he get upset about it?  And you never know he could turn it around next year and blow you away!
Wow is that true? Thats pretty amazing! Id say science should know about your dog.
Wow that surely is incredible! Even the accent too? And intelligent! The full package!
Dang thats a lot of dogs. Cleaned out the pound you did. But that doesnt hold a candle to the 100 I ate yesterday.
How dare you question my intestinal fortitude?!? I would watch out friend. I may just slip some cyanide in your relish if I ever have the chance to challenge you!
That is so nice of him. Are you feeling better?
Thats good to hear. I hope I meet someone that will do that for me.
That would bring the tears. I love looking at pictures especially old ones.
Sounds like you are conflicted. She ran off but shes the best? Are you being sarcastic?
Thats a tragedy! What ever did you do?!?!
Serves her right! These animals cant go around thinking they can poop on our things!
Holy moses he must be as smart as me. I solved that thing in five minutes last week. Childs play.
Yeah thats what they tell everyone because in reality they blew all the prize money on the very same thing themselves. I was pretty peeved that I couldnt even get a dime bag and the sleeziest of hookers.
Ahh thats too bad did you mention it to your boss?
Oh Im sorry to hear that. Maybe next time!
I bet. That is so sad. I am so sorry.
I bet! I hope they can find peace soon.
Time will make it better. You just have to move on.
Better to find out now then move in and invest your time. Trust me its worse.
Really? What kind was it?
Oh I love apple pie with ice cream its such a good combination
Nice I wish I could get a pair of those shoes.
How much did you pay for them?
I love a warm fire outside while camping! Sounds like a great time.
Yes that sounds like a wonderful way to sleep.
That sounds like it could be quite a scary experience.
Oh yeah thats a bit dangerous. Candles are good to have on hang.
Why are you worried?
That is true but Dubai is a bit better
Oh no! Was it still there when you went back?
You never know these days. Luckily there are cameras everywhere.
why? are you having financial problems?
oh god  that sounds horrible but at least nothing bas happened to you!
Oh no what did you do to stay cheerful ?
Sounds good when she got back I hope you schooled her on Halo ?
what kind of health problems ?
im glad you feel good today!
lol! I remember those drills when I was a kid!
And your largest hardback book will protect you from a tornado as long as you put it over your head and sit in the hall!!
Thats normal. Try to just be your self. Im sure it will work out fine.
Amen me too.   I hate my current job.
Its not crazy! Im all about cleaning up. I LOVE the smell of clean house
I find it very satisfactory to clean and vacuum  I bet it will smell so good
Thats good. I know that would be difficult.
That is great. I am sure you are proud and you should be!
Thats always both an exciting time and a nervewracking time. Im in college and I had to move the past two years in a row. This year I decided I kinda had enough and would just stay put even though the apartment was just soso. Do you like it well enough even if the neighbors may give you trouble?
Oh yeah I know the type. Where they sound like theyre having a parade at 3AM. Sorry you had to go through that. Luckily or unluckily if you want to see it that way I have a loud window AC unit in my apartment so even if they did make noise I couldnt hear them over it!
Oh wow that is a huge commitment! How did it go?
That is really awesome! Im glad it all worked out for you!
Yes I feel like that every time I look at old pictures!
I agree and time jut goes by too fast!
Do you reach out to your friends from your childhood?
Exhaust all options social media is a big way to stay connected
Wow!  What was in the package?
That was really nice!  What a wonderful surprise!  This act of kindness helps to restore my faith in humanity.
Nice do you still keep in touch with her
Well if you stay in touch then Im sure shell come back...but in the meantime try to take your mind off her or get involved in something fun so you have cool stories to tell her
What book do you enjoy reading?
No actually Im under a lot of stress right now and Im in pretty dire straights financially. The only book im really reading at this time is the Bible.
Where is your home village?
Thats a shame. Im sorry to hear that.
Do you live in the United States now?
Yes it sounds like it was a great place to grow up.
I love dogs! What breed is he?
Thats so sweet! We have blue healers they just make the world better.
Oh my goodness that must have been terrifying until you figured out what was going on.
Well at least you had a good time.  Did they do something nice for you after?
Do you ever offer to help thm?
GOod for you I feel bad for never helping out.
Awesome.  What are you going to do with the money.
Dont spend it all in one place 
Putting it away for a rainy day is the best bet.
Haha thats a nice way to enjoy a sad moment how are you feeling recently?
Im happy to hear youre doing better. If you feel that way again please reach out.
Oh my you must have been annoyed with your cat. I guess he just wanted your attention.
Aw hes just a kitty after all. Im sure he didnt mean to make you mad.
What prize was it or what was the competition rather? Im interested to know but dont want to pry if you dont feel like saying.
Ah gotcha. Its good to see that you tried and that you care that much. Most people are too lazy or scared to compete in things myself included. I hope you continue to do the things that make you competitive and interested.
Was it any good?
Sometimes the cheap things are the best
I bet it is! When my grandma was alive it was so heartbreaking to see her in pain. She broke her hip right before her death and she just couldnt recover
i hope she will recover soon. Stay strong and think positive
where is that ?
isnt that where bruno is from ?
Thats great that they accomplished that and even better that you recognize their achievements.
OK I didnt realize that they may have gone after you were born as opposed to before.
I am prepared to go camping tonight in the woods
That sounds peculiar. Ive never known a dog with such finesse yours may have talent.
Thats really cool it makes me want to consider getting a dog.
what did she do ?
wow that was nice of her
What kind of gaming is it?
Thats sounds interesting!
Id imagine so.  How long have you been a sky diving instructor for?
Aweseme.  I want to go skydiving sometime.
wow thats a good job
That sounds frustrating. How did it affect you?
Ooh that would be aggravating. I guess there isnt much you can do.
Best of luck! What are you bidding for
Archie? marvel? dc?
Sometimes dogs just bark a lot. Did anything happen?
Thank goodness. Id be scared too. You cant really know whether a dog is harmless or not sometimes.
It has what did you see that impressed you?
Theyre more powerful than that. More like an early 2000s computer.
What did i tell you about doing that. It was a chocolate cake right?
Ok at least it was the right kind of cake you liked. But still not a good thing.
That is really great.  You dont find too many people willing to help others financially.  Do you have a really good job?
Its good just to have enough these days.
Which film was it?
I havent heard of it sounds interesting though.
Thats good. I live in a small town but we have a big shopping center across the street and there are all the stores i love 
wow even organic store? thats pretty cool
Really? It doesnt bother me at all. I wonder why you feel that way?
Well most people have intense likes and dislikes. Personally I cant stand cigar smoke but some people love it! I guess in your case you need to scrape the food off the plate first.
I can imagine they are a right pain to pick up after!
What an annoyance!
Oh me too. Im not a driver but that is so annoying.
It can be really dangerous too
That is terrible.  Was it dead or just injured?
That is true.  I would hate for people to be shooting things that close to my house too.  Do you know who it was?
Whats been holding you back?
Thats a tough decision to make. Its good to try new things sometimes and Im sure the waiters can recommend you a nice meal youll enjoy based off your preferences.
That is very cool!  I love when food is authentic.  Do you shop there often?
I have never tried making Indian food myself but I do really enjoy Indian restaurants.  I am jealous.  
Thats awesome!  Have you gotten any better yet?
That would be cool.  Hopefully the hard work will pay off
Urgh that sounds like the worst! How early?
So inconsiderate! It reminds me of my neighbours doing building work one morning at 6AM!
How many times do you need to tell them!? 
I tend to believe that those who have Biblical faith do have a certainty that God will bless them despite circumstances. 
Oh really when are you going to go see her?
I hope you have a good time at the concert and she sings all the songs youre looking forward to.
Congratulations! That must have been such a great feeling.
I cant wait for the day I move out into my own place!
I do I live with my parents because Im in university and Im still pretty young. Hopefully by next year!
Those are my nightmares. They are so big where I live in the South.
I would immediately start spraying bug spray all over. Those things terrify me. 
I dont know how you do it. I cant stand long drives.
Definitely not! Music is a great idea though I listen to music on all bus rides and car rides.
Thats awesome.  What kind of computer are you getting?
very nice.  Id be super excited too.  Have some fun playing with it
Yeah it is really nice to have other people do your shopping
Shopping is no fun waiting in lines is not fun.
I havent heard of that movie. Whats depressing about it?
Oh dear. I think Ill give it a miss  I cry at the drop of a hat! You should watch a comedy next just to cheer yourself up!
ohhh cute!! i am so happy for you smart boy!
a rare one i hope he goes a long way and maybe even be the next Einstein we need
Sounds painful did you have to go to the doctor?
oh god that must have been the worst way to wake up in the morning
oh do you have any revenge planned?
That is really scary!  What was it?
Yuck!  Stay away from that guy!
Sounds like quite an adventure for one semester! What was your favorite place?
Nice! Must have made you really happy to see so many different places.
Lol! I thought you were going to say MESSY! Good kids!
So true! Maybe they want something or they did something bad and are hiding it lol
Lol  Well enjoy the clean house dont worry about the rest!
oh awesome i love ziplining last time i went was 3 years ago tho how did you find it?
did you enjoy yourself 
Ouch sucks to be you! jk Did you ice it down
Yes hope you feel better
Oh no. I have been there before. It was really sad.
It is sometimes for the best but that doesnt always make it easy. 
How did you do that? Naturally or with chemo?
I bet! Look in too Chlorella and similar to get rid of any toxins from the chemo 
oh yeah? where you planning to move to?
oh thats a very good reason to go i am happy for you 
this is what you need to do get out of your car and go give them a beat down that they need
yea but it will feel better if you take action
That sounds dangerous! You should try to move
You really should! With things like that happening you could get seriously injured
Cool! That sounds like a great time!
Wow thats pretty deep!
Wow that had to be quite a surprise.  I hope you like them
Well thats good.  Hopefully it was a good party!
What brand are they?
That is crazy did you go return them maybe?
and what happened?
how long is a marathon?
Oh no! I hope no one took it!
Did you go back for it and get it?
Wow ! thats quite an accomplishment. How long did you have to practice to perfect that ?
Fantastic ! When you get older your memory tends to play tricks on you lol
Oh really? Any interesting ones?
Thats awful! Sounds like it might have caused you some trauma unfortunately.
Did you catch the person after?
That is unreal what did you have in the bags?
oh my gosh. what happened to him?
i bet is was. are you ok?
Oh my god that is a LOT of weight!
Thats really cool I honestly cant even imagine someone lifting that much!
Ive been to one before with my girlfriend what an amazing experience eh?
Arent you the luckiest? 
Really? What was it?
Oh gross! I would be startled too!
You must be mad at the cat for that.
You got too my cats dont do that thankfully.
I am so sorry to hear that. We need memories of our fur babies to help us in our grief. 
People do not realize that Animals can get cancer too.  Its more common than we may think. 
That sounds nice. Its always good to remember better times. What kind of music?
Ha I used to listen to that stuff back in high school. The My Chemical Romance gets me every time.
Guess you dog isnt one thats going to take the bullet?
lol Ive never seen an armadillo but that sounds freaky!
Did you help it?
I hope it gets better! That sounded harsh
what do you all have planned
that sounds nice must be a really good friend
What a fantastic feeling. Where you expecting that?
Well then. What a great surprise. It sounds like you deserved it.
For what kind of project?
Did you tell them to leave you alone?
what about doing something you enjoy? 
i know it can be tough but maybe trying something new or outside your comfort zone might give you an enjoyable experience
What is parvo?
Thats terrible. Can you confirm it?
I hope she is okay. 
How ever so exciting! is this your first cruise?
I hope you have a great trip and cherish the time with your family!
well that was mighty nice of them you wash dishes ?
this summers weather has been really intense here and honestly a little scary
i hope it doesnt get too bad near you
Why did he get called back in?
Wow did he get paid for it?
my sister loves mac and cheese. she would probably live off of that if given the chance
i like paprika in my mac and cheese
What kind of necklace did you purchase? Its good to treat yourself some times.
You will just make sure you have your nice new shirt on with that cool necklace and you will be all eyes lol.
It could be a medical problem. Make sure its checked out.
Ohh I see. That is super annoying. Hopefully she gets over this phase and they get along.
You must have really proud of yourself. Its good to acknowledge your own achievements from time to time.
I agree which is why getting into that position can be so gratifying. Hopefully you maintain that level of hard work that got you there.
sounds like a great time hopefully its not too hot out there
That sounds like heaven to me as well
I have a cat too close to me they are the best
Oh thoughtful ! Did she enjoy playing with it ?
Its quite wonderful to share your childhood memories with your children isnt it ?
Congratulations. Are you going on a hollywood
Well I am happy for you
That is terrible. Why do you think that he will lose his job?
I understand. That is very stressful. Did he started looking for another jod? It could be solution.
Thats sad. I love cats
How old was the cat?
Thats awesome. Did she?
I bet you are so proud. I would definitely be
What happened after your car crashed?
Flies are so annoying
I had that problem with a mosquito once. I woke up with a bite on the tip of my nose
I would have hated to clean that up. I wonder why they do that?
Yea that is so gross but also kind of funny. I cant help but laugh.
Do you have to give a big speech soon?
Thats the way to go! Practice and practice until youre confident and then the real thing will be a breeze.
That is horrible. Does he puke up hairball often?
I bet it was very embarrassing?
Its alright weve all been there many times.
What kind of pizza is it?
Thats never good I love pizza
Oh no! That must be so frustrating being in a foreign country
Im glad you eventually found it and didnt have to sleep somewhere else.
Ahh it happens. I used to swim competitively so I would sometimes get stunned too when I hear the gun go off
Ahaha I hate running too
Huh ok.  Do you like her a lot?
Sounds like you dont have much respect for women.  
Sometimes the simplest things are the nicest
I hope you have many more then!
What did you do in response?
Thats awful did you get injured at all?
That is a terrible tragedy my friend. Did the dog get sick?
Well thats good. What did you find?
Did you ask him to turn it down?  Or did you just go flip the circuit breaker to the house?
Did he do it?  Cause if not I might have needed to give him a high five on the head with a chair.
That is pretty disgusting! Did it look like poo coming out again?
I can imagine. Maybe itll morph into a Super Saiyan poo or something.
Thats a dang shame. Did it get rained on?
Thats too bad. Well on the bright side maybe a hobo will find it read it enlighten himself and get a job at McDonalds.
Wow that must have been a surprise for you
you got a great husband
I know how you feel its terrible. I actually moved to a completely different state due to hi taxes.
Its worth it to consider. I pay less than half in property tax than I used to.
Always do the same what? What is perfect?
I have been married for 19 years and we have been together 21.
Ive been through that process before and it was not easy. Good thing you had a good adviser.
You have been very lucky. You should keep their business card in case you ever decide to buy another house.
Thats how it goes. I usually consider the money as a lost cause when lending to friends.
I have too... to pay for food though. She told me that she would have paid if I asked but I am too proud.
Sounds like found!   Are you scared of roller coasters?  I love them!
I hope you do have fun!
I know how you feel! Our dog of 8 years past away last week spring. It can be so hard 
Same here. We dont know. He was perfectly fine the night before. We woke up to find him passed away at the foot of our bed. Do you know how yours passed?
What kind of thing?  You could always change that in the future.
Of course but that is certainly not the most important thing in life I hope you realize now.
Thats such a great feeling.
That sounds really nice. I dont know my neighbors at all
I watch everyday. love youtube!
I like self help motivation healthy living and a little bit of conspiracy.
Oh I get those midnight cravings all the time!
You want cake? Cake is there? Obviously you have to eat it! Lol
That sounds like a fun thing to do as a couple.
Why were you so scared?
Oh really that sounds nice. I miss childhood.
Sometimes I feel as though our generation assuming youre a few years around 30 really got a bad deal as far as the economy politics and the overall love in the country is concerned.
Things work out. It doesnt seem like it but they do.
It will. I am sure of it.
Is the city going to build them new ones at least?
Well at least they bought them out and they wont be homeless. Still sucks though.
Oh no! How badly did you hurt yourself?
That doesnt sound too bad it could have been much worse! 
Yes I do play some video games.
Ive heard some very good things about it. It doesnt come out until November right?
Sometimes life isnt very fair. I like to think of it as motivation to get a better job.
It happens I think its part of human nature. Just try and focus on your own wellbeing and youll be alright!
Good for you!.  My year have been ok too so far.
You seem to be very hopeful!  That is great.
Im so glad to hear that! Did anything in particular make it a good day? Mines been awesome too!
Sick congratulations! Time to celebrate right?
How awful besides painful it must have been scary!
Were you messing with them maybe? or taking their honey?
I do as if it were yesterday. I remember most of my childhood through video games.
I really want to but unfortunately my GameCube and N64 no longer function. Also a few of my favorite games are scratched to heck.
Im glad to hear that! Things are really going great for me too!
Same here. Lets hope these good times stick around real long!
You barely even know her what was she thinking?
I really hope she doesnt do anything bad to you. You seem like a nice dude.
So what happened? Did you end up ordering some once you both remembered?
People make mistakes it happens. 
Oh nasty! That must have been a heck of a pain to clean.
I wouldnt have thought it would be so easy thats good!
Im so sorry for your loss it isnt easy losing a pet. How are you doing?
Understandably so. I hope you feel better soon.
Sounds pretty interesting.  How was it? Did you like it?
Wow That much!   Were you afraid to be trapped like those poor boys in Thailand?
Those always make me nervous too. I hope it goes well for you!
Well I hope they said you could have it.
You could always replace it for them since you know you shouldnt have taken it.
Are you scared of heights?
I bet that was the ride of your life.
I think those are very important lessons. Do they always listen?
Im a parent and I wish the exact same thing.
Not entirely but I do know depending on the game it can take hundreds of people.
As a gamer Id love to know more about the games that take that long to make. Which ones?
Oh man! I hate one night stands!!
Oh. Yeah. Probably not haha.
That sounds like fun how was it?
I bet!  When I got to family reunions theres always so much reminiscing
Ooh did you go ahead and go through with it?
Nice thats a good idea. Good luck!
Was she nice?
May I ask what a cryptokitty is? I am unfamiliar.
Does he ask for money a lot or is this a first?
Do you like skydiving?  I would be terrified!
haha thats true but you can also live with your feet on the ground!
Haha thats hilarious! Where was it at on your shirt?
Oh no! I hope your coworkers went easy on you about it. You mustve had a lot of static electricity.
How awful!  Do you know who did it?
Yes at least there is that.  But it must be really scary to deal with someone willing to go that far.
It must have been a very difficult  speech specially since I imagine you were really sad and moved.
Of course  do you feel prepared to do it then?
Wow. Thats quite the feat nowadays. Do you still enjoy it?
Is it a never worked a day in your life situation?
Oh wow yes I would imagine that is fun. I am jealous.
That is no good!  Did you manage to get on it?
That is lucky.  At least you made it home the same day.
LOL I bet you couldnt move after that.
I bet although with chinese you can eat it again in an hour or so.
Sounds very nice you must have felt nostalgic for the old times right?
Yes me too it is for that reason I avoid looking and old pictures when I dont want to go that way.
That sounds terrible! you must have been devastated!
It was a terrible way to comes to term with dead Im so sorry you have to go through that.  I hope time have healed you.
I love when Im at a restaurant and that happens. Happy Birthday by the way!!
Everyone always looks so happy and it makes people around you happy but I understand not wanting to be in the spotlight
Congrats! It is nice to find someone with things in common. Shared interests can be fun.
Im on my 2nd as well. I like to think that we will do things more wisely the second time around. best of luck to you both!
Oh that is the worse.  Dis you find it at any point?
And who was right in this case?  Dis anyone turned it in?
That is so sweet of you! How was your experience?
I bet it feels good to know that youre helping those in need too!
That is awesome having a significant other and a good job can make a huge difference! 
Those times can help shape you and make you appreciate the good times even more!
It is always awesome when work and married life get along without getting in the way of each other. 
Oh no! Did it do any meaningful damage?
OUCH. New car is cheaper than replacing the engine?
Yeah I get that. Plus I guess the value goes way down doing something like that.
Ouch! That must have hurt.
Dont worry people wont remember within a few months.
Thats what I was thinking.
Yes I know I am like that too I cant wait for my new stuff to arrive I feel like a child on Christmas waiting for Santas gifts.
I guess it is kind of fun anticipating the arrival of the packages.
How sad to lose a dog you love! Ta least shehe died of old age she must be in doggy heaven.
I know how you feel there must be two of them though because my dog is the most wonderful dog ever too!
That sounds like a great way to spend the weekend.  What type of boat are you thinking about renting?
Absolutely nothing like unwinding after the work week.  I hope you
Wow must be nice. My parents were really poor still are. 
Yeah me too. I like that though I like earning my way. 
I often dream about winning the lottery!
Hey good for you! That takes stamina. What was the project?
Well done! That was a challenge. 
It always feels good to wrap up a big project. 
Thats awful!  Will you be feeling better any time soon?
I am so glad you have doctors that you can trust!
Uhoh. Hopefully you were able to stick to your diet throughout the week though. One off day aint so bad. 
That sounds it. As long as you keep with it though results have to happen. The hardest part of dieting has got to be the hiccups anyway. 
Thats an amazing accomplishment!  Im sure youll do great!  Have you been studying a lot?
I hope you can stay calm you seem really well prepared!
Oh nothat did not go welllso sorry about that
Thats good dearcongratulations
It is very important to have a good support system with health issues especially if there are many. It helps to know that you have people that are there if you need them.
Health problems can have a devastating effect on a person if they are alone so it is wonderful that you have love and support.
Oh. Im sorry. How old was your dog?
Have you thought about getting another dog? 
its a hard decision you can be apprehensive about making the right decision you know?
yeah they are! So that is really good!
That sounds amazing! Howd you guys meet?
Oh wow thats awesome. Is your sister as happy with her husband as you are with yours?
Did you hurt yourself? 
Hahahah! Im dying! Im glad you werent hurt.
Oh that sounds so exciting! What do you plan to see while you are there?
The Smithsonian would be amazing. I have not been to DC yet. I hope you guys have a great time!
Oh thats really nice to have something you can remember him by. It must be very special to you. 
Thats very sweet. I am certain he is with you. 
Oh my. I am so sorry. That must be so difficult. Are you exploring any other options like adoption? 
I hope you are able to have a child some day. I truly hurt for anyone that struggles in situations like this. I have to aplogize in advance. The topic I chose was about my daughter. I do not want to make you feel sad. 
Did you go for the interview?
I no how you feeI I have had to live in worse places than that  but it looks like you found a way out of that situation.
I had to squat in houses before. Im glad things have changed for you and for me.
Wow. Thats amazing. Were you afraid to try it?
Do you often feel like you want to be in control? Cause i totally do.

That is crazy. Did you not have insurance for all these years you missed the dentist appointments?
I hope the problem was not deep in the enamel of the tooth since that requires a lot of work.
The internet is a great thing. I dont know what wed do without it.
We had an issue with our internet for a couple of days and it was so inconvenient!
Ive never felt that way myself. What do you find relaxing about watching animals sleep?
I suppose when you feel tired anything can feel relaxing
Really? Im so sorry to hear that
Hope everything gets better soon
Me too I really miss those days.
If only time machines were real.
Its good to remember days gone by
Yea like you can remember those times but things are different
Taht is always a weight off the shoulders Im glad you are pleased.

That is unfortunate he is a scumbag. I hope you find yourself a nice and wealthy boyfriend!
Tennis how fun! Have you noticed improvement?
Thats magnificent! Ive never played tennis myself but its a sport Ive always enjoyed watching.
That is to bad is it someone you have been with a long time?
Wow that is really messed up. Did you end up leaving them?
also nostalgic ey? i get you those easy days no stress no limits anything is possible 
i wish we could go back to those days... 
Im so sorry you had to go through that! What happened?
Im sure it was a very difficult experience. you must be a really strong person to have gotten through that.
Nice! How long do you go to the gym for?
I never even leave the house! I am the opposite of you!
That is unfortunate what do you usually avoid talking about?
Well I hope one day your parents are more accepting!
Oh no I am so sorry to hear that. Are you planning on getting  a new dog? 
Aww yeah I know what you mean. Dogs are so lovable. I also have a new pup myself. I got him a couple years ago
Oh my what happened? Im so sorry no one should treat anyone they care about poorly.
Im sorry hun you deserve to be treated better than that. I hope you know that.
Im so sorry that is the worst feelings. I had to put my dog down as well. I know you did the right thing.
Cats are really some of the greatest companions. How old did she live?
Thats good some things just take time
I can imagine. How did things turn out?
Im so glad you made it through
Great what will you be doing during your time off ? 
I agree with youyoull feel good about yourself being productive !
That must have been exciting to see her after so long. Does she live very far away?
Thats a shame. Does your sister have a bad impression of your boyfriend after having dinner with you?
I love buying new clothes! Where do you think youll wear it to?
How exciting! I bet youll look flawless!
how has that been going for you?
thats good! excitement and nervousness are both the same so its very hard to tell but its amazing you are able to convert all the bad feelings into positive ones! good luck 
Thats a great feeling. Going in knowing youll do well and then actually doing well.
Ingenuity like that will reward you in the real world. Academia is a system and if you game it youve won.  
Oh no! I would be very furuios!
I would be devastated! Maybe he wont do it agian.
Oh wow I bet that was nice. Hopefully yall had a good talk.
Well that is fantastic. Hopefully yall will be able to meet up in the future real soon too. 
That sounds amazing. How are you planning to relax?
That sounds very relaxing. Dont forget the snacks for netflix!
that could possibly indicate that you are a free creature! and you dont like to be caged! dont worry about it the dream as they are only metaphorical
Dont worry youre wearing clothes now arent you? 
Wow that is great for your friend! and dont stress it we are still young and have plenty of time to save up for a house!
Wow that is crazy I know how you feel the best solution is to probably find a cheap place to rent out until it is possible to buy one. 
why is that? comfort ?
OH NICE! THATS SOUNDS SO AMAZING I love watching lord of the rings every now and then did you watch all the sequels all over again?
Wow that must have been nice to catch up. When was the last time you saw your friend?
Seeing old friends that you have not contacted in so long is a nice feeling. 
Really!? That is very unprofessional of them to make you wait for so long.
That is frustrating. You should complain to them.
Oh no I am sorry that you have been having a rough time but I am glad to hear that you have grown from your experiances.
Yeah I believe that you will be able to but never forget you are not alone! I am always here if you need some moral support 
I agree. So often does pride get in the way of personal growth and reflection.
Youd hope folks would grow up but sometimes people get set in their ways and become impossible to change.
Oh no what did they say? 
That is really creepy I would feel anxious too. I think you should report the to the police if you notice any strange or threatening messagesFeel free to also call me if you need anything! 
That sounds fun and scary! You must be pretty fit to take on that challenge.
Im sure that there will be some differences but Im sure you will nail it! Just remember to be safe!
oh my what are they about?
wow sounds like some inception plot line you need to learn how to control the dream
Sound like youre making a lot of progress!
Thats great! All the hard work is paying off.
Congrats that must have been a very stressful time leading up the the birth.
You sound like a great mother. Im sure your son is very lucky to have you.
Wow that sounds challenging! You must have some serious strength to pull that off!
You should definitely try! It would be tough but if you have the determination it would be so worth it.
Oh no! You should try to make some more friends with your classmates.
I hope youre able to find some friends in the next semester then!
Yeah that sounds hectic. You think you can do it?
Yeah sounds like a handful! Maybe you should weigh your options and do whats best for you adn your family. 
That is great to here!
Not at the moment. Im too focused on bettering myself.
Im from the south too! Are you talking about mosquitoes by any chance?
One day well find a way to repay them all the misery theyve caused us.
Keep up the good work! You will do good in life and be a good role model for your kids. 
They will notice how caring you are! Dont ever cut yourself short!
That does sound like a good friend. How long of a drive is that?
Youre lucky to have such a good friend!
Oh no! Ive been there. How did it happen?
Im glad your safe! Those roads can be dangerous.
I hope that your relationship continues to strengthen.
I agree. Life is short and having these relationships is very important
Oh no! I hope it dont bite anyone. That can be nervwrecking.
Im glad it worked out well. I bet your finally content with her being around other rats. 
Thats neat and sounds like a lot of fun!
I have not been in years! Was it as fun this time as it was years ago?
What kind of pet is it? Hope your animal is okay!
I heard rats make awesome pets Im so sorry! Is your rat in pain?
Im sure with the help and support he will be alright..
Definitely I think so too time and right care.
Oh my! I hope you were the only one there! otherwise that would have been scary!
Oh my god! How embarrassing! Looksl like you will stay inside for awhile.
Wow thats so sad. Hopefully a new love will come to you!
Sure its never too late. And you never know whats gonna happen soon.
Very nice! I bet your very proud of it and are excited for what may come from it.
I bet you worked very hard on it! It will be great!
Wow! That sounds exciting! Have you traveled around the world a lot?
Traveling is the best way to learn about other cultures. You are very fortunate to get the opportunity. 
I agree we need more moral people to guide us.
Lets hope they find their way to the top soon for our sake.
Oh Im sure. At least everything ended up alright though.
Oh man thats funny and terrible at the same time.
Yeah I would keep away from him for another 2 months or so.
wow thats an amazing woman. did she rub off on you any?
thats pretty cool of you. i hope to have a daughter like you someday
Oh thats exciting! Are you nervous at all?
Oh wow it sounds like you really love them. Im super happy for you! I hope it goes exactly how you planned. You sound like a good father.
oh man. its always tough to lose a parent. how old is she?
yeah i bet. at least you got to know her for as long as you did
yep shes want you to remember that even if she cant remember it herself
thats very dangerous  driving and being exhausted did you manage to get home safe?
im glad you didnt 
Thats nice to hear.  Its always a good thing in a marriage to show each other support through thick and thin.
Im sorry to hear that.  Just knowing that he has you to lean on probably goes a very long way in helping him get through that.
Oh no! Were you envious because you liked her yourself or because you dont have a wealthy husband?
It can be you you just have to work hard for it.
i feel bad for your friend. did you tell her?
oh god that sounds terrible
oh thats so embaressing 
why are were you scared? dont be next time stand up and ask your teacher you want to go to the toilet otherwise you will wet your pants
Thats hilarious! Is he usually down for a good prank?
Well thats fair. If he pulls them he has to be willing to have them pulled on him too.
I can understand that. Its a tough trip to make but hopefully youll be able to soon.
and how was it? did you enjoy it?
That sounds like so much fun! I love parties!
Hey I just had that one! What do you have planned?
That sounds like fun! Are you looking forward to seeing anyone in particular?
Well I hope shes there. Maybe shell regret how she treated you.
Oh no! Hurricanes are scary.  Ive been through a few myself.  Was it your first one?
I lost power in our last hurricane for 3 days.  Did the wind do any damage to your home?
In the end Id rather be  in a hurricane than a snow storm.  lol
Wow  you are a vegetarian? 
This is serious.  For me  I dont joke with meat
that mustve made you so furious
you sure are a very strict parent.
Thats great! Im sure youll be well prepared. 
Then I am sure it will go well for you. What is it in?
Wow  what happened to her eyes? 
Ohhh sorry about that. It is well. 
Thats got to be an amazing feeling to have going for you. How do you feel?
Its going to help your family out so much I bet everyone is so proud of you congrats you deserve it.
Thats rough Im sorry to hear that
I am sure you will find someone who will love you even more than your ex did soon.
Thats too bad you have to go out and make new friends.
Suck it up and get out there it is the only way or you will end up very lonely.
Oh Im so sorry to hear that!
Is there somewhere you can go for extra help with that course? A tutor or something?
Thats so annoying.  I hate it when that happens.
Can you block her out maybe?  Get some noise blocking headphones?
The ones with the little colored sliders on the end? Those were cool!
I liked them too.
Has it been on the market for long?
Wow! Thats awesome. Im sure youll sell soon.
oh thats too bad what did you end up doing
you should defently and dont let this affect you too much maybe she has a good reason
that must have been an explosion and a half did  you clean it up?
i can imagine thats gross as hell
oh no! thats terrible! Ive had that happen before and it sucks
I can imagine. did they steal anything?
I know what you mean.  I love to see all the pictures and think back to how little mine used to be.
They do seem to be grown before you know it.  Make you wonder how if goes so fast!
Sometimes its ok to indulge. Did it give you a stomachache though lol?
You should follow up with a few veggies later on maybe to balance it out. I know that feeling though. Its just so good you cant eat just one lol
Im so sorry for your loss! Its so hard to lose a parent.
Sadly I dont think we can ever be prepared for that kind of loss.
Wow  thats so nice of you
That is cool.  You are really so caring 
Oh darn that sucks.  Keeping a positive attitude is the way to go! Im sure something is out there for you.
And here the job market was supposed to get great again.  lol
Oh no! Can you replace it?
Im sure your friend will be understanding that it was a mistake.
oh no I am sorry to hear that! They must have been really busy and it must have slipped their mind
I am sure they had their reasons maybe you should give them a call and see if everything is alright. They may be going through their own problems right now. 
I agree. The sound of birdsong a gentle breeze on a summers day the purring of your tabbycat. You cant beat that can you?
You should! Forget about your worries if only for a moment. Youll return feeling refreshed.
Yikes thats not a fun situation. Did you figure it out pretty quickly?
Thats good Id be mortified if that happened to me.
Ive had that happen before. My cat is definitely more my wifes cat now. Does he still cuddle up with you?
Haha same for me. Its like as soon as my wife is available to sit or lay with Im chopped liver.
Im sorry for your loss I bet you two were close. What did he leave you?
Oh he worked for congress? Thats very interesting. That sounds like an awesome haul of vintage stuff.
That was kind of you! Has his truck been repaired?
Of course! Your dad is very trustworthy.
Can you please give a little more detail about what happened at your friends house that made you not want to show your face??
How embarrassing! I did that one time when I was sleeping in my bed and I thought I got up and went to the bathroom to pee but I did not go to the bathroom I peed my pants in the bed. 
That is so cool my mother in law has bears come into her yard! Id be happy with the hummingbirds so pretty.
The squirrels keep stealing the feed in my birdfeeder they do trapeze to get to it.
Thats amazing! We just got a new puppy this last weekend also! What kind is yours?
Aw that is super cute! Dogs bring such happiness to a home.
Oh man Im really sorry you have to go through that. Betrayal like that is so painful. How are you doing?
Of course no one deserves to have their heartbroken like that. I hope you find someone who treats you with the respect and kindness you deserve.
Sugar is very addicting! Im glad you could make it
Caffeine headaches are no joke.
Sounds like you were just misunderstood. I discuss things with my husband too and its not like talking behind someones back. Thats what married couples do. Dont feel bad. 
Yes just tell her your home is a safe place to talk. Its okay to open up in the family. 
Awesome! Did you play any of them after you found the box?
Neat! I havent played them. Even though everything is becoming digital I find there is something special about the physical copies!
Ugh sorry! You must be disappointed. But remember if the door doesnt open it probably wasnt yours. Theres something else in store for you!
Sometimes they already have a candidate in mind but have to go through the motion...the same thing happened to my husband. Your time will come.
I cant even imagine how devastating that would be. I think you must be really strong to be able to move forward.
You might but I believe you can have a full life as a single person too.
Wow! A 20 foot boat that must be amazing to take out on the lake! How much did it cost you?
Id love to own a boat are you using it for leisure or fishing etc? 
They both sound like great plans! Tubing would be a great way to keep her happy while you fish haha!
I hope you do! It makes you feel like youve actually earned it!
Im always leery of loaning money to friends
That was a nice surprise!  I have tried lending money to friends but finally had to stop after never getting it back
Oh no! How sad! Did you ever find him?
Oh how awful! Im so sorry!
Wow very cool. The last time i tried to skateboard i almost broke my tailbone. props to you though!
Is it though? haha. If you can do it without falling down then you are doing better than me. Probably a good bonding experience id imagine. 
Too bad for them! My sons 6th birthday was just last week and we had a fun party. There so much easier to please when their little lol.
They do. I cant believe how fast the time goes.
That must have been aggravating! Job hunting is so hard.
Maybe something better will come along!
Well I hope you got there in time and nothing bad happened.
Oh know! I hope you werent heading to a job interview haha.
Im so sorry. Have you tried any natural remedies?
I hope you find something that gives you some relief!
Thats awesome. Did you get him it? I bet he loves it.
Haha I wouldve done the same. Those toys always make me lose myself. Theyre so much fun!
Wow you were lucky! It has happened to me before too. It feels so violating.
Because you were not in it. 
That is so nice of you all! I know she appreciates it.
Aww Im so sorry but know you made a difference in her life.
that is good! did he make any friends?
That is really cute!
Thats awesome! Whats your secret to success?
Well he seems to be guiding you in the right direction. I hope your blessings continue!
First day of school I remember my kids first day of school how did it make you feel?
yes it does but we always got or memories.
Neither could I.  It was the first thing that was on the news right after I woke up.
Yea I try not to think about that though because then it makes me sad.
That sounds amazing! How long does it take to make the beans? Do you have to soak them? 
I can smell the beans and sausage as we speak.. I always find after cooking Im never hungry. Maybe thats because I snacked the entire time I was cooking.
Oh no.  In those cases its either the best news or the worst news.
Im sorry to hear that.  Unfortunately I know that same feeling all too well.
Woo hoo! That is awesome! Congrats! When will you find out

Do you like cats? Kittens are the best!
Yes I love cats as well I have one orange one and 4 dogs that get along pretty well all together
Congrats!  How long have you been playing the cello?
How did you place in the competition?
Oh dear thats embarrassing! I hope you didnt hurt yourself. 
Oh ha! I guess thats painful!
I am sorry. Breakups are the worst. Did he just not want to give up overtime or he worked 70hours always?
Thats rough but you deserve someone who is willing or wants to make the time for you. Never settle for less than what you are willing to settle for.
Why did yall break up?
That doesnt leave much time for yalls relationship
Oh darn I hate when that happens! Ive experienced the same thing in the past once.
Yep not always a terrible time to eat out at least.
How did they do?
How olds your child?
Just barely older than my son. I can definitely understand that.
what happened why were their so many dead fish?
I hope they are not using the lake for drinking water .
Good luck! Im sure it will be fine.
Youre too hard on yourself. Everyone messes up sometimes even the greats.
Yikes thats no good. How many stitches did you have to get?
What happened to the dog afterwards?
Thats quite the win! What was the bet?
Oh! Gotcha! Ive never played the switch but I heard its an exciting console!
Oh cool where does your friend live? Is it an exciting location?
Oh man dont bail on your trip. Try and get those thing that came taken care of this week. You dont want to disappoint her.
Oh no I bet your parents were freaking out.
Oh that sucks getting blamed for it when it was their fault.
Do you get much use out of it or is it just collection dust?
I guess you can hang on to it or maybe theres someone else you both know who can show it some proper lovin.
well dang! that is very impressive! 
Understandable i bet the had good budgeting skills and a nice job.
Oh no!! That is terrible do you know what happened? 
Oh no I am sure they meant no harm they always say that they are more curious when they are young. 
It will pass in time even though it feels awful right now.
Aw Im sorry. I remember feeling like that and it was horrible.
Oh thats great! 9 years together is a long time. You sound happy Im glad.
What did yall do? Did you do anything special that evening? 
Oh I know exactly what you mean. Its not the same as going as a kid.
Yeah its no wonder these animals go crazy on humans sometimes.
Wow! what did you write about?
Nice well I hope you have a nice trip!
Congrats! Thats exciting. Is the new place far from your current home?
Wow thats really big! I hope you have a stress free move. I know it can be a little stressful but you seem very excited!

Hahaha that is so cute I am sure he loved that you teased him like that! I bet your classmates also had a good laugh! 
Wow! What field are you going to be working in?
Dang! I hope you make lots of money!
Wow! Congrats to her and I am sorry that you didnt get the prize. What did she win? 
Wow that is a great prize! Is she able to take anyone with her or is it just a ticket for one person? 
Wow were you at a festival?
I have seen that before. I have no idea how they can do that.
o That sounds exciting. Moving or spring cleaning?
Ya last time I moved I was packing for about 6 months. Its smarter to do it a little at a time and get things purged and organized. 
Oh no that is terrible I can not believe that they would drive off without leaving any contact information! How bad was the accident? 
Wow that is terrible. I hope that you are able to catch them or find surveillance videos of who did it because most malls do have cameras in the parking lots.
Aww were you excited when you picked her up?
I bet! What kind of dog is she?
Uh oh be careful about that you dont want him becoming dependent on you for handouts. 
Well thats good. I hope it works out for both of you maybe you could give him some budgeting tips. 
Oh my god you should have reported her.
I am really appalled at people these days.
Me too. Well I hope it is to somewhere that you like.
Im sorry to hear that.  Hopefully something similar comes along sooner than later.
Just remember to keep your head up and dont give up!
I do hope they stopped the car at least ! That sounds disgusting but its better than throwing up in the car right ?
I can imagine when something unexpected like that happens. I do hope they are ok now  Sorry you had to witness that !
New adventures! I want to go west.
I bet you are nervous.
Oh no. I bet they are going to charge you for a new one.
Maybe they will understand.
Aww. I had to put mine down last month. I miss her.

You gotta stick with what you know sometimes.
Thats right. Theres so sense in deviating. 
I feel you there I have a ton of stuff to do but I cant get any of it done in this rain. 
I really hope so I am not sure how much longer I can let my yard grow before it gets too wild. 
oh I am so sorry. That must be fresh on your heart may he rest in peace.
I can only imagine. I am so sorry. What was his name?
That is great to be prepared. Where do you live?
Oh yeah you definitely need to be prepared. Do you think you will get a hurricane?
Wow see enjoyment.
You are so lucky. Some men pray for that kind of wife
What kind of illness occurs if food is cross contaminated? Im so sorry this happens to you.

THank goodness you had extra supplies on hand.   My son was the hardest one out of my 3 kids to potty train.   I feel your pain!!
Oh did you give it to him yet?
Thats so cool. Im sure he will love it! Where did you get it?
I love vacations I hope you and him have a good time.
What cruise line are you using did they give you a good discount.
Oh my goodness! What happened?
Oh I know what you mean. I have felt that way. Best thing to do is pray about it and dont be hard on yourself.
Thats amazing! Im so happy your prayers were answered. God knows your heart.
Ive never done that but i know plenty of people who do that. Its normal every know and again but dont turn it into a daily habit!
Damn that sounds good honestly its fine every know and again. we all have a sweet tooth.
Aw yay!  How old is he?
I love that age!  My niece just turned six and she seems so grown up!
Oh thats awesome im sure you were excited to help

Id have been nervous too.  When will you find out?
Oh I would love time away like that! How did you enjoy it?
That sounds wonderful! My body is craving something like this. Thanks for the inspiration!
Oh no did they do something embarrasing?
Thats absolutely disgusting!
Did the two of you have fun?
Thats awesome. My son has a skateboard but can barely stand up on it.
I am sorry that you are out of work.  Have you had any job interviews? It is good that your father is able to help you during this time.
Well I am glad you will hopefully get some disability income.  It sounds like your dad isnt the type who expects to be repayed.  He sounds like a great parent.
Did everything work out ok? How did you like them?
Oh me too. I dont even like to sit in the waiting room.
Interesting are you feeling OK having less bonding time?
I see I imagine time will start to fly once you take up a new hobby or school ends for the day.
Thats not very fun. I hate traveling like that.
At least you got to see your family for a little bit.
Ew thats always the worst. What were you getting?
Thats always the case! So annoying. I love the self checkout options. I wish more places had that.
Oh no! I am sorry to hear of your loss. Are you taking it ok?
Yeah funerals are really sad but they can make one appreciate life so much more.
Wow id be jealous
Same. I have a chance in a few years to go with the family but not 100.
I bet it is! I love getting together with friends especially if it has been a while...which it seems to be the older I get.
I bet it would be tough.  Was there a special occasion that brought you all together?
Thats so awesome! I hope you all had a ton of fun!
Hahaha yes we women dont want to get the men angry. But clothes are so expensive these days. We just want to look good for our men.
 I guess you can just tell her like you told me just now. Maybe she wont be afraid to tell you next time....... well maybe lol.
Yikes that doesnt happen too often in todays culture.  Did you say anything?
That might be for the best.  Were they arguing about her color or something else?
Thats really annoying. It would be great if people would just let other people be.
Im sorry you dont get to see her much. I dont see mine often either. Im sure it did make you sad.
Yeah I understand that. I live about 45 minutes from mine and everyone is so busy all the time. Maybe you will be able to see her soon.
Great! Are you home all day or do you just get them off to school and then head to work yourself?
For sure! I bet it was nice to have the hosue a little more quiet too.
Oh that must have been torture! Is everything alright?
I can imagine. Glad you are ok though! 
Oh no! thats no bueno. Usually the person that wants the least deserves the most. Thats sad
Oh thats awful and borderline abusive
ah you must have great memories than
you know todays events are tomorrows memories
Cool! What kind of fish do you expect to catch there?
Yum! Invite me over for some fish dinner sometime wont you?
That sounds like fun!  Is it with friends?
So cool I hope it goes well
That is so nice when family visits. It is so much fun! But yeah it is a lot of work for sure. 
Oh Happy early Birthday! What is it that you are hoping for?
Nice! I hope you get it! Cameras are such a wonderful tool to have these days and there are so many cool options to choose from.
oh jeez! what a mess.
I like dogs but thats why i dont have one lol
Excellent! Stay hydrated!
Sounds like fun!
Wow that sounds quite disturbing. Was someone breaking in?
Im glad everything turned out okay!
Yeah flooding is a real problems these days. The weather is crazy! Hopefully you and your house will stay nice and dry.
I would be scared too. I hope everything will be ok for you. Fingers crossed.
you sort of gamble on store bought cakes did you take it back?
you are a lot bravery than I I dot think i could it eat
Do you feel any less nervous?  Job interviews are always nervewracking 
Either way as long as you feel a little bit better it was worth it.  Im sure youll do great!
Oh yeah! I love chocolate anything! But grandmas cooking is always the best of all!
Not me! haha I love them all!
that must be a cute picture
so young and ready to conquer the world
What video games are the two of you playing?
Its always amazing how quickly kids pick up on new skills.
You must really love that dip to have that much of a reaction to the loss of it.
I would assume so since there has to be someone out there who robbed you of your oniony gold!
Congrats! is it a good promotion?
Wow that is super exciting. Not many people get that opportunity. You must have worked hard 
Wow thats really exciting! Good for you you must be nervous. 
Thats great what kind of work are you in?
Well I really hope you get it. Youre right you did what you could. 
Thats horrible news!  I dont understand how people can be so cruel sometimes.
I know in some places the penalty for hurting an animal can be tougher than that for hurting your kids.  Nothing makes sense sometimes. 
Was that a good day for you?
Thats amazing! Sounds like a beauty day! Are you English?
Oh but I bet you appreciated it! Summer can get long. 
Oh that does sound like a fun summer. I read recently that we only get 18 summers with our kids make them count. 
Its good to stop and appreciate teh moment sometimes. 
Oh no I can imagine so! Was it gunky?
Oh goodness glad you got through is safe lol
Oh thats not right. I have a rescue dog she had a litter of puppies at a puppy mill before she was a year. 
I could chat with you all day! We have a lot in common I feel the same way. Keep chatting? Poor rescue animals. 
Thats great! So sad for those poor animals. 
They should they say people who hurt animals will hurt people too. 
That sounds awesome Im glad he did well. 
I hope he gets the team he wants. 
You must be relieved! You excited for free time?
That sounds seriously like a dream. I cannot wait until mine are old enough to start school.
4 and 1. I have a bit to go haha.
Awww that will be a boring week. Sorry to hear that. Maybe youll be productive!
I hope it flies by! 
Was the owner not around? Did the dog cause any harm?
Sounds scary! Dogs are very loyal creatures but can cause a lot of harm
That is very heartbreaking. How did you find the kitten?
Very sad to hear. You have a good heart and are very caring that is something to atleast be proud of!
Kids pick those things up quickly.  And itll help with her handeye coordination reading  all sorts of things!  
Yeah.  Back when the only buttons on a controller were Start Select A and B!
Oh no! Hopefully you are able to get it sorted out. Its hard to keep up with all the fees for kids schooling.
Sounds like a headache i know the feeling. I got a letter saying i had a few days to purchase a purple shirt from my daughters school. Good luck!
That would be rough.  Hopefully youre in a better spot now!  Thats awesome you had family to help you out too!
I bet they do! I mean they do go to school for a while and study hard plus the schools arent cheap but they still dont have to charge as much as they do!
i would love some quiet time to myself consider yourself lucky!
i have a husband and three kids its always loud in my house
Oh no! How did you guys get caught?
I bet did you both get in a lot of trouble?
What movie was it?  Is it currently in theaters?
Thats too bad! I was hoping that one was going to be good!
Oh my gosh! I would be furious as well. 
I am sorry that happened. Dont do him any favors.
Yeah you need peace and quiet to be able to work.
My son keeps trying to show me Youtube videos so I completely understand
That is normal that just means that the other person is special 
Well i will keep my finger crossed for you!
Yeah i can imagine but a little worm wont hurt ya
I understand but atleast it was not poisonous 
I live in bear country.
I bet I would have been scared
Awwww. that is so sweet! Details. Boy girl breed. 
Awwwww. He sounds super cute! Have lots of fun with him. 
oopsy. I hope it was worth it. 
LOL! Can  you run out and get another pie before she gets home?
That sounds terrifying so glad you did not step on it
I can imagine I would have nightmares about that 
And be watchful when you do!
Congratulations. Thats always a plus.
If the movie is worth it you will never miss them.
I understand. Its tough these days.
I love butterflies because of the colors. What color was the butterfly?
Yellow butterflies are beautiful. Photography can capture some great images a lot of times.
Oh my dog did that too! I dont know how they think its a tasty morsel...so gross!!
I was just going to say the same thing! Im like Stay away! 
I love cats.
I agree absolutely
Congratulations. I hope you get it?
Just relax. If its meant to be it will be.
That must have been scary..
How long did he think he had won?
That was funny I bet.
Oh wow did you give him the money?
That would be so scary I am glad you are safe!
Im so sorry to hear that. How long had your cat been with you?
Its always hard to go through that. Thats why Im wary of having any pets
Does he like to sing?
I bet he sings in the shower everyday.
You must have worked hard for that! Im sure its great and youll pass with a flying color!
Yeah such a relief to get a huge project done. You must feel proud!
That must be really irritating. Is she doing it deliberately?
Haha  maybe youll learn to love it! There must be something good about it if your sister has any taste.
Ive never been abroad before but Im going to spend two weeks in France next month!
I am going to visit a few cities and tourist attractions.
Oh no did they get angry? 
Okay I am glad that they were not angry. and I am sure they knew it was unintentional so dont feel too guilty about it.  
Wow you are very trusting I do not think I would allow a friend to borrow my car. Is it legal for him to drive with just a permit? 
Oh okay I see I thought you actually lent him your car and let him drive around town with it by himself! 
Thats a big decision! What are your choices?
If you want my advice  choose something youre going to enjoy. I personally couldnt be a nurse  too messy!
I hoep you reach your goal. It must be tiring.
Dont give up. Things may not be great one day but they always pick up eventually.
that stinks were you guys going school clothes shopping?
Thats good school shopping is always stressful for me
okey no problem
For mine too. That was also i said.
I understand completely. One has to live within ones budget. It can be hard though.
Its only normal to want to live within ones means. Too bad you cant leave a tip every time.
Wow ! Thats quite unfortunate!
Well handle it wisely
It sounds like a stressful day. You have to just live in the present so you will not be too stress out.
When that is over then you can do you. We have to make time for ourselves.
Im very sorry for your loss. Thinking about and remember all of your good memories with her may help.
Thats a good way to remember her and keep her close to your heart.
Yes it does. 
That cant be easy. How old are your children? Sometimes I wish we could keep our kids small forever!
Yeah you want them to learn but its definitely hard to see them doing things that you might not agree with. 
Wow thats really scary! Labor is a really terrifying thing especially when something like that happens. Did everything turn out okay?
I can imagine. When I was in the hospital with my 3 year old they lost all his vitals as well. Kids like to keep us on our toes from the start!
What platform do you play it on? PC or PS4?
PC is the way to go for gaming. That sounds like an awesome type of game. Is it multiplayer?
Thats so cute. How old is she?
Oh mine. That is not cute.
Thats no good. Did you go to the doctor?
Got to make sure you take care of your self. Its scary when your heat sensitive.
It will be okay. We sometimes do things that we regret.
You have to forgive ourselves. We dont need others validation.
Will you be able to spend more time with her?
I can imagine but its good that her hard work is about to pay off.
Well I pray you get through it
How do you feel about that ?
Hopefully she re considers you should talk to her about it
That is risky what do you plan to do
Okey if she is no cause for alarm
Good. You sound confident. When is it?
Im sure youll do great then!
Oh how sweet high school days is always fun
Yes it does happen
am sorry to hear that may he rest in peace
I hope you getting better now
Oh no! Im sorry. Is she going to be ok?
Oh man. Dont feel guilty accidents happen. Hopefully she recovers quickly.
Thats great what is your favorite meal?
That sounds so good i love steaks
It can been nervewracking to start a new job. But Im sure you did well right?
Its wise to be careful but suspecting people all the time may not be healthy. You need to build a good relationship with your new coworkers.
I know exactly how you feel. I have a crazy addiction to soda.  I dont think I can quit!
Maybe try to slowly quit? Like just drink one less a day
Oh the wait is terrible.  What type of job?
Oh no! That is not good! Hopefully you were able to get them out. 
LOL! Im sure. Dont be too rough on them.
Why couldnt you sleep?
I hope so! Why are you stressed?
Oh that sounds uncomfortable. How did you play it?
I respect that I think it shows character and honor. Im hoping something rewarding comes your way.
Oh geez thats not good.  Was he bothering anyone?
I dont blame you.  I probably would have done the same thing.
I remember that feeling with my daughter it is indescribable.
There is nothing to compare it to. I wish I hadnt been waking from anesthesia in that moment so I could have been more awake. 
Oh no! It happens to the best of us  Have you talked to her about it when you remembered?
Awww Im sure she completely understood and really appreciated you reaching out and going to visit her!
Oh how cool! Dd you and your dad play together?
Thats great. Itll be wonderful to relive those happy moments in the present maybe with your family.
Wow that is scary. Were you nervous?
It sounds like a great experience!
How did you feel when he gave it away? 
Yeah I would have been too. As a nine year old kid thats hard to deal with. 
Ouch! Was it a serious fall?
Thats a relatively quick recovery fortunately. 
Oh my.. that must have been very sad. I cant even imagine how you must have felt. 
Im so sorry.! But Im really glad youve got those pleasant memories and the memento to hold on to so you can remember her fondly. 
Wow thats great you must have put a lot of work into your yard.
Cool I guess the grass is actually greener in your yard now!
Ooh nice. That does sound like alot of fun. Do you guys play any sport while your there? 
Cool. Well enjoy I hope the weather hold up.
Yeah I havent seen my friends in forever. We dont even live in the same state anymore.
I understand that feeling. Ive had trouble letting go of those kind of cravings too. Has your diet been going well otherwise?
Wow congratulations! Sugar is one of the hardest things to kick I dont have the knack for it either but still youre making great progress!
Oh no!  It always seems like things get lost when you move doesnt it?  Is there anyway you can go back and see if its at your old place?
It will probably be where you least expect it!
Oh wow.  How did she do?
Thats awesome!  Thats great exercise! 
Oh no! Thats so terrible!
Im so sorry that happened! Im glad shes okay though.
That is a great sister. Im sorry you were feeling down
I am glad you are feeling better now
That mustve been scary! Did you freak out?
Oh no. Im sorry to hear that. At least you both survived the flight. 
Oh I bet you were pretty upset. Did you guys reschedule?
Haha good! Im glad that one went well.
Its always nice to visit home. Did your parents enjoy your visit?
Ha ha! I bet. Dogs are the best. I bet he missed you just as much as they did.
What makes you want to get softer wheels? Are those harder to skateboard on?
I didnt know that about softer wheels! Maybe in the future you can change to those.
Oh neat!  How did the little one handle it?
Oh no!  Poor baby must have been really stressed out. 
Oh no!  Hopefully its just the flu.  What did they say?
Thats good!  I hope she gets to feeling better soon.  The flu is no fun.
Congratulations! I bet she is excited and hopefully you are excited for her. 
Oooo!!! That is so awesome! Will you be in her wedding party?
I love kitten but I cant have one where I live. I bet it is so cute
Do you plan on getting one
oh man. i hate that. weve had some pretty nasty storms come through Austin in the last few months and luckily ive managed to be in some random parking garage out shopping or eating when theyve rolled through.
lol. well thats no good. cleaning garages bites. 
i guess in your field of work you would run across terms and methods which are unfamiliar
youll find some like that not much you can do
How long did it take you to get your promotion?
I bet that your bosses will give you the long over promotion. I will keep my fingers crossed for you. Good luck!
Thats wonderful! Do you have a charity in mind yet?
I bet it will feel amazing to have them cheering you on! I have a feeling youll do great in your race.
Thats wonderful! Where are you guys going to go?
Im glad you guys had a good time. Are you planning another trip?
Where is it that you go to go home? 
Thats awesome. I love going back to my hometown to visit as well. Its nice to see family you dont see every day.
wow. like very first? or just the start of the year?
how did he like it? how did you do?
Oh boy!!   WHat is the test over?    
Japanese language seems like it would be heard to learn.  Good luck on your test Im sure you will do fine.
great i hope you get the job.
so you were really prepared. 
Thats cool good movies have a way of tapping into those feelings.
Sometimes it almost makes me want to go back somehow. But its also important to move forward.
oh that is so wrong. How are you handling it?
thats good you do that I would be very frustrated too. Thats really unfair. Can you pursue legal charges?
Oh I bet that was fun. What kind of dog do you have?
My husband was gone all weekend buying us a new puppy so I understand feeling lonely! 
Ugh I bet that is really frustrating. Is it making it difficult to do your job?
That makes for long days at work. I hope they can fix it for you soon.
Omg I bet they come home so spoiled.
Yeah what the heck I dont remember my mom being so nice when I was a kid! lol
Thats sad to hear. Whats his prognosis?
Hopefully medical technology will catch up to where it needs to be for him. 
Oh no! I used to be a financial advisor so Im sure that was frustrating. I hope you didnt lose too much money!
As much as I hate they didnt go up in price for you Im so happy that you didnt overdo it.
Oh yuck! Im sorry that that happened. What kind of dog is he? Is he sick?
Hopefully it was just a bad day for him and he wont do it again! I have a couple rescue mutts as well. 
Thats great! Do you get a chance to learn new languages often?
My ex programs for insurance companies and they all use the same ancient language for their statistics. She hasnt had to learn anything new for decades.
holy moly thats great i cant ever walk normal
That is wonderful! So you will be on a vacation? Will you be going alone? 
You will be having fun in the sun. Nothing like a day at beach.
Yea once I vacationed on a Caribbean island Lovely beaches food and drinks.
Oh man! how long did it take to get your stuff back?
Oh wow that can sure put a damper on things.
oh wow thats fancy
i bet a shocker indeed i like apples
Nice! What did you guys get to eat?
Thats good that it was a profitable  conversation! Do you guys talk often?
Ooh very nice suprize!
Keep up the good work whatever your doing.
Oh dear. I am so sorry to hear. It is possible for you to get a second job?
i can just imagine. I wish There was something that I could do to help.
I pray and hope that something works out and that the good old faithful car will not bite the dust.
That is always a fun thing to do! I hope the memories were all good!
Thats awesome! Did you show them to your sister after you found them?
Oh no! What happened to your laptop? if you get a new one which one are you looking at?
Ouch What a pain that is! I can imagine i would be the exact same in that situation.
Oh man that sucks. Im so sorry because you could have slept in lol
See theres always a bright side. You got a surprise day off from work!!!
Thats awesome. Days off are the best!!
hey thats cool its a new opportunity what are you gonna do?
hey thats really good Im proud of you!!!!
That sounds like fun! My son does basketball. I bet he looks tough in his helmet and football gear. 
Thats awesome!  Have you been scheduled for an interview yet?
I would be too!  I hope everything goes well with it!
Thats excellent! Is it a done deal yet?
Cool! Good luck and think positive. 
Oh no. Poor baby mustve been embarrassed. Did he cheer up?
That was really sweet of them. Glad he got a treat to cheer him up.
Ive done one of those before. They are pretty cool. Do you think you will get the job?
Im sorry to hear that. Ill pray for you if thats okay and  then maybe you will get it but if not maybe something even better will come along.
Great. And youre very welcome. I enjoy praying for other people.
Sorry to hear that. There are no alternatives? 
I can relate. I dont have healthcare at the moment.
Yay!! That is great news! He must be so happy he made it!
Wow! What a great team to be on!
That is amazing. She is a very smart girl.
You must be proud of her. That is a lucky dog a bark for each count. Haha.
Indeed you are I am proud of her as well.
Oh god I miss my dreamcast I bet you were so happy when you got it.
Thats great I have pretty much all of the ones I had in my childhood even the Atari.
Anything you need!! Im here for you!
Dont sweat it it happened to me in my mid 20s also. Couldnt even tell ya how or why just that it did.
LOL I dont think so. I think youll be fine maybe you were just extra tired.
Lol! I dont think i would trust that concoction if i were you.
Well then. Kudos to uncle Jeb!
I am so sorry to hear. I have a cat that I love very much. How is the cat doing now?
I am glad that she is much better.
that is very scary how did you get home
that is dangerous glad that both of your are okay
Okay well if you have it then you would have to see a doctor.
Now that is interesting I wish you the best of luck.
Oh really? Are you afraid of missing out on something?
Well it is good to have extra food on hand these days. You never know what major event can happen.
Oh my! Is she ok and was it while surfing?
Did you recover the leg? And I once almost got my finger bit off by a snapping turtle it wasnt a pleasant experience so I couldnt imagine hers. You are great for staying there.
How could you? Oh dear now you would have to apologise
I am glad that you were able to reschedule
I am sure that was an interesting conversation.  What did your friend think?
Lol   I think that even the people who like him would agree with that
That must have really been a wonderful surprise!
Yeah childhood ends way too fast its great when we have a chance to reflect on them.
Nice the windy city! Had you been before?
Ive never been but would love to go one day! Ah no what was wrong?
Aww that is nice. Where did you study abroad?
Wow how exciting! I also traveled Europe and Italy many years ago. I loved it!! Wish I could just move there. 
Wow thats incredible. What was her anme?
Haha thats really funny. I bet she was a special person.
I am too! What are your plans?
Ive been to Universal and everything else around there but sadly never during halloween Ive always wanted to.
Thats rare these days I was with mine for 7
I hope you at least got a severance package!
Was it a bad one? And did she find out?
Sometimes the lies get so heavy you just crack. Good for you though.
I know how hard that can be. Is it working out?
It does take a lot of stress off of you.
I hope you are ok what happened?
I can believe so  Hope you get justice and a paycheck!
Thats always fun! Did you get anything cool?
YAY! I think shoes are a great gift.
Nice how did it go? Was the guy nice?
Thats great! Did you get the job?
That sucks. Do you know what caused the outage?
You dont realize how dependent we are on electricity until the lights go out.
Oh nice! That seems more likely than winning the state lottery. That would be so cool if you won!
That sounds like a really nice program. Where can I buy some tickets?!
Were they a close friend? And did you pay them with pizza?
I had a shoulder injury when i last moved except I had to pay movers and pretend they were my friends for a day.
Sorry to hear that. What would you do if you won it?
It is good to dream. Dreams can come true. 
Oh  was it good? Ive considered it.
Only if you are choosing that over real tangible moments with friends or outside people.
That would take a miracle  or have some major money backing it.
Take some small steps and vote in other things for people with the right values not just pandering to the ignorant.
Im sorry to hear that how long did you have him?
Yeah that is a long time for a fish do you have plans to get another one
I hate when that happens They expect us to be on point every time yet they cant bother. I usually decline anything after.
oh no! Did you lose a lot of work?
I can relate. I have lost whole essays for the same reason. I had to call in sick for school because of it.
im a browns fan i feel that pain
yea me too it sucks
You should probably go to the doctor about that
You could have a tear on your eye. You really should get it checked out 
I bet that was fun who did you go see?
Magic is such a cool thing. That suspension of belief.
oh thats wonderful! Is it a job that you would enjoy?
thats great! I hope you do well and get the job. good luck!
That is good what are you going to do to celebrate
that is always good have one for me!
Aww that was sweet of her. Does she do that often for you?
Thats wonderful. Its nice to have someone in life who cares for your well being.
Oh wow. How far away did you move??
Awww! I know they miss you too. I hope youre finding some fun with living on your own too!
I feel you. Last week I spend 1000 dollars to fix my daughters teeth. Dentists ask a lot of money now a days.
Ohh well thats good for you. These kind people always help in difficult times.
sounds good so far
thats a great feeling
Ohh He is so hardworking. You are very lucky.
Ohh good for you. You two are made for each other!
oh thats great

I bet that gave you some good feeelings
Yeah I bet. but atleast you have the memorys
O no! Can you fix it?
Well it is not hard to build a mailbox im sure you can do it

That is awesome! I bet your happy about that
Oh my gosh! How many did you adopt?!
Oh I see! What a lovely surprise though. What did you do with her litter?
Yeah it is hard to leave our animals behind
That is nice of her!
Aww thats so cute! Did he enjoy it?
Poor guy was just nervous Im sure the more you take him the more he will venture away from you and have some fun!
Well hopefully he is understanding if he is anything like my brother nothing a cold 6 pack wont fix.
All is well that ends well especially with family they gotta give ya do overs.
That is a great idea! how is it so far?
Yeah you will improve yourself and feel good about it
Thats good did you have to wait there or were you able to go home?
Haha thats rare when it comes to mechanics.
im sorry thats awful. its a shame his parents arent being more supportive
im sure he appreciates having you around though
That was really nice of them. I bet youre appreciative.
Im sure youll do a favor for them in the future.
Yikes! That is terrible! What a awful thing to do! I am glad he finally got busted! Wow for years huh?
Yeah me either. Hopefully they regret what they did and are able to learn something from this.
I enjoyed highschool too.
College was pretty laid back for me I did a lot of online classes.
I am sorry for your loss. I hope you can find comfort during this difficult time.
You will and that is what gives us the strength to face tomorrow!
Happens to everybody. My girlfriend who is the smartest person I know has had to make 5 duplicates of her car keys because shes locked herself out so much. Shes so forgetful because shes so efficient and on top of everything else important that sometimes she misses the small things. Maybe thats true in your case too!
Ive heard some people place theirs in a bowl near the front door as soon as they come home or they stick it in the fridge with their lunch.. silly things to make sure they can keep it together.
Wow. That must be a very special friend. I net you were surprised.
Oh dear. Maybe he is a loner and doesnt like friends.
oh thats just a recipe for disaster 100 of the time.
mine has too. i think you did the right thing by not getting involved.
Hm who might that be? 
Thats neat. You must trust him a lot given his track record of making money!
Oh my goodness!  Thats amazing!  Congratulations! Was it your first gold medal race?
That is awesome! It is for running?
That sounds exciting and scary.  What was the surprise?
That is so awesome.  Did you have fun? and more important are you a pilot now?
Thats cool did it bring back some good memories? 
I love the 90s also best decade in my opinion!
Oh no did you get hurt?
Yikes Im sorry to hear that.  That sounds horrifying!
So what did you do?
Well I bet your friend had a good time with you being there. Sometimes we have to make sacrefices for those we care about.
Im sorry. My wife could sympathize with you since Im gone a lot on business as well. 
Im sorry you feel lonely.  My wife says she ofens feels the same way.  I know your husband misses you awfully while hes away.  I love having chats with my wife every day when Im gone.
Just be confident and you will do great!
You got this! 
Ah yeah moving can be hectic! Are you moving somewhere you want to be?
Thats a positive at least good luck on the move!
Oh no!!! Did you see what happened to the dog?!
Thats so sad! What on earth is a dog doing around a highway?! That just breaks my heart.. 
I can understand the anxiety. Its a whole new different experience for first timers!
Same thing happens to me. I sometimes faint at the sight of a needle! Its good that your experience went well! Now you wont be nervous anymore. 
Aww! That is so cute! Has he done something special this week that made him extra sweet?
That is so sweet of him. Its definitely the little things. 
Good! Whats been going on?
Woo! Congrats on that! Thats always a nice surprise. What do you do?
Yeah exactly!  Music is awesome.  
Yeah he sounds amazing.  Sorry for your loss friend 
Never too old or too manly to snuggle a stuffed animal. My mom said I used to carry this blanket with me when I was a toddler everywhere I went. I wish I still had it. If I did Id consider using it again or at the very least passing it down to my own kid. Whats the harm you know? If something gives you comfort and doesnt bother anyone else there should be no shame.
Well if I were you Id keep it up whether or not my spouse laughed at me or a new girlfriendboyfriend whatever. Its not childish to me. Life is stressful enough. Let us snuggle what we want.
Aw! Thats horrible Im sorry to hear that.
Thats so sad I dont even know what to say!
Oh no! That is really creepy why is he in your backyard?
Yeah thats illegal I think they need to at least knock or ring the door bell!
I am so sorry to hear that. It cant be easy for you and your family.
No doubt it will take time to process. I wish your family the best. Stay strong my friend.
What shows are your favorite? That must be nice.
Must be nice got any nice snacks?
Good choice. Youre health is more important than some grad degree. 
I think nowadays employers just want experience. So it should be easier once you have that. 
Ah I hate when that happens! How embarrassed were you?
Sorry to hear that. Hopefully youre not seriously hurt! 
Youre sweet what kind of soup did you make him?
I love chicken noodle he must be so grateful.
I bet that was a little embarrassing.
I am sure it was not as bad as you think. 
Wow! What kind of meeting is it?
Dang! I hope you have successful meeting then!
Oh no was it romantic texts?
Thats sad. I hope you are OK.
That must be weird to talk to your ex still.
You must have feelings for him that are lingering.
Nice! It feels good to be confident. When do they come out?
As you should. You must have good teachers too!
why? what happened to it? is it okay?
that sounds terrible i hope you didnt cry alot.
Oh yeah?  Do you know someone that lives there?
Yeah.  Thats awesome that you do that though.  Makes for some special moments with your daughter and teaches her stuff.
That sounds cool!  I bet she cooks good!
haha same here!  
I am so happy for you that you have someone you can trust so completely.
Hopefully she knows how much this means to you.
DID HE GET ACCEPTED? I HOPE SO
OMG thats amazing good on him! you must be so proud
oh wow how did your mother handle this how did you handle it . i can only imagine the pain.
that is really painful i hope everything becomes better soon.
where did he go study at? i can imagine how hard that could be. but its good to see him following his dreams
aerospace engineer that sounds very interesting. hopefully he will stay focused and reach his goals.

that sounds so cute
that is good news. its always good when what you learn helps you get ahead
i hope you do well and excell
An adult did this? 
I dont get people sometimes. Who does that that sort of thing.
Aww they grow up so fast!!  How did she do?
haha Im sorry you were so upset for nothing!  But its so great that she loves school.  I hope she loves learning her whole life.
That is all that matters its about the love.
I understand. Did you told your friend?
Wow it is terrible.
Did you go see who it was?
No thats scary stuff.
That is great. What is it fun?
That is always difficult.
I am single and never been married. I assume arguments are part of marriage.
Im bad at giving advice especially to people I dont know. Im the opposite. Im too mellow. And that sometimes gets me in trouble.
In some ways that is a bit funny but it certainly can be a scary time to come home alone to an empty dark house.
I hope you arent still scared of your shadow?
I dont think you should feel too bad about missing one day!  It sounds like youre generous regularly.  I get it though.
Its hard to see people and not be able to help.  You seem really giving!
Children are a beautiful thing for us parents. What a great memory you have of that. 
Thats perfect a boy and a girl thats what most people want. congrats. 
In what do you believe?
That is great. In what do your colleagues believe?
What car did you buy?
Jeez. Where do you live? I dont remember any state Ive been to with bad drivers.
Good luck! My sisterinlaw has been with weight watchers for a while now. She loves the camaraderie and how everyone encourages each other.
Youll reach your goal. You just have to make small adjustments whichll sustain you throughout your life. How many meetings do you attend?
That test seems so hard. I probably couldnt even pass it. How did you do?
I didnt know that. Congratulations. Thats so awesome.
That must have been nice. I keep cards too.
Of course not. There is so much paper in this house. I keep cards photos school projects. Everything. We arent here forever
I found lots of things to pass down when my grandmother passed. I think they passed down their hoarding to us lol
Lol. Me too!!
Why was it slippery
Oh no were you okay
Oh no. Why are you keeping the secret?
Oh it sounds like you are in a difficult situation. I hope you can get out of the middle of it!
Oh I am sorry. Did you get any part?
I am glad you got a good part. I am sure it is a let down to not get what you were hoping for though.
That is wonderful I imagine she is very excited.
Okay i see well take your time she will be getting her liscense soon
She just needs to get her confidence and I am sure you are a great teacher.
It will definitely paid off and I am rooting for her.
That can be overwhelming. Are you going to be cleaning all day then?
Im sure you will get it done!
Thats neat. Do you guys make a lot of money?
I wish my siblings were like that. We should be more supportive and close like that
I am jealous lol
I will work on it with my family. 
Wow!  It sounds like your kid is quite smart and gifted!  You must be really proud of him!
Man that is amazing that both your kids are so talented.  I hope my little ones are like that.  Congrats on your great parenting!
Are you able to learn the route first before you have to take it for your job or are they kind of just throwing you into it?
Well hopefully youre able to familiarize yourself quickly. Good luck!
Thats sad. Have you been to Scotand since?
Im sorry to hear that. Were you born there?
96! Wow. Thats a full life!
Wow. She probably couldve kept going for years if it wasnt for that.
Excellent! Are you enjoying it?
Sick. I hope its as fun as it looks!
I am glad that she is living close to you. That must make you feel special. My mom is dead so I understand how you feel.
I am happy that your mom is still around. Cherish the days that you spend together.
are they typically bad or something?
Oh that makes sense well enjoy the peace and quiet!
Thats awesome. What did you guys do?
that sounds fun!
Poor thing! What did you do?   Did you take it home with you?
eww  that is great you took such great care of him.  
That s nice of you.  Did you keep it as a pet
Cool.  Some birds shouldnt be in captivity.  What kind of bird was it
That is a nerveracking experience. But Im betting you did graduate and did just fine!
Congratulations! Waiting for results can be very stressful  everythings out of your hands and all you can do is wait.
Im sure she understands just tell the truth!
Yeah Id be pretty scared too but its better to be upfront about it to get it off your chest
Oh boy. Did you not get the memo that you were supposed to be wearing a dress?
Everyone looks good in a dress. Just make sure to shave first.
Oh man I did too.  I still do every once in a while but only when Im having trouble sleeping.  Does one stand out from the rest that you remember vividly?
Creepy! I once had a dream of a Lion laying at the end of my bad. It was scary but also comforting.  I feel like I couldve touched it. Glad youre free of those dreams now.
So you probably felt pretty guilty huh. Did you return what you stole?
Glad to hear you stopped with your wayward habits before the Po Po caught up with you!
Ive always liked the idea of meditation but I feel like itd be hard. My mind is always racing!
Awesome Ill check that out! I hear all sorts of great things about meditation.
Me too do you have any special plans?
How fun! yes I am sure they will have  a great time!
Is it for college?
Well good luck I hope you get in!
I love cooking! What types of things do you like to cook?
I am also a vegetarian and I love cooking Italian food.
Those are so much fun. Was everyone hype?
Tight. Probably wont be able to do that again!
Oh my gosh so tiny. Im hoping since he was released from the hospital he is doing well now?
I can imagine. Im glad to hear hes better! Life is such a gift.
That is really nice that you guys have that trust.
That is an awesome goal! Good luck!
I hope it didnt mess up your clothes. Im sure it was a mistake.
Im glad it didnt mess anything up and that your relationship with your sister is still in tact.
Oh no. I rent also so I know your pain. My last landlord was awful.  How did your landlord react?
Oh good glad he did that instead of just coming down on your for not paying.  Glad it worked out for you.
Lucky you did that in time!
Sounds like it worked out great for you!
Wow! You should do something back for her!
Nice I am jealous of your friendship!
Was it something important that you took ?
I see did they ever find out it was you ?
That is awful I am sorry to hear that.  Is he doing better now?
Im so glad he is better.  Is the whole family doing alright?  I know that can be really hard on people.
Life was easier back then Hopefully you still love life?
Nostalgia can stir emotions. Youll find something to love about life again.
Oh no!  What happened?  Did she just get loose?  
Thankfully they are both okay.  Dogs or cars or anything for that matter could get them!
That is embarrassing. I would hate to have that happen.
That is the best way to handle those situations.
Ouch! I can relate. What made you decide to drink a whole gallon in a day?
Haha! I hope you experience no seriously ill effects!
Sheesh that is brutal did you smack him?
I dont blame you that is low.
Me neither I hate it when they just wont leave you alone
Yes! I feel the same
Always try to brush your teeth at least twice a day it helps
If you dont take care of your teeth then you will have a bad time later in life
That is bizarre have you had this seen about?
That is odd are you afraid when you wake up?
You sound a lot like my husband. He is really into going to the gym. Life isnt right if he doesnt get gym time.
I agree. Its pretty cool to see the changes. I never really got into going to the gym though. 
I have been skydiving too! It was a fun experience.
I lost my hearing for a few hours after though but other than that it was a wonderful experience.
That is great did something recently happen?
Awesome! What type of music?
What possibilities do you speak of?
That sounds pretty exciting.
Ive never been much for meditating. Im glad you enjoy it.
What got you into meditation?
I think thats a good idea so you arent always dependent on others to have fun and just enjoy time to yourself.
Meditation on goals and positive ideas during some of that alone time can be so uplifting and refocuses you.
I used to struggle with the same problem it can be overwhelming
Grats.  How long have you been working out for?
Keep your diet clean and youll keep improving.
That sounds nice. Hopefully it isnt too hot for you.
Are you going to be sleeping in a tent?
Thats just so sad. House fires are terrifying to me.
The wiring was probably old and not up to code anymore.
did it go flat?
that is very fortunate!
That is really nice of you!  Is the cat OK now?
Thats good.  If not for you who knows what could have happened.  You must be a very caring individual.
I think that is a lovely thing
If its important you will figure it out
Yea its a good idea to take time for yourself when you can
I think relaxing is very important
Yeah as a child its hard to see other kids with a bunch of friends when you dont have that many.
Well I hope you got over that issue and ended up making lots of friends yourself.
Oh man! thats impressive those baths are rough.
Thats good. But still! You must be pretty tough!
Are you taking protein?
That is good hopefully it helps!
I agree were you recently screwed by one?
Yep its disgusting
That is sweet of you kids are cute
Oh that is not good I hope you were able to clean it up easily...
Wow I havent thought of them in years.  Sometimes it is good to have bands you can always go back to
True.  I have favorite bands to that I consider to be musical comfort food
Nice! Are you getting a car soon too?
Definitely especially when you get really hungry at night. I love a good drive thru
That is awful. Ive had it happen to me once before.
I sure hope so too! It is a lot of work to get it sorted out. 
Yeah... that seems like a hard gig especially in todays day and age where everyones so wary and especially since theres not often people at home during the day. You have to have good people skills to do that job though. So you at least probably have that going for you.
Ah.. yeah Im sorry you had to run into that kind of problem. Its hard doing a job you dont agree with the ethics of. Theres really no way to fake it sometimes. But at least you were able to realize that and stand by your morals.
Is he going out drinking?
That is such a tough time my son is teething as well
Well I am not a religious person but I will have to say it urks me when I am surronded my religious people that is trying to push their belief on me. Then seeing them feel people heads with stuff that they can not prove is there irritates me also
Lol. exactly how I feel
Oh thats not unusual. You must try to relax. Is it an important presentation?
I see I hope it goes well for you. Remember to breathe! 
That is a scary situation. People do not care anymore.
You are so right! 
That is awesome what degree are you working towards?
I can imagine waiting sucks!
Thats kind of odd. I probably would have tried to take a swing just out of pure instinct. What was the reason they wanted to wake you up?
Hahaha.. thats kind of goofy in a way. Yeah sometimes nothing good can come of people trying to get your attention randomly in the middle of the night. Thats probably the wisest choice. I probably wouldnt be able to act that good enough to pull it off.
Ouch!  What did you take?
Was it an awesome keyboard worth getting in trouble for?
Congrats! Thats so exciting do You fel ok?
YAY! good job! Heshe is going to be beautiful
I still think it is i always get so excited
yep thats one of the things that make it so nice
Oh wow that is weird. Did you say anything to him?
Yeesh how awkward is that.
Were you able to take the plate id?
I understand. Sorry to hear about that.
Oh nice. What kind of candy was it?
Oh yeah I think I have tried that one! I love anything by Haribro! 
Glad to hear it. I hate hearing about children having tragic childhoods and not being able to just simply be a kid. But at least shell have a good perspective and appreciate life more.
Even if she does it will help make her a wellrounded relatable person. Usually these things help ground kids and give them character. But maybe youre right if she moves on from it quickly thats great too!
What had he made in the world?
Thats super cool I played a few years back but eventually quit.
I am really sorry to hear that.  I hope everything is alright.
Well that is just terrible.  I hate it when companies jerk you around like that.  I hope you will be able to reschedule it although I know that wouldnt make up for the frustration.
that is a great way to look at it
Yeah more people should look at life like you do
did you call the exterminator?
I live in Texas to so i know those feels
What is the test on?
Chemistry is quite difficulthave you studied hard?
Are you fine now?
Cool  Is your car damaged a lot?
Thats funny hope he didnt give you a heart attack.
I would probably scream also.
Wow! That sounds amazing. Where are you going? 
You are going to love it I am sure. Safe Travels! 
Thats horrible hope he is ok.
I see glad he is ok.
Hi how are you?
That was kind of you I am sure they appreciated that!
My last vacation went horribly wrongQ!
Yes I love to reminice
Im sorry to hear that. I have never had a dog. What was your experience of the dog?
I am really sorry to hear that. What was the dogs name?
Hello How are you and what is your story chat about today? 
OMG wow.... i hope you got it open quick! 
Hi a few months ago my mother found some stray dogs that were starving so she told us about them. Of course we brought the poor babies to our house a mother dog and her two puppies. My heart went out to them as their ribs were showing but they were still so loving and sweet.
Yes I really felt so much sympathy for them and we all really liked them. We already had several pets so I wasnt going to keep them but I wanted to help them get better and find them a good home. We did for all of them with the puppies being able to stay together.
That is really nice to see... I bet it made you feel good! So sweet. 
Nice to still see that behavior in todays world. 
Thats sweet that you remember that how old were you? 
I wont make you reveal your age! lol p 
Thats wonderful. How long have you guys been dating?
Time flies by pretty fast. Could be together 10 years from now!
congratualtions. what do you do?
oh wow. were practically neighbors.
How big was the deck?
Wow that is big.
What is scary about what she is doing? Im not quite understanding what you mean.
Oh wow I can see why youre worrying. You should really talk to her about all this if she comes around soon.
Thats great. Did you create the script?
I love google. It is my favorite search engine.
Thats wonderful news! Its such a nasty disease! How long has he been clear? 
Well I hope he has 100 more years to go!  
Have you tried to call her?
Maybe give her space.
What birthstone is it.
What birthstone is it?
I love to play Madden.
Yes every day.
Where is she?
Just give her space.
Did you teach her?
Did you stay and ride it out? I bet it was quite a thing to see!
That must be so much fun. I have never surfed but love to be on a boat. 
Wow I hope I am fit enough at 70 to surf!
Wow 4 children my first is on the way and Im freaking out. You must have great friends.  
Thank You. That is our next step we are moving from NYC to Miami after the baby. How can we find friends like yours? 
I see what you mean about a parents group. I joined a dads group in facebook and its full of people who complain non stop about  being an adult. 
That sounds fun I was never any good at painting
That probably helps a good deal!
I wish I had a rubber bumper to ram those people with!
That is terrible he could have hurt the horse!
Nice congratulations. How are you liking the new job itself?
Awesome I hope the job goes great for you!
Thats sad hopefully the new cat got to live a long and full life with you
Haha thats crazy I hope they became best friends I love cats.
I can imagine! That extra set of hands  and a person you can trust  thats the best!
Does she live far away? It sounds like maybe visits arent too frequent.
An hour? Damn for somewhere as meh as Dennys that really isnt worth it.
I havent been there in so long for that exact reason.
Oh really? What happened that made you look bad?
Oof yea that seems like it might take a few years or 10 before you can laugh at it but at least its over.
Thats awesome! My experience was quite opposite as I sat waiting in the dentist chair for a 2 12 hour procedure!
Yes! Im actually glad its over  So how long did it take you to fix the computer problem?
Yeah that is pretty annoying to have happen.
Good man! That is your money and they just wanna snatch from you.
It sounds like youre happy for her which is commendable given you didnt get hired. Were you very disappointed?
Thats always tough. Its so hard to tell what other factors come into play in situations like that. Are you happy where youre currently at or still looking?
Im so sorry about that. It sounds like youre doing your best to be supportive.
Shes very lucky to have you. I wish you guys the best!
I am very nostalgic too that must be a fun time!
That is true but it is part of life but it is cool to see things again regain perspective
Im sure it did! Its not easy to have to adapt to another persons habits.
Yes sometimes we have to learn to let go of the little things so we can appreciate the more important things. It sounds like you have done a great job!
I believe you are really sad although its a fact of life
True and the good thing is that when the kids grow they provide moral support to parents.
Maybe she did and remembered last minute. You should ask her!
Next year I would just forget her birthday all together!
Is he a stay at home father or does he just not want to work?
I am sorry to hear that. Maybe as he gets older he will get his priorities in order and see how hard you work.
Must of been pretty surprised Also great to have friends like that.
That must of just made everything even better!
That is a great news. You surely have done a great job.
You are very lucky
No I havent actually I recently just canceled my netflix service! I have been thinking about resubscribing though. 
I could not find the content that was best suited for me personally to consider it worthy at the time but if I do I will definitely check it out!
Was the color of red that different to show on the red carpet?
Oh! wow that must of been pretty obvious then.
Argh! Thats tough! Have you been able to come from a place of authentic apology? It can be easy to be defensive in those situations which of course only makes it worse!
Whats your approach? Does humor ever work....? You know like wearing a dunce cap while holding a huge bouquet of flowers? Or going John Cusack and holding a boombox overhead playing your song?
You should not be so insecure like that.
What is about them? Do you think he is better than you?
yes several times.The place is magical.
Well you are about to have the fun of your life but gamble responsible.
Why. Did you started dating recently or something
The most important thing is what you want.
Really?? are you famous then? What is your name?
Are you still competing on a professional level?
NOT THE TACOS!!!! Seriously I can understand how frustrating that is. Especially when you have the taste for something.....then gone!
Even worse. Im so sorry. What did you do instead?
Laughing and crying for you! Next time!
I wish I could emoticon this whole thing.....a string of crylaughing. I wish I could treat you to lunch there!
I have not! I used to run a lot for soccer practices. Have you?
Thats great for her. 
hahaha thats funny why are you still afraid of the dark?
OOO so you think something else is hiding in the dark and thats why your scared?
Thats probably the best thing to do before you go to work for a place. Were you happy with your results?
Sometimes its the extra step someone is willing to do that will make it. Good for you!
I feel the same way when Im away from my cat.  Does he have to travel a lot for work?
Maybe one day if you have the time you can pay him a surprise visit.
That is good. Where you running late
That sucks. I hate when I am running late I always feel behind
I dont think you should feel bad you didnt know!
Im sure he will be okay. Maybe you can make it up to him.
Sounds like a good idea.
Aw. Children will make us do things we NEVER thought we would or could do! 
That is SO exciting! Congratulations! You are a fabulous role model for your son.
Oh thats so sweet. My grandmother is a great person too and Im glad to know her.
I think its great that you have such positive memories of her that way shell always be there in some form.
Yes I love to visit the zoo!  
What were some of your favorite things to do back in highschool?
That is wonderful!. It is always nice to have at least one good parent.
My mom was pretty awesome too! Im glad you had a good one as well.
That is bad. Are you still afraid a lot?
You need to fight your fear
wow thats very sad!  I am really sorry!
Well I guess if that is something you enjoy.  I cant say that I have alot of friends.  Mostly my friends are family 
Yes I do actually I was almost in an accident because of rain at night once. 
Im glad you were okay and nothing bad happened. 
Oh that was so nice of them! I bet you were relieved!
I bet losing your phone causes all kinds of stress!
Okay thats good to know. Hopefully you pass the test and I hope you studied. 
Very nice man. Let me know your exam results when theyre released! 
Oh no! Ill bet that made you feel terrible!
I can see why not! Im so sorry that happened to you.
That is hilarious. I bet.
Oh my just the opposite LOL
Oh wow! Congratulations! That is wonderful.
I do not yet but hope to one day. I think you will be a great parent! 
wow yes it is 
He probably stored that up for his energy for the race
Haha oh wow how was that for them
Thats great im glad she did well
I hate it when that happens! were you ok?
I always wonder what goes through peoples heads when that happens.
That sounds nice! DId you have fun
Im glad you enjoyed yourself it is important to make time for family.
Im sorry to hear youre having to deal with that
Sounds like the best thing to do honestly
you will survive and you have something to look forward to
i hope your work day goes by fast
Oh wow that is so scary.  I cant believe he asked someone so young to do that.
I really hope you didnt have any lasting effects from the injury?
Wow! Im sorry to hear that. Do you think you will get an A this time?
Congratulations! Studying can be hard but sometimes its about technique rather than time spent. Are you doing anything different this time?
Oh no! Im so sorry! I hate when that happens!
Ugh! Thats the worst! Too bad you couldnt run home and change!
I hate snakes! They are like little evil creatures.
Dont even tlak about diets.I miss the times i was young and could eat all i wanted
Ugh.So boring.What wrong with being fat.At least they are all happy.
Yes I have an Associates in Nursing.
Yes its been a great career.  How exciting for you to be about yours.  Congratulations!
Holy smokes! Let me guess better for the environment?
You poor soul! Im all for saving the planet but you have to draw the line somewhere. I hope you get some relief!
But that is an awesome grade!  You should be so proud!!!
Oh its been years since Ive taken an exam!  Perhaps the last one was a parapro exam to help out in the local schools when my kids were younger  but they didnt even give me the grade  it was a passfail type exam the horror of not knowing the grade though!!
I love the Autobahn.
Yes I use to own an Audio.
I have never done that good job.
You should. When is the next one.
Oh wow thats cool.
Thats good you still think of him.
Thats cool. Was it hard?
Wow that is a lot.
What do you get from your mom?
I dont like uninvited guests either! So annoying!
I love dalmatians.
How old was she.
Well maybe it is but it could also just be shes spoiled.
Does she have like some other issues like mentally?
I have a pair of fuzzy slippers that make me feel pretty cozy and happy in.
That is the worse you finally find a brand and fit that perfect and they discontinue making them that is the worst happens to me all the time.
So did you end up finding a shoe that you could live with and that was close to the ones you had or have you been unsuccessful?
Wow did they notice?
They will forget about it soon.
I am so sorry to hear that. What did they do to make you feel uncomfortable going there?
Thats the worst! You think you can trust people and then they stab you in the back. I dont blame you for not wanting to see them again.
That is great. That should be good insurance. Are you generaly happy with it?
That is nice. Good luck with the sugery.
I love Colorado my favorite state.
I wish I could live there.
Did you fart?
Did they smell?
Thats good as long as no one got hurt.
No training at all!  Wow thats pretty impressive.  How far is a marathon?
Thats still pretty impressive.  I bet he was proud of himself also!  Does he plan to do it again and will you maybe do it with him?
WOW  he certainly is adventurous and determined.  I bet he will do amazing.
Wow you are brave.
I bet you drove fast.
Oh my! That sounds exciting for sure! I couldnt do it I dont think.
Have you ever done anything else so frightening?
I would say that youre an adventurous person. Me Im more laid back and mellow. Kudos to you and have fun!
At least you did it. Lance Armstrong did not learn until he was 13.
Love it took me 12 years with the same person to build up the courage to ask her to marry me. 
yes not if I can just calm the nerves for this skydiving trip.
Hope so. I dont do well with heights.
Oh I bet that was very stressful and difficult. I hope you did well on it?
Well at least you didnt go down in your grade. But it wasnt right to treat the students like that!
That is good how old are you?
I am 31 so same generation.
Oh gosh I am sorry. Did you let the pizza place know? 
Wow! In that instance I would prefer them to lie to me than to laugh and be like I knowingly fed you bad food. 
and did you knock it out of the park? 
Perhaps be less cocky next time? Either way Bs get degrees. 
Was he okay? Ive never heard of that going wrong.
Thats where you went wrong lol. Im glad he was fine. I wouldve been scared if it were one of my kids too. Surgery is still surgery.
Oh I bet that could be frightening for your dogs. Did you try to complain to them?
I think they have some leftover fireworks that they dont want to sit on. They should just use them next time.
it takes a strong and compassionate person to make that kind of decision.
She had a happy life. Im sure she understands.
Sounds nice. How long has it been since youve seen her?
Oh wow. That is a long time. Do you live far apart?
Thats awesome! What did they talk about?
Fascinating! What kind of work do you do?
Sounds like it was very exciting!
Me too! I also Iike staying home all day.
I have more time to watch movies and shows on netflix alot. I stay home with my little one year old during the day.
I hate when that happens!  I look forward to those all day you know!  Did you find out who the culprit was?
I think that calls for a nice steak dinner out  on his dime!
It happens to everyone are you out of it now?
Oh well it was nice to have someone to help you.
I dont like them at all. Ive seen too many videos on the internet where people get injured or they break easily
Yeah that is terrifying. The smaller country fairs are worse. I bet they have no one really checking up on them except the carney folk.
yeah and the people in charge dont get paid enough to always check up and repair them
I bet you were I did that to my husband when I was young. I thought it was the solution to relief from abuse.
I guess that was what you call a temporary situation. Sometimes moving on is required.
Dont you wish you knew you were living in the good ol days while your going through them
Probably the mid to late 90s. This is going to be hilarious but my one memory from that era is when I first heard Brittany Spears hit me baby one more time song. It changed my life
Sure I did! It takes determation to succeed
So if not by studying what else?
That must have hurt a lot.Did you go to the hospital? 
You are very accident prone.You should get an insurance right away.
That is so true. And sometimes that phone call can be a trip of a life time!
Oh my goodness! Once things settle down I will give you the info about our cruise. It will help you relax like it did me!
Sounds so exciting. What did he plan?
When and how? Are you flying or driving? Just because or is it your anniversary?
Thats too funny. You know Im the exact same way.. I get so nostalgic with my old things. Can never throw them away!
Yes someday... Haha. I love looking back at those kinds of things. It brings back so many good memories. Such a good feeling
Im sorry to hear that. Were you two very close?
Thats sweet I had the same experience with my own grandma too. God bless yall!
Wow that must have been challenging for everyone! Was he okay ultimately? Was someone able to help him?
That IS frightening! Hopefully nothing youll have to deal with again!
What was the initial talk?
So how do you feel when lonely?
Maybe she does not have the hots for you anymore.
yes i understood the first time.
I know the feeling. Once I fell in high school from a puddle and laughed it off even though I was hurt
Oh really? I havent seen that in an animal as of yet. Thats pretty interesting.
Oh dang talk about a fall! If I were your cat Id be embarrassed too! Lol
That is a hilarious intro thank you for that! So were you worried that your girlfriend found someone else humorous? And youre very insightful  intelligent if you say yes! Though being both of those things you have nothing to worry about 
These references are perfect. And your girlfriend must enjoy you very much. Mazel tov you crazy kids!
Is that good or bad? Why the concern?
OK why do you think so?
Indeed. It makes you feel good when you can help somebody else with their problem
I think if everybody in the world offered a hand of help to one another we would not have much problem
Well you should try to study more and see what happens
Well maybe you should talk about getting a tutor or somethinf
THAT IS TERRIFYING. Until the end of your story.. then I laughed so hard I cried. But that is so relatable. Ive been terrified of my own shadow more than once.
Thats hilarious But I also feel bad for you. Perhaps there is a way to calm yourself down after you watch a scary movie?
Haha hey I would sneak into my parents bed even as a teenager when I was scared especially during storms.
Im supposed to wait for you to start.  
You havent said anything yet other than asking why I hadnt responded. Sorry Im a little lost as to what I was supposed to respond to?
Really?  Where do you live at?
I feel your pain.  I live in Orlando Florida.  So Im in the same boat.
That is so annoying.Who he thinks he is???
I would be scared of a guy like that.
Aww... sorry to hear that. I havent personally seen the show. What hit you the most?
Sounds like a touching but sad story. Love without two ways interaction is really hard. I cant imagine myself going through relationship like this honestly..
You mean nostalgic?
What your grand father did to you was very special.
That is not very considerate or respectful plus the dog could get hurt if a vehicle were traveling down the street.
I live in the country so I do not have neighbors that live close. 
I sometimes get freaked out but getting freaked out every now and then is better than having to deal with neighbors. 
Yes. Peace is key.
Uhmmnn! Cut down on the intake 
You need to see a dentist then
Just all the time.Who does not?
It depends on the machine you are working on.
Do you have a tribal tattoo. How does it look like?
That was bad. You can try some tattoo removal tool
Did you know them well? You must be very trusting.
I think I would have just said I didnt have any cash and let that be the end of it.
Sorry! Try harder next time!
Never late you know!
That sucks. Are they mad or what?
Its kinda annoying to me when people dont call you back.
Serious? Why are you scared when you are in a wreck?
Wow you really have to be careful dear.
Yes I have it feels really bad when it happens.
Yea it can be quite embarrassing to look back on.
Come on you do not have to be jealous of your brother
You can learnt some skills from your brother. Maybe it will help
Are you trying to go out and meet some ladies 
That is the first step. What you have to do next is be at your best behavior always 
Do you work in the tech industry? You could always take a class.
Theres tons online and knowing more about computers can really help any profession.
I am sure it is something disgusting. Do you have someone do it around you
You can just let him know you are not comfortable with it
yes the patient is very ill
oh that is really a bad news i heared
What is it that you would like to share with me? I am very interested to hear about it!
Whoa I hope you win! You never know it could be your lucky day!
I know how you feel I get so scared when exams come up its so hard sometimes
Yea open book make you think you dont need to study but that isnt true at all
Cool I could not do English.
yea that does seem like a lot of work could you ever handle it?
ooo well that explains a lot. well hopefully he will pass some to you 
Which work are you talking about. it is always a good feeling to get things done. There a way your brain reward you with good feeling 
Oh yes i do most times. Who does not
I say think of all the places you always wanted to go and then choose a place you never even considered.
Yes deals will allow you to travel more for sure.
Do you think you can win the lottery 
Then why do you want to risk your money on such thing. Why not buy yourself a nice shoe instead 
I am very glad to hear that. Do you have any children?
I have no kids but would love to have some at some point!
i feel hopeful that i am going to recover from a mental dosirder
That sounds terrible. Why didnt he come?
Ah I see. I dont really talk to my brother much.
That seems pleasant. I am currently in my chair working!
I need some good rest myself. Sleep is so important!
Awesome!  Thats exciting.  What college are you applying at?
Thats awesome!  I wish you the best of luck in your future studies!
What is so interesting about the series
I see. Are you excited about seeing the movie
congratulations on getting your job we should go celebrate !
as long as the cake is funfetti i am more than there 
Wow are they going to pay for it?
You have some very nice parents when I graduated my parents said pay us more rent now. 
Thats a really good idea that sounds like it would be hard to sleep though
Im glad it turned out well or i hope so.
As it should.  However those things happen to everyone it is a part of life.
Hopefully something better happens when we die and our lives will go on in a better way.
Im glad you enjoyed it. Was it a wedding?
Thats wonderful. I am going to a wedding next week!
I understand. I remember when we had to save games to 5 inch floppy disks. They made really strange shuffling sounds and a lot of times didnt even read.
Yeah I had my Commodore 64 and Amiga in the late 80s. Still the games were great when they worked!
How wonderful. What sort of dog?
A fluffy white one? How amazing!
That sounds amazing! What do you think youre gonna do there?
Ive been one time but I was too young to drink or gamble so it was a little boring. That sounds like a great time though Im happy for you!
Thats unfortunate. Some people just cannot help but act rude.
Thats unfortunate. What do you think about Uber?
That is a tough thing to deal with but hopefully his first F will also be his last.
Fornite has surely caused many kids grades to drop.
That was so bad. What kill the diver 
It means he miscalculated the time he was to spend under the water. Sorry for him
Why did u leave your luggage for a stranger
Waoits a mistake
Thats intense. I hope you do as well as possible!
Keep up the great work. Pass that exam with flying colors.
Yeah sometimes I want to just stop going to work. I hate TPS reports so much!
Yeah Bill Lumbergh is the worst boss ever. He kept calling me every day when I just wanted to sleep instead of work!
i love cats just hold it between your arms it will be okay
thats better but sorry for the disappointment she had caused
wow that is amazing I went there back in 2000. You are in for a big treat. Make sure to get french bread.
Also the mcdonalds taste way better there than in the US if your looking for good cheap food. 
You need to be patient. Getting promoted at your work place takes patience and perseverance 
Your hopes are high. It means you have a good chance of getting it. And i hope you have the requirement too? 
Wow! It looks great that you feel achieved
Congrats Doctor!! your parents would have been proud of you
Sorry to hear that you did not get approved.
You are right about that. Owning a car can get expensive.
My dream car is a Chevy Camaro.
Classic 1975 would be great.
Do you still have them?
Do you own any other pets now?
Wow.  Did you get hurt?  Sounds scary.
I am always scared about those airbags!  I am so glad you are ok!
Oh my goodness thats horrible. Who was she?
Thats horrible I hope you are okay and are recovering from that.
Noi dont feel surprise d
Im glad too. What made it swell up anyway?
Oh I get that I had that happen near one of my wisdom teeth too.
Wow it was because you were young that is why
It is really nothing children behave like that sometimes
What did you pass?
Thats great! I bet you feel relieved.
i am so happy for you. I know how it feel when you are stranded 
You can collect her contact and make friend with her
I didnt understand you
That is bad. How could you forget?
I only have a couple really good friends who are always there for me. The rest of my friends dont really care about me that much.
Yeah we have to watch out for ourselves. At least we wont let us down lol.
Thats great news to hear. I hope things continue to stay great for you.
I agree. I think that difficult times are best navigated with a calm mind.
I hope it doesnt rain. Where are you going?
Thats great. I have been there before. It used to be a Spring Break hotspot.
Oh no! Thats not very nice but I guess you can play it off by just acting cool and laughing it off. 
Its okay its pretty funny and itll be forgotten about so quick anyhow. I know how it feels haha we all do.
Oh reallythats so brave of him
Okwhere did he travel to?
Yikes!  Schools get really mad about that as well as it makes the kid worry.
Dont beat yourself up.  It happens all the time.  I am sure you are a loving parent!
That is awful. Was anyone else hurt?
Were there any signs that the driver might have been impared as opposed to the breaks malfunctioning?
I hope the child recovers from her injuries.
Oh wow how did you feel about that? 
How fast were they going? 
Oh how nice how long are you staying?
That sounds exciting I hope you have a lot of fun!
Thats refreshing to hear Im happy for you. I rarely hear that people are satisfied with their partner.
Wow what really happened?
Oh really that was hectic for you I guess
You need to calm down and focus so that you can pass the exam
Do you get enough sleep. Being sleep deprived can make you lose focus 
what are you expecting? are you pregnant?
oh nice well happy birthday
Were you up when he got home?
I can understand your position. How old is he?
Is she a model?
Oh so what does a sitting entail?
Who are you talking about? What happened?
That is bad. I hope you see her in another event.
Yea I know that feel outside of a few people I knew nearly know one and avoided lots of people cause no one cared
It can be really frustrating seems like so many people have it good while so many have the short end of the stick
Yeahbut very few.
Most of my friend have had in the past just wanted to benefit from our relationshipit was not genuine.
Thats great. Im trying to get a girlfriend right now 
Yeah they are. It makes me sad too man.
Did you get a car as a gift? Thats exciting.
That is so nice of her! Thats really really generous. 
I think there must be a reason for that
Ohthats lifeso sorry for that
Do you have  a large network of friends and family?
Somewhat ive felt better these past couple months than i usually have
Yes definitely makes me feel like im doing soemthing good and helps me get better looking and healthier
What was bad about it?
Did you get a new phone?
Yes it is important. What happened?
That is bad and difficult to live. Sorry to hear that.
I am so sorry to hear that that is a real bummer. Were you injured?
That is absolutely awful! How long did it take for your ankle to heal?
wow what did you do to deserve the car?
thats intresting you must be very happy now
You should find something interesting to do.
Go hand out with friends or host a night over sleepthat would be fun.
Who are you waiting for a response from?
I dont understand the context of this conversation.
Wow thats awesome! What kind of car did you get?
Great to hear theyre really reliable good cars.
Oh really? thats sad why is that?
oof that sounds quite embarrassing hopefully it doesnt keep you down too long
A lot of the time. Im quite an easily frightened person! Especially by large animals!
Have you always had a fear of falling?
Congratulations. How much did you win?
Thats a lot of money. Can I have some of that?
Oh that sounds cool where to?
Sounds like a lot of fun I kinda wish I got to do those too back in high school.
You dont miss her?
I would suggest you go to china and visit her.
I was supporting England too  
Who do you think will win the cup
Yea but id still manage to leave something behind anyway haha.
Just anywhere like when leaving a friends place or taking stuff on a trip i somehow manage to forget one small thing occasionally
What steps have you taken to remedy the situation and make her feel safe?
I think thats for the best. Abuse is never okay.
Im sorry im not sure i follow.
Oh I see i can imagine that can get really frustrating
Oh notrust me if it were meshe would hear me good!
Wow but to have children in the house is good
Oh yes...children are blessings I love them being around me
Oh wow thats a big accomplishment congrats.
I feel the same college is stressful but its a nice environment.
Why dont u throw the trash awy?
Yeaas soon as possible
Im so sorry. You feel so helpless when someone you love is ill.
Oh Im so glad to hear that! I hope for her speedy recovery!
I cry everytime I watch dogs on TV always makes me sad.
Yes I a referring to the animal dog.
which team are you supporting
yeeees. I am alos supporting France. I hope it wins
Dont you worrythere is always a next time.
Try visit Barbadossuch an amazing place.
Im sorry to hear that. Thats an awful way to go.
Hopefully youre able to move on and be happy.
That is so annoying. What came up that he had to cancel?
Did you manage to reschedule? 
Thats really cool. What kind of dance do you do?
Thats awesome Ive always wanted to learn.
Yeah mostly when Im not expecting something new
Hahaha maybe you slept alot during the day
yes.my partner is very romantic person.
yes. I Of course you need a girlfriend and the girlfriend  is very lucky.stay blessed.
You are so welcomed!
You are funny.
Wow you are lucky.
That is good. Am really happy for her.
ok hope the sucessful in prayer.
Oh wow. Was he stationed there? 
What was it like in Japan did you ask? 
Did you find your shoe in the end?
Oh dear! Thats quite a mess! Did you have to pay any fees to rebook the flight?
No. I feel fine if a little tired. Do you?
Are you based in the US? Is it not about 2 am over there?
Yea my mother has been a huge support to me over the years how about you?
Yea my dad was really cool but he was also a drunk sadly so he was flip floppy
What do you mean exactly?
Oh cool well that sounds like a good time.
I hope you dont have work in the morning. Whenever I cant sleep easily I just give up trying and do something else.
Do you know them well enough to ask them to stop?
Oh about what exactly? Are you talking about family or friend or SO?
Ah ok was it fun then?
Oh yeah Ive been through quite a few sad things before. What about you?
Definitely the sad is needed to balance out the good.
I figure well all be there at some point once we get old.
My parents worked in them so I am used to them.
oooh sorry about that what happened
sorry i hope you areokay now
Where you the only one in the house?
Wow thats nice!
Wow thats a big messup! How did that turn out?
Good thing you found someone who had as big of feet as you do!
Why? What was the unexpected thing that happened?
Who bought you this golden watch? Was it a wizard?
Oh? Is it more of art than purpose in its form? 
Oh I see. A workable shelf then. 
Hahaha hope you did very well
Thats good....  I did well too
So did you get it?
That is cool. Definitely you will
Wow and you didnt get pulled over?
Mustve been some important meeting!
I dont know what flogging is.
Looking up the definition tells me its punishment by being whipped or beaten so unless you mean you were beaten metaphorically you shouldnt be wowing me.
Well done what type of performance was it?
Was it a ballet. I enjoy watching dance performances.
What did she surprise you with?
amazing! Thats really nice
What do u want to eat?
Okhave u prepared it?
normal is the best way it helps the mother bond with the child
we are adamant to have our baby born normal. I have seen first hand the CS mothers and their closeness lack of with their kids
You think so? 
Well Ive kept quite a few relationships throughout my life. If I actually wanted to look at online profiles I do it mostly for research or investigative purposes. Other than that Im only interested in online chat. 
Why what do you have planned?
Sounds like fun!  I hope you find the money to do it.
Great! you must be well prepared. Are you nervous?
Yes it sounds like you did everything right.  I hope you hear back from them soon about a job offer.
did you get what you needed?
well thats better than nothing at all 
Oh no Ive had a few days like that. Did you laugh it off?
Well good on you for toughing it out. Your the stronger for it.
what kin of food was it?
I love pasta
Wow that must feel good
that is great
wow that is very nice
that sucks. Sometimes it doesnt matter if youre surrounded by people you can still feel alone
the hardest lesson in life is that were all alone
Awesome. What type of music was played there?
oh my God. thats so cool. Hope the ticket was not expensive?
Who came back with a gold medal? 
Oh nice. Well if you work upon on something anything is possible if you work upon it. 
Hello friend! May I ask what it that you feel that way about?
I dont understand what you are talking about. Are you feeling okay today?
of course like they say happiness is contagious if you are happy everything around you stays happy and it will be hard to die young
Also your home stays blessed because you become a more better partner
Wow that must be lot of preparation 
Where is this event going to be
Thats amazing. Its good to give your head a rest so that you will recall all the items easily when you are at the exam center
I wish you all the best in the Exam
Thats good I am not sure if I can ask what happened? 
Oh wow I am glad that you are okay.
Omg I would have ran faster than forest gump... what did you do? 
Im glad no one was hurt! 
Oh no Im sure that was a hard memory to have brought up for you. 
What was her name? Have you read Rainbow Bridge?
What a beautiful name! Hopefully your memories are more happy than sad now.
Thats great. Teachers are so important.
I wanted to become a teacher before. I was afraid of how hard it would be.
Well congratulations! I hope your students appreciate you as much as they should.
Oh my goodness did you go to check what the noise was?
Im glad it wasnt anything serious! Its scary how quick our mind goes to the worst possible scenarios.
Thats really cool of them. You werent expecting it at all hu?
Parents can be great sometimes. Did you have a good time?
What did you find?
I love old school video games. What were your favorites?
Congratulations. Interviews can be stressful
Thats smart. And it worked.
Nice. What is his name?
Nice. I like dogs.
Oh my that sounds so scary! Was everyone ok?
Do you think you will ever zip line again?
oh no. What do you do for that?
Oh. How old is he?
Well I hope you are feeling better. What makes you so nervous? Are you worried your superiors will look down on you leaving early?
Im sure you can get in tomorrow and see how it looks. You can work together to make sure it works!
That is very cool! How much did it cost?
Wow sounds nice! Was it hard to do the work?
Dang that really stinks. Why did they quit so quickly?
Perhaps you should screen new employees better? Like give them a physical performance test?
I hope its nice for you. Do you have any alternate plans?
Well thats always a problem for me too but at least youve got another 1.25 now.
I think that is wonderful its about time more countries and states are making this medicine an option.
No but as Mark Twain once said the law is an ass. 
Im glad they made the right decision eventually though. Its about time!
The coolest race I saw was late at night on the highway out of town.
Yeah it can be pretty dangerous but I was young.
Im sorry to hear that. How long did you have him? 
I bet pets are amazing. Theyre hard to replace once theyre a part of the family
Oooh thats rough. Did you make him mad?
Well I hope you can work things out at least
Flying has seemingly become terrible these days. What about your trip was so bad?
That sounds frustrating and a little scary.  Did you eventually make it to your destination?
Thats too bad.  But better safe than sorry.
Not too much.  I used to fly a lot but not anymore.  I stick around home now mostly.
Well have you tried reliving that through the Pokemon app that you can interact with?
Yes I can understand that.. Sometimes nothing compares.. Have you guys played recently?
I know how that feels. I bet it was boring and lonely.
Did you get out and do anything?
That really is a big change for you! Are you excited to have some more down time?
Yeah that feeling will change when you see him coming home with a huge smile on his face!
Was it a long flight? Or was there lots of turbulance? 
Ah I cant imagine being up in the air that long! Sounds like it was a boring flight too. 
I guess that is one positive! 
No you should keep studying.
That stinks its never worth giving up though! What line of work do you prefer?
I can definitely believe that.. I hope something opens up for you soon!
What was so fun?
Oh yeah!!! I love taking my dog too she gets to get all that dang energy out before I bring her back to our little apartment!
That sucks I love dogs.
Yes I am sure she it.
Wow.. That is horrific!  Im so glad youre okay.. Was anyone else hurt?
Awesome. I am so glad to hear that.. Always good to hear the stories were someone gets away!!
I agree with that! I just had the rain cancel my trip to the beach yesterday! Makes me so mad...
I mean I like the rain at certain times.. But not when Im trying to do fun stuff outside!
That is such a brilliant idea are you excited about it?
Thats awesome youll thank yourself later down the road for making yourself do it!
Oh wow! I have heard of that happening to lots of people. Did they get arrested?
Yes they do. It has gotten really bad around here with car thefts. Its no wonder are car insurance rates are so high.
Oh really? Whatd ya get?
Math is a tough subject. Good for you.
Being good at math will open lots of opportunities for you. Keep at it.
How exciting that you were able to do that. I hope it was fun.
Its funny how you need a vacation to recover from vacation.
Howd it go
Thats great. Do you present often?
Glad you are safe!
Have you talked to her about it?
That doesnt sound too good. Has she been like this before?
Was it fun? Interesting? Engaging?
Good! Team based projects can be very hit or miss depending on your team so Im glad it worked out for you
Did she give you a reason?
Sorry to hear that i hope you find somebody else in your life.
Sorry to hear that.Did you lose money?
So you never actually lost the wallet.
That sounds amazing! How did it go?
Thats amazing I have only had one brithday party like that in my life.
I use to have a G.I Joe.
What were they sick from?
Ill bet you were surprised. Were you glad to see them?
Did you reconnect and promise to keep in touch?
Was she your girlfriend?
That is great did you have fun?
Yeah thats rough. I hate having to clean up mess that wasnt my fault.
Yeah that sounds annoying. Maybe try to scold the dog so they wont do it again?
That sucks. What was his name?
Barney was the name of my hamster.
I know that feeling. Its nerve racking trying to incorporate everything you learned at the DMV in real time.
Its also scary thinking about getting in a car accident the whole time that would definitely get me nervous.
My wife LOVES taylor swift. 
That is awesome I went to high school with Brett Favre! Small world.
I am glad you love her it must be a nice feeling
That is a good thing then
That wasnt smart.
Why did you then?
Dang.. my old roommate was an engineering student. He always told me how hard it was. What kind of engineering?
Yeah I think once you get in the field youre set. The jobs seem to pay well. Good luck with that you sound like you know what youre doing.
Oh the bus? Yeah I bet that was a little embarrassing. Sorry to hear that. I take my car for granted. Maybe you will get one someday.
Well keep working at it. Its a process. 
Where has he been?
Oh I bet you are excited then! He will be happy too!
Is there a reason why you didnt tell your boss?
Is there a way you could report it anonymously?
Oh I do too! I like a nice sunny day.
Its been really rainy. My power just went out awhile ago.
Yes it makes me pretty upset to be honest.
My brother used to have a yoyo! He did a trick called Around the world and also one called The cradle. Know those?
Oh yeah! I remember that! I wasnt good at doing any of them. I mostly just watched him. Good memories.
Oh man I would have terrified I hate being up so high. He sounds really brave!
Did he go on anymore after that?
Well hes young so you cant really fault him.
Thats good. You seem like a great parent.
does it happen often in your part of the country?
wow.  i can only imagine
Did she scream?
Did you get to? What happened?
I have never been there! Sounds fun but I dont support Sea World and the way they treat their animals.
OH GOSH! I would burn the whole house down. im terrified of spiders and bugs
i would have a heart attack!
I know how you feel. Life is too short.
Yes you do! Just keep living everyday like your last.
wow I never did understand why people want to get drunk in the first place. I sure hope he wasnt hurt.
it does sound like an amzing feat
ohh thats rough...did you talk to them about it
do they give you any kind of value...or do they just ignore you  put you down 90 of the time?
Is your relative okay now?
It mustve have been. Glad they are okay now.
Congratulations to him! You must be proud.
Hes very lucky to have you.
oh yeah what happened? 
omg is he upset? 
So did you help him  her
Thats pretty nice of you
Wow thats a nice car
It happens sometimes I guess
Memories.. what state? 
I understand but memories are always nice. 
What happened with your car then?
Ugh! that stinks! Did you found out who did it?
I would love that show
Oh well it happens
Have you been to the doctor?
You will be fine then
Well that is quite the accomplishment. 
He sounds like he has a great head on his shoulder. You must have taught him well.
Oh man thats so nervewracking. Do you think you guys will be a good fit?
Then it sounds like at least he has some perspective and ability to know not to overreact. I guess you could say you lucked out but that may be me speaking too prematurely
I hope you make it. Thats a big birthday.
That not good. Maybe she will understand if you just cant make it.
Wow... That would be one of my worst fears. How did they even manage to do that?
Wow! Any way they can get out? Did they call someone?
I know it is hard to start letting go but it gets easier with time.  Dont worry you are not alone.
Yeah they always seem to come back!  You just have to love them from afar for  a while.
Thats really sweet. We dont have gas station attendants here. But thats nice that theyre that helpful.
Ohh that makes sense. Yeah then thats really nice of them! And really sweet of her to offer a tip. I guess theres good in the world after all.
I would absolutely be scared too. Good news or bad I would be a worried wreck beforehand. Have you gotten it checked out yet?
Im so glad to hear it was good news though!
Thats great of you. Life is VERY unfair but we can go at any minute so cherish those you love!
It doesnt help us no. But you must take care of yourself too Take some time for yourself when being a caregiver ok!
Coming back to work could be good after a break.
That isnt good.
I wish I could feel that feeling unfortunately I am a man. What did you end up naming your son?
I am greatly looking towards starting a family with my wife as well. George is such a nice name.
I have  but not for anything that severe. Are you suffering any side effects of the stroke?
Yup  I know that feeling. And its always so hard falling asleep in those uncomfortable beds with an IV in your arm.
That really sucks man. Are you planning on looking for a new one?
Well as long as youre doing something you enjoy thats all that really matters.
Have you figured out whats the problem?
Sounds like maybe one of the legs on the table is bent? 
Yes? thats so cute but you have to be carefull not to say bad words in fron of them
OMG well it is a bad thing but now you can be more polite in front of them and also when you are not with them!
Are you keeping it as a souvenir?
Nice I do that sometimes with movie tickets if its a great movie that I enjoed a lot.
Ive been camping a few times  the proximity to others makes me feel stuffy too. Where do you usually go?
Oh wow! I bet the person inside wouldve pooped his pants but there was probably none left!
What happened?? Did you guys went camping or something?
Ho I am sorry to hear that.
Too late I already took it. Just kidding did you find it?
Oh thats bad. Was there anything important in it?
Wao thats so cool you must so excited how long has it been?
Wao it must be very difficult to be separated from your wife and son sorry
Oh yeah? Do you have to do that every game?
Thats funny. Well at least it sounds like you are always prepared. 
Thats cool. I am not a swinger either.
That makes no sense.
That seems like a good price.
right now its freezing in my home lol I just got out of bed after 30 mins of sitting because its coold
haha i live in virginia where right now the temperture outside is muggy 85 degress just regular ac pumping in my home
aw man that must suck how do you huys keep cool through the summer
Im sorry How long has it been?
Thats always a tragedy.
Thats nerve wracking for sure.  How did it go?
It probably went well despite the common jokes most parents want their child to date someone good so try to look for the best in people.
Oh nice! How long did you guys stay?
Oh no What happened?
Oh yea? Where are you guys? In the mountains? Camping?
Lakes are awesome. A body of water around here is pretty far. How long are you guys staying?
Did you get anything extra like a bonus or a trip.
Great. What business is it?
I can tell where this is going.
That has never happened to me. Thank god!
Well does that make you anxious?
Oh that would be rough. Ive been through that too.
But if is a great opportunity for him you should be happy.
Thats very nice of the friend. What sort of problem was it?
Bah those newfangled computers. Its nice to have a tech saavy friend.
Why do you think they do that?
Thats not fair and probably very frustrating for you. You need to say something to them.
Oh man I cant even imagine. I lived in Kansas for a while and we had a storm that did a lot of damage. Took out the power all day and stuff. Nature can be so devastating sometimes.
Jeeeze yea its totally understandable to be afraid. Has it been good there otherwise?
Its awesome to hear that! I guess no place can ever be perfect though. Heres hoping we both can live long happy and fulfilling lives!
That must be so disappointing. Is there something else you can do to have fun?
Sounds like you really like the water. So what do you do now?
Wow! Ive never been anywhere near there.
Ive been to the ocean a few times but Ive never even seen a surfer. We had a small boogie board.
I live in Tennessee
Wow. I must have a boring life then because I have only seen tug boats and barges on the Mississippi.
Oh no! How come?
Oh well maybe she has a lot of problems internally. You never know how someones home life is like.
Aw well its likely bipolar I know a phew. They have a hard time even on meds. 
I would save some and maybe get something you needwant?
For sure! Any extra money is always good!
Had she done that to you before?
What a shame! 
Oh man! I wish work stress would make me lose weight lol. I gain! Are you looking for a new job?
Oh I dont deal with that well. I hope you get a new boss!
Wow what brand
That is a nice car
Yeah all the time. I get so jealous
Wow that is hard to do. Congratulations my dude!
That sounds awesome!  Is Elbert a fourteener?
Hahaha.  Well I hope you dont get sick.  Take something salty with you maybe that will help.  Have fun!
Congratulations. I bet youre happy!
Do you work for a company or on your own?
Thats great! I bet that was a relief.
Wow that should have been amazing
Me too I love chocolate
Ive always been too scared to do a backflip. I always worry Im going to break my neck or something. Did it take him a long time to get it right?And did he get hurt?
Oh that makes sense. And Im glad to hear that. I always worry about that sort of thing. You ever think about trying to do it netx?
Are you sick?
That sucks I will pray for you.
Oh my that mustve been an embarrassing situation!
Thats ok you did the right thing. It probably happens to lots of people.
Yes what about it?
Tell me all about it.
I try to always go for extra sleep.
Wow! 30th is a big milestone birthday! I can imagine that everyone was excited to get to share that with you.
Did you feel old after?
That had to be relief. So now you wont have to deal with that frustration again.
Those keyboard shortcuts can be lifesavers.
Thats good. Everyone isnt so fortunate.
Its goof to have support when it does change.
We would all be better people then
oh wow. Bet it felt amazing. was it a mistake?
sounds like a great day. makes you wish it would happen everyday
Thats so embarrassing! What did you do?
Did anyone say anything?
Well at least you got away with it this time!
Do you normally feel like that when you fly?
I can understand that flying is scary.
Hey do you have anything on your mind?
I agree incompetent customer support is one of the worst things when dealing with such problems.
oh I am so sorry for your loss.
I bet. You gave him a good long life that was the best you could do.
I am sorry it was so stressful
Just hope for the best
ugh thats the worst right.. everyone should have holidays off. 
I say skip work next time p go for it 
i just love that my son knows ASL
i wish schools would teach kids asl 
she wants to spend time with you
that was nice of her
its a beautiful place
in that case i agree then
Where are you going on vacation?
That is close for me but it is a fun time!
i admire that 
no its not
I see have you tried yoga and meditation? 
Keep a positive mindset and your anxieties will be relieved! 
Oh my you must have very surprised! 
It must have been an enjoyable day. You have nice friends!
i bet she was so excited!! Did she love her presents?
that was me last christmas lol my son was only 9 months old but i bought so many presents and i was so excited to see his reaction
Oh no. Why are you worried to lose it?
Oh no.. That is a bit scary. I wish the best for you!
I am thank you for asking!
Oh no why not?!
They really cant. Its still no excuse though.
Oh that sucks...did she explain herself yet
Sounds like you need a new friend or your own car...or both lol
Thats terrible.  Someone should call animal control on them.
I hope they do something to help that poor puppy.
what happened ? 
did he end up biting you?? 
Oh no thats terrible!  Are both you and your dog alright now?
Yes that would have frightened me too.  Im glad hes alright now.
I hope and wish so. In this tough economic climate many are finding it difficult to cope with financial responsibilities
Being optimistic will help you alleviate much of your accumulated stress
that is literally the worst the people should have atleast told you to go ahead  first! 
its really so rude. ugh im sorry 
I love dogs too what breed do you have ?
i have a german shepard
Thats awesome.  What did it take for you to get there
Sounds like youve gotten smarter and more observant over the years
Oh how gross! I dont like possums anyways 
Just lizards and gators. I live in South Florida haha
I have heard about that game.  I heard there was one guy that makes about 500000 a month playing it on the streaming service Twitch.  Maybe your son should give it a try.
Twitch is just a place where people stream themselves playing video games.  I guess a lot of people really love watching good players.  Go ahead and retire now and get him started!
Im sorry your friend moved away. Sounds like me when I moved from Indiana to Florida. My friend was upset when I left too.
That is your friend you should be happy for them! 
Aw I am happy for you! What do you go to school for?
That is great! Good luck to you!
I bet! I cant imagine what that must be like to see a bran new life.
Thats awesome  Im happy for you! Hopefully one day I will get to see that
Hopefully the things coming out of his mouth are good things right?
Oh.  I recommend correcting that before it gets out of hand.  Good luck!
What movie were you watching?
That is a great movie.
I do.  It feels great to get out into nature doesnt it?
The beach is my most favorite place to go.
That sounds rough were you able to get accustomed to Texas?
I know what you mean that happened to me when I left for college a few years ago.
Wow that is really confident on your end. Are you going to do anything with the girl
That sounds exciting. Just make sure she is okay with it all before!
What was she referring to then?
I see.  Do you get a lot of storms in your location?
I always hate that when you are never on the right wavelength with someone during a conversation
That movie is a classic! I loved it as a kid!
Hahah! That is awesome!
get them reported
You are welcome if you take your stand they will  behave
I bet youre both excited and nervous about it! I have two kids of my own and one will be starting in about a year while the other is going to fourth grade.
Im sure it will! I hope it all works out for you.
Thats always a good thing. It means you should get on great with your neighbors.
Most of my neighbors are good kind people too so I know just what you mean.
Why did you feel anxious?
Hmm.. Im a little confused.  Why were you anxious?
Well thats sweet. How did the policeman react?
Oh wow! Thats awesome! Your son sounds like he has a bright future!
Ive done that before. Getting over that initial fear is really hard. But its fun once you do!
I understand completely. Its that initial anxiety. Its a scary thing to do!
I bet you are pretty anxious and excited at the same time.
its always nice when grandmas come visit.
Oh wow that sounds like it might be cool but I dont know what that looks like what is the 900?
Yea how old is your brother?
I love camping and understand why a hammock is your favorite. Theyre so comfortable!
That sounds amazing as long as youre not reading scary books about the woods!
I agree. Camping and hammocks are for relaxing and letting the mind be free. 
Ive actually never gone there. Whats it like?
Thats good to hear. I do plan on taking my kids in the future!
Do you live in Flordia? I have family down there and was really worried about them. 
That was lucky. Losing power is bad but at least that was it. Scary situation. 
What will happen if the secret is told?
Of course I only tell them the best ones though!
Oh no was she upset at you or about something else?
Well thats really kind of you to help her like that. Shes lucky to have you!
Ugh people can be so rude. Was he able to go to the bathroom?
Thats awful!! So what did you end up doing? Did he just have to pop a squat?
As long as you work hard and stay dedicated Im sure it will come!
Absolutely! And if you trust your boss Im sure he will do the right thing.
Thats scary.  Did you have to pull over?
I take it you made it out safe beacuse were here chatting
That sounds like an awesome Christmas present!  Ive actually thought about doing that with my girls now that they are older and not much they really need.  Where are you going?
Ive ALWAYS wanted to go on a Disney cruise  its probably my dream vacation. Im so jealous!!!
Thats such a great accomplishment and such a relief at the same time. What was your major?
I totally get that. I majored in business but sometimes I wish I majored in engineering. Im kind of glad I didnt though. Its hard!
Aww that is very nice of them. i just had to put mine down a few weeks ago.
Border Collie. Yours?
I can imagine! Did you end up having a good flight?
Thats good! Hopefully you had a nice seatmate too!
Aww was he scared?
I can see that. School is a challenging time for a kid.
Always good to feel ready for something like that. What subject was it in?
Man I remember those days. My engineering exams were killer. Did you do well on it?
Another mans trash is another mans treasure! What things do you save?
I keep a scrapbook myself! I love collecting stamps. Got any trips planned this year?
Im so sorry that happened to you. How did you handle this situation?
I hope no one saw that it mustve been terrible.
How are you going to learn! Why are you afraid to go?
It aint so bad. Im sure youll make a few new friends and everything will be just fine.
Please describe what scared you about the caves.
That seems like a valid reason to be scared of going into the caves!
Is there anyway you can move to somewhere more affordable?
I do too but its natural to get envious of others sometimes dont put yourself down over it.
That must be so annoying. I get that sometimes too.
Im sad to hear that Im sure there is someone who cars.
Thats good to hear that you care for your son so much. I am sure he will be quite an intelligent child going to the best of the best.
Yeah my village helped with my sons preschool tuition as well. Strength in numbers and good neighbors!
Oh yuck! Where did that happen?
During dinner? ACK!
Can you tell me about your recent experience?
Yeah I love Star Wars. I was sad when Han Solo died. He was my favorite character!
That would make me sad did you let him go? 
I know how you feel Im sorry about that at least he probably came back pretty quickly.
Im sure they will understand. You can always have another dinner thats the beauty of life!
Where did you end up going?
Oh no have you look at other options?
I really hope you get it!
Oh no. Did you flip him off?
That was probably for the best anyway. People who drive like that are the worst though.
Wow thats super annoying! I understand wanting to get things done early but thats not very respectful to neighbors.
Have you talked to him about it?
are you getting laid off?
im sorry i hope youre able to find an even better job immediately
Do you live in Florida?
Wow that sounds terrifying. You are very lucky to have made it out without any property damage though.
Thats amazing you must be a good person
Sometimes i like to not have other people asking things of me. Alone can be good.
Well at least you didnt have a lot of people under foot to slow you down. So I hope the sacrifice of being bored was worth it.
That is the worst. At least you and your husband got something worked out for your sons first day at school! 
 A walk down memory lane.
Oh I bet! Its always good to cherish those memories.
oh that can be annoying did you tell him anything?
hahah thats kinda funny. Maybe he just missed you!
Nice! Where did you go?
Oh that is really cool! What a great experience and fun to bond with your dad!
Was it long?
Thats long I understand the reason behind you being upset 
I know how you feel its always good to bond with your buddies when you can
Thank God you will be able to tell them in person about how much you miss them
Oh yea I can relate to the good times is she still alive?
oh no. May her soul rest in peace
Congrats! Im sure you will have great memories. 
I believe you will just continue doing what youve already done.
Yes I am married
I am happy and yes its a lot of work. Anything worth having takes work to keep it.
HAve you been practicing? Do you have note cards?
I hope you do well. IS it for school?
Well congratulation on your A in advance lol
Oh my gosh! Was it a wild tarantula or a pet?
Thank goodness! The biggest type of spider we have here if a wolf spider. They dont really bite you unless you irritate them.
Oh awesome! How are they doing?
Awesome! Its nice to see people who knew you so long ago. No friendships like those!
Wow thats really great. What charity did he donate to?
Oh sorry. Thats awesome. What does his charity support?
Was the weather nice?
I cant wait until we get nice weather. ITs too hot to do anything
Some people have no concept of being rude.
no they dont.
Are you serious? That is extremely terrible news to hear.  
I really wish I knew what to say but even watching my mother go thru stage 4 I still dont know what to say! Spend a lot of time with your loved ones! 
Really isnt that unusual?
Im glad it worked out so well for you all .
I know how stressful that can be. I hope everything turned out alright.
That is great news!
That wasnt nice. I hope they caught them.
That sucks how much is it?
I can relate. You just have to be yourself.  Do you know if you got the job?
That’s great!  How do you like it?
Is it sunny where you are ?
Glad for you its cloudy and humid here.
Why did you wait a week? Tell her to tell him
I dont know. You should have told hime when it happended. Just do it and get uit out of the way so you both can move past it.
Thats nice. I always like getting letters.
no I never did. It might have been nice.
58 million. Thats unbelievable.
Well you know how to get it from  him right?
ah congratulations on the engagement! How long have you two been together?
No problem. I hope shell love it as well.
Oh no. Did you guys talk about it?
No ones perfect. I hope you wont hold a grudge.
Being prepared pays off soemtimes.
how did you do on it?
Good well I hope you get the better position!
How strict is the budget?
Ah that makes sense well I hope it goes well for you!
Nice. Did his team finish first?
At his age they progress very quickly
Thats very nice of them! Having caring friends is very important.
What did they do for you?
I bet it does you should find a podcast you like
That is smart I would recommend a nintendo switch!
Im sorry. Any way you can get out of it?
Have you always been scared of heights?
Yuck!  You didnt get wet and muddy I hope!
That is good to hear.  No one likes soggy shoes!
Backflips are scary. Neck injury is serious.
Thats good! They do look cool too.
I was scared the first and only time I flew also. Where were you flying to?
Oh wow! I bet that was really exciting. I have never been out of the country.
You must feel horrible!  Get her something extra nice and I am sure she will forgive you!
Get her flowers and a gift certificate to a nice massage place!
I have the same feeling. I miss her also
Are you going to have it completed in time?  I hope you are not behind schedule!
Ouch!  You better knuckle down and burn the midnight oil!
Wow! I would be amazed too!
Thats so true. Im 30 and just now having the time to work on my bachelors. But I have a lot of work experience.
Same here. Well I hope he can adapt and do well. Good luck with your BA too!
Wow. Thats pretty hypocritical.
I think shes just trying to cause a problem.
Did you not have your own food?
Oh no! That sounds horrible! Did the coworker find out?
Oh wow. Give me the details.
Are you missing an organs?
Well At least youre in one piece. you could have been in several.
Not really? How come?
Oh wow the BBQ must be delicious.
Thats a profound thought. We definitely take America for granted especially when some people say its in its worst state in a long time. Were prisoners of the moment.
Yeah I guess you would know for sure since youve seen it first hand. Especially a place like Haiti thats just gets pounded with hurricanes. What brought you to Haiti if you dont mind me asking?
I am sorry to hear that.Is there a chance you forgot your wallet home?
That story could become a movie script.
That’s a bummer. Drink some coffee
Try drinking a lot of water and cutting out soda
Is it not going to happen?
You should find another job. No use being miserable. Or tell her boss!
Ah gotcha. A few of my friends teach English to Chinese students online and I think they have taken ESL courses
That really sucks! What do you have to do?
I do too.  I am so sorry you are going through this
Wow. I had that DVD.
I know. I wonder if they still do that show
Some dads are cool like that. My mom is that way sometimes.
I just went on a trip with my mom and sh paid for almost everything
Are you a busdriver?
Ah gotcha. I hate it when things happen out of our control. Hope you get it figured out
Hi what you got going on?
That is really sad.  Are you alright?
Im sorry.  Will you be able to pass this semester
Im sure it will happen.
I dont think you will need to worry then.
Sorry to hear that. Why did they not attend?
Hopefully your friend can make it up to you and hang out with you some time soon.
Ha hope you arent too scarred about being all by yourself.
Watching too many horror movies I bet. Just put on some comedy special.
Thats quite an accomplishment. You must have worked very hard.
That must have been a very hard time. Your persistence led you to this success because you never gave up that hope.
Thats very good. It takes a disciplined person to save money
You truely are determined to get that car what brand is it?
I hope you pass your exam. Did you do good at your exam?
Really? What happened? 
Wow cool! Did they let you in? Its so cool you had that opportunity.
Ick. Ive never heard of anyone having a really good experience with that.
Ah I see. The classic photo trick. I understand why you would be upset about that. Thats definitly why its so important to go see before you buy
Hi tell me whats going on with you?
Oh Im well thank you.
Oh really? Any reason why?
Wow really? Thats pretty rude and bad in general for an employee to be doing.
Thats neat! Ive only seen ducks and chickens. A deer did bounce over my car once though
I guess it didnt turn out well?
oh.  SWEET!  Congrats!  What are you going to do with all that money??
Save it for SpiderMan that comes out next month!  I cant wait for that
And more to come hopefully!  Dont forget to save for retirement andor emergency fund D
Am doing well thanks and you?
fine. But I think youre suppose to do the prompts so hope it doesnt cause you a rejection.
What have your experiences been like?
Thats good to hear! Hope that it continues that way.
Oh I hate that. Is it a high interest rate?
Its highway robbery. Well I can only hope you can pay it quickly to avoid as much of that as possible.
Thats great  sorry for the error and unrelated message previously sent  but you do have great friend that are dependable
Oh my god that must have been so embarrasing! Was there actually a fire?
Its okay at least now you can look back at it as a funny moment.
Oh no I hate having connectivity problems! Are you having bad weather?
Oh it has been raining here a lot too. I will keep my fingers crossed that your wifi keeps working!
Yes I am here
Oh no I bet that was stressful. What did you do?
I like my alone time too. What do you enjoy doing by yourself?
Oh thats is fun. Its a way to be alone with your thoughts but still be around others. I love to watch people! 
Yes I can related to that feeling
Well a great morning leads to a great day 
Which movie did you watch?
That is a very scary movie! How are you coping?
What was hurtful may I ask?
That sounds like very bad treatment You should sue them
Maybe you havent done anything terribly wrong that anyone would feel remorseful about. Do you think thats it?
Maybe. Its none of my business but sometimes when people feel this way they could be experiencing depression. 
I suppose it is.
You always have options!
Sounds like someone who is actually not a friend. How long have you known her?
I used to work with a girl like that. She always talked bad about me but was nice to my face.
I cant say that I really do. Its always a mystery in my mind.
I believe I see it more as that type. No one can truly know.
I know what you mean. Wednesdays theres this market I like to go to but lately it just has so much rotten food
Totally. I still love to go have a look around
Yes it is partially true. What is the problem?
That is very true. Did something bad happen to you?
Generally just try to ignore it as best as you can. Im good about just letting things roll off my back.
Oh no! Those can be difficult to spot sometimes.
Wow. That must have been stressful. I have babies too. Did they understand?
That is a relief. Sounds like you made it just in time.
I get it. Sometimes I feel stressed out for no real reason myself.
Well sometimes companies make mistakes. I doubt its anything you did.
I think its very common that we take things for granted. 
I think you can really think about all that you have and show your thanks that you have these things. 
What was depressing?
Oh that sounds like a bummer. Do you think it will change?
What is the name of the show?
No I ever did.
why hasnt it already been returned?
if you live in america and they fail to return it in a timely manner i hear you can go to small claims and get 3x the amount awarded to you 
yeah rlegaladvice has a lot of posts like that so its something that stuck to me Pretty neat to know that landlords cant just scam you
Thats cool. Ive always been a Mac kind of girl but I would look into a Surface is I was in the market for a new computer.
I get that. I got a bamboo tablet a few years ago but I feel like working directly on the screen would be even better.
what was ?
oh that does sound nice
Well in some ways solitude is nice.
True everything is nice in bits. Too much of anything does get tiring.
Be responsible about what?
I understand. I have to get work around my house done today too before I can go out.
Oh no sorry to hear hope you are OK.
I agree. Hope the car will look good again.
Sorry to hear that. Did you try to talk to a friend?
I agree where did you find them?
Oh I see Ha! I would have just worn them like that to be more fashionable!
Was it an accident?
Oh ! Thank good ness! That was close
do you especially enjoy macadamia nuts or just eating?
It must be difficult living with a nut allergy. Do you overeat on macadamia nuts regularly?
Its awful out there. Its been in the 100s here in TX
That sucks! I hate wasps and most other bugs so I feel your annoyance.
what job did you apply to?
Somehow i suspect that theyre not looking forward to having you though P no offence i cant remember anyone that enjoyed high school lol. Its a good job though! literally backbone of society
Yeah thats always comforting.  Moms are awesome
Not really.  We usually tend to think alike.  Why do you ask?  
Cool.  So youre the awesome mother here?
 did you stay friends with him?
did you get admission? 
Thats great news well done. 
Me too especially when its still the middle of the day.
Oh yes youre right. Im in the same boat right now!
I think I am missing something you said you feel more that ok after 3 pizzas???
Its definitely some kind of anomaly. 
What did you eat there? 
ooooh onion soup sounds really good onions do taste incredibly well if cooked well with the correct dish
I would have flipped and never talked to him again. I am so sorry my god what did you do? 
Idk beat him up lol. throw a drink at him the sky is the limit! 
cool how did it come by?
if you put so much work into it im sure they will
I am so sorry! I would have a hard time forgiving that betrayal of trust. How long have you been together?
Wow. I hope that you can work it out but I would understand why you wouldnt want to.
really? well who doesnt!
i actually feel like a kid even now during christmas
wow what was it?
woohoo! you are one lucky child!
No way! I just moved from NY to FL. You are going to love NY tho its an awesome state. Congrats on the job! 
Oh yeah sounds like its super new to you especially if you are in the city. I was in the middle of no where so pretty much felt like Idaho where I lived in NY. p 
I would too why would she not tell you!? Did yall break up? 
That sounds like poor communication on her part maybe its better for you she moved.  
What incident was that ?
what happened then ?
I know what you mean it sucks when those dates linger over us even if we try not to think about them. Im so sorry to hear that! 
Its not time to get over it you arent doing any wrong its okay to feel things. I hope people around you give you a lot of love! 
i understand what you are saying pets are always close to our hearts
yeah i have 2 german shepards
is it a scary movie?
no i never heard of it
yea thats probably the best choice to make
Yuck that is terrible. I would be grossed out too. What did you do?
Im sure you did. Guess he couldnt make it to the trash can.
oh thats really sweet!
oh no.. i hope you feel better
Those are great aren
SorryThose are great arent they? I do not but we always had sunday breakfast for many years. Those memories are to be cherished and repeated 
wow that is a lot to take in.  get a muzzle
Do you think it was the right decision?
Thats great. Maybe you will get a raise too
oh i can understand that
That must have been terrifying
I dont know what I would have done
Awesome! What kind of dog is Lola?
I dont think I would have been able to stop smiling either! That is so awesome!
Thats nice is she technologically savvy?
Well its nice shes making the effort!
I do too. I have a box filled with them. How old is your oldest?
Thats good. Now you dont have to worry about it.
Wow your son is lucky to have a parent who is on top of things!
What did you bet?
That would be awesome! Did your cousin pay you?
Oh no I am sorry to hear that. I hope she is okay.
I am so sorry. I hope she is able to get some relief and rest.
Oh man! That must have been great to hear! What did he say?
Thats so funny! Thats one of those things you will definitely remember forever!
Oh I can understand that! I would also like to be outside it looks like such a beautiful day! At least it is almost the weekend!
Thats great! Are you going to join your friends at the park?
You should have taken a flashlight just in case. 
hey at least you got a nice workout in!
That is true. Well Im glad you made it home safely. Maybe next time maybe go a little earlier before it gets so dark out.
I had ice cream too! Sorry you got sick
Ha at least it was good
Thats always fun! Does your pup do well with other dogs?
Mine does the same thing. Goldens are so adorable.
He is just a mix breed. We really dont even know.
lol it happens to us all
That sucks did you need to return something?
That stuff is pretty expensive. Maybe you can sell it on eBay or something.
Oh wow! I would have been so disgusted and outraged! What did you do?
That must have been a terrible experience. Im not sure that I would be able to wear that jacket again.
i hope you do really well
going to see some old friends this weekend
Good job what did you work hard on?
Nice keep it up!
That is awesome!  What are you studying
was it hard to go back or are you enjoying it?
Well good luck!  I am sure you will do great!
I do like the rain though
I am sure you will have plans again
Yeah I am sure it will be fine
I would have been to. I always wonder how people make the money necessary to buy vehicles like that.
Same here. I saw a Ferrari at the supermarket the other day. I was jealous and I also thought about how I would be worried something would happen to it if it were mine.
I take you dont have issued with you weight.
Ok then.If it was a 1 thing only no problem.
Is he acting creepy at all? 
Have you tried to talk to him at all and see what his deal is?
Thats good you have wellbehaved dogs did you train them?
Well its good youre doing something right.
Oh no! What did you do to bring yourself down? from the panic attack
Im sorry. That sounds bad. Flying always makes me nervous but I usually make it ok.
Well we are friends arent we? I do appreciate you as one.
You wanna maybe go to the bar with my other friends this weekend? They will probably like you. Tim likes some things you do.
Oh i hate it when i get those kind of thoughts but eventually you recover and dont think about it.
Just relax more you got this and it was just a fender bender.
Naptime is a good thing though isnt it
Well that is never good
That doesnt sound too fun
Oh wow the kid is a snitch
It happens everyone does it
I am sure you will fix it
Have you spoken to him about it?
Are you going to do anything about it in the future?
congratulations im glad hopefully you will like it more than your last job
im glad to hear that
what kind of pizza?
what!! i hope u got your money back
Did your car end up overheating?
Thats great! But what did they do that you didnt like?
Well looks like that didnt work out for him in the end. What finally got him axed?
Did you replace it?
Do you think hell get angry?
did you start walking faster?
hopefully you made it out safely
That is good to hear. What happened that made you think so?
Oh ok. That sounds like they really get along well. It is nice to have good neighbors.
Oh no!  Was he OK?  I hope it was nothing serious!
Thats good to know!  You all have a lot to be thankful for!
I would hope so too or else the relationship would be awkward.
I hope it wasnt too much money just in case.
What you you have planned?
Really?? It sounds like there was something going on.
Oh thats never a good situation. It happens to the best of us though. I need to clean my fridge
Im sure they were thinking waste not want not. haha
Oh yeah? Find anything interesting?
Ah nothing quite like that feeling. I remember when I was on the school newspaper. Good times.
Are you going too?
Oh no that sucks. Would you have wanted to go though?
Well thats not cool.
Does he do that stuff often?
Oh? What kind of project?
Oh thats nice of them! 
Thats good do you get paid over time?
I think if you keep it up youll get the recognition you want soon.
Was everything okay? What were they doing?
True you never know these days.
Is your phone waterproof?
You are so lucky! My phone would have been done...
Thats great! Are you seeing results?
I bought a spin bike but I havent used it yet
Maybe they were left for you.
He cant save them out in the open. What kind were they?
Did he get it back? I hate it when that happens...
You are a true friend indeed. I bet he is very appreciative!
Did he eventually find one?
That is making progress.
Congratulations!  What do you plan on doing?
That is a great goal to set for yourself.
I am sorry to hear that. I hope the results will be good.
It is good new.
Was it an intruder?
What a surprise haha
I did too. Did you go out last night?
Well I stayed up late too. Drinking beer and playing vidos games lol
Holy goodness! Thats so cool. What will you do there?
Oh my god! Thats something to be proud of congrats!
I am sorry you are feeling like this.  Maybe you should reach out to someone
I am sorry that you are going through this
Oh wow now thats funny! Ive only been on one roller coaster and it was rather small but I loved it!
Oh wow! Id love to go on a much larger coaster than the one I road. But it might be scarier than I imagine.
They are still cute at this age and they make a lot of progress.
Oh no! Well hopefully she wasnt too upset then youll know how her character is 
Oh no! Well honestly if she cant deal with one mistake then its no good anyhow. But maybe it was something else. Sometimes people just dont click.
I feel you! I dont like to perform in front of people either. Did you decline?
Oh you can be as bad as you want there it just matters if youre having fun 
Wow  i bet it was a long day of moving but i can imagine the joy you must feel inside you congratulations !!!!
I used to move furniture for my old job so i bet it was a lot of heavy lifting its so exciting to finally have your own place
I hope you do! What is the test on?
Oh man. That was a difficult subject for me after Physics. Are you a science major?
I understand how lonely it can be when your schedule doesnt fit with your old friends.
You can make new friends. Its just part of the human experience. Everything is temporary
Oh no. I am so sorry to hear that!
Dogs are with us for such a short amount of time. Kinda wish they lived as long as us.
Friends can be so awesome!
What did they help you with?
Im sorry to hear that. Where did they go?
Oh man Sometimes its hard to strike that work life balance.
Are you going to wear a suit?
War would be terrifying. What makes you think we will?
Yea. Seems to be more of that lately.
What have they been doing?
Do you honk at them?
Wow. He must be really strong! Whyd he lift the car?
Oh Ive heard of those contests. Must be exciting to see.
What is the protest for?
What happened? Why were they being limited?
They do love to surprise ya dont they?
Interesting. I didnt know that. So did you end up taking it outside?
Family time is so precious. Are your kids still with you?
They grow up so fast sometimes.
Im so sorry to hear that!
Did they say why?
Yea I totally get ya on that.
Man are you me? People been annoying lately?
Here I was hoping a Walmart would open in my area. Guess its a good thing there isnt one.
Oh which Disney? Sounds exciting!
Whats your favorite thing to do there?
Yeah It bothers me when people dont take responsibility for their actions.
Lol. Why didnt she tell you?
So youre not gonna see her again?
Gotta have brains
Why did you stop?
Wow. I drink Dr Pepper like coffee.
I bet. I get that feeling every morning with a Dr Pepper
Why would you have twenty dollars on the desk
OH. Thats terrible.
Congratulations on your hair.
where is that
oh id love to visit there one day when its a more stable area
I know! Its almost an unexplainable feeling isnt it?
But it is also the best feeling ever! Enjoy every moment!
Best advice I ever got was that housework can wait and take naps whenever you cam when the baby sleeps!
What did you almost buy?
Ah yea Ive had the once or twice. When you buy used you have to go in with the mindset of haggle down find a decent one or leave
I love heavy rain it just really soothes me.
I know! Also the thunder is so cool to listen to.
I did a research on a cancer vaccine  
Oh sorry for the mix up
OK. I hope you are now fine?
Never. I hate cats personally
Ive come to hate them too unfortunately. Constant noise
Oh thats so sad. What earthquake?
Oh thats a big one. I bet it caused a lot of damage
Aw thats so sad! Did you help it?
I guess thats fair but I probably wouldve taken it to the vet.
Me neither. Its why I hate living in London
Nope. We just remain miserable year round
Music can be so touching to the soul.
Who was the artist of the song?
I like incense. Did you find the cause of the bad odor?
Oh well I hope you can fix it soon
What made you realize that? You cant live in fear
Its good to face your fears
Oh was it a bad or naughty thought?
What was it? Was it really that crazy?
I think that happen in a lot of families.
I understand. You were the only one getting hit?
ooh my God he hurt himself
so bad i can imagine that loose he made to you
how was it ?
wow i can only imagine
thats a good thought to have
i totally agree with that
wait til she leaves and continue
Sounds like an interesting job.  Im sure its taxing on the family though.
In the end is the trade off worth it?
I am so jealous. He is one of my all time favorite actors. 
Were you star struck?
Oh no.. what did you do?
I would have done the same as well
Oh no.. Im sure you did not feel great when you found out
I would be too. Hopefully that gets resolved soon
That is exactly the way you are supposed to feel. Did you get the job?
Good for you! Congrats buddy
oh yea congrats.. what will you be doing
that sounds like a good career
thats really cool. How did he react?
This is such an awesome coincidence buddy
Oh yeah i hear that it is really scary
Oh no.. But it gave you such a memorable experience as well right?
Oh so sorry to hear that.. what did you do?
I hear you.. dont worry things will be ok soon enough
I am sorry to hear that.  You werent hurt were you?
Were you at fault?
aww.. that is so sweet.. i bet every parent feel that way
oh no.. i feel sorry for you buddyt
Oh wow. is it really as scary as the reviews say it is?
Damn sounds like such a stunning experience
I can image thats pretty disgusting.  What your friend sick or drunk?
You can only do so much.  Next time Id just let him drink on his own.
Oh lord.. How did it happen?
God.. That is really disgusting yes
That sucks.  How long have you been a teacher for?
Yeah Id imagine.  The months off for summer is nice though.
So why didnt you just pay for them your self?
Sorry to hear that.. Why were you alone?
I hear you.. Socialize get new friends.. You will start adapting
Oh dear lord.. Was he sick or something?
haha.. Sorry i couldnt help but picturize it.
Holy.. What did they want?
I see.. Any specific reason for that?
It is really good to have that level of discipline
Same here.  It helps make cooking go smoother.
Agreed.  No sense wasting time while cooking by looking for odds and ends.
i bet you did.. Felt nostalgic huh?
that is really innocent and sweet of you my friend
Aww.. Did you used to go as a family to the beach?
Such a sweet story.. So happy just to hear that from you
WOW!! She is my absolute favorite!
So true.  I was so jealous of brad pitt over the years
Aw.. sorry about that my friend. Have you made any friends?
So true.. family is everything!
Oh no what did he do?
Aww you got to admit that is so cute as well
That is really sweet my friend. It is nice to see old friends
Aw i am missing my high school now that you said it
Haha. Do you love sports cars that much?
Such passion for cars. Wish you can buy one soon mate
How much better did it pay?
That is not too much I think you made a good choice
Sorry to hear that my friend. Why did you move?
I see.. Dont worry you will own your new city soon enough
I am sorry to hear that why did you move there?
Did you end up buying anything?
Well is it close to where you live? That would be cool to go back often
that is a good tactic actually it boosts your confidence
Very true. We should believe in ourselves for others to do that
Oh my god sorry to hear that my friend.. Were you guys close?
How sad.. Find peace knowing that she is in heaven now
what did she get sick off  im sorry to hear that your a great to your wife
When i get married i want to be like you  and take care of my loved one 
That sounds tough.  How do you think you did?
Me tooIm sorrry you had to go through that.  At least its over now right?
Maybe they know a friend who knows a friend.
Yep thats the way of the world especially with Universities to.
A duplicate? Like a fake?
That  sucks.  Id be very upset.      You have to be careful who you order from online.  Some times if the price is too goot to be true its a fake product.
Oh no that is so frustrating! What did you do?
Ah yes a glass of wine might help to make that feel better. Still what a pain. Lousy end to a lousy day. 
I would be so lost without my phone but I could make it through an evening. The house keys though! 
Was it some fraudulent transaction posted on your account?
So it was your partner who used you card
Oh no! Was anyone hurt?
Thats pretty scary.  Did the boar survive the ordeal?
Are you willing to go on another safari?
Im not surprised.
Thats very intense. I am sorry you had to experience that.
Thats good. Time heals all wounds and can be a powerful cure to pain and disdain.
You are telling me you are a hoarder?
Everyone is nostalgic one way or another.You are fine
Oh my goodness! Thats terrible. Did anyone see? My face would be bright red.
Im sure this will be one of those times where you cringe when you think back on it! Im sure you made those guys days though
Thats crazy! Im glad there was nothing there.
Some horror movies are so great that they make you consider your own environment.
Thats great. I bet it was wonderful experience.
Thats cool. Taking that experience into the next phase will be pivotal.
I am sorry to hear that.Did you get hurt.
Do you have full cover?
Where did this happen?! Were there any other people with you?
Did it happen while you were in the store? I hope that your kids did not see anything too disturbing.
Oh that is pretty cool. What did you think?
Yeah we were blissfully unaware of the real world in those days. It must have been nice to reminisce.
That has got to feel good!  You must feel very happy and relaxed!
Cherish this time you have because you never know when it could change!
What restaurant is it for? 
Sounds good. I love mom n pop restaurants. So much better than big popular restaurants.
That sounds really interesting. Were there any good matches?
Well at least you are putting yourself out there. A lot of people give up on finding love.
Oh no I hate cavities. Are you brushing your teeth eVeryday?
Dang that sucks. I hope you can find a solution for that
Wow you must be proud! He might cure cancer next!
Geniuses dont do chores my friend.
Im so sorry to hear about your mom. Its good that youre at peace with it though. 
But a part of her is still here in you. 
They left you all alone? I bet you feel lonely...
I know that feeling. I like to keep the TV on to drown out the silence
Whoever ate it all is evil!!!
I know right. I would be so furious!
I would do it! Try to be calm about it at first and see how he responds.
Yeah something should be done about it!
Ive done that before when I was just annoyed with them. Dont feel bad!
Who cares! I always like to think of satisfying myself first before others!
Oh no! Thats a smelly situation to be in. What did you end up doing to fix it?
What a pain! I bet that cost a fortune. Did they end up repairing all the portions of yard that they had to rip up?
That must have been a great reunion! Who was happier him or you?
He was lucky to have you waiting there for him!
Ugh I hate when unexpected expenses arise.
Well that was nice of them. I hope you take them out to dinner after you pay them back.
Wow great for her! I am confused as to how you ended up GAINING though!
Well keep at it and you will get where you want to be. It really just comes down to how many calories you take in vs. how many calories you burn per day.
Please tell me you won a lot of money.
lol Thats how I would of reacted too. One hundred dollars can buy you a lot of stuff.
OH NO! Thats infuriating. Did the stain come out?
Hopefully they remember
Did you brush it right out?
Maybe you could give them a call on the phone and tell them about your feelings?
You could go to the party. And then learn how to swim!
Yea and you can bring some water toys to play with!
Awesome! I bet you felt proud at what you accomplished. Did you have this goal in mind for a while?
How much total weight did you lose and how long did it take?
Thats awesome.  I wish I could go.  Where are you going?
Cruises are awesome.  You get to eat as much food as you want.  Youll probably put on like 10 pounds
Aww man I hope you brought your raincoat.
Thats good you dont want to get soaked and catch a cold.
Thats amazing. You must have been so surprised and happy!
Did you get a video of it?
Gee he must have been really hungry! Thats a lot of eggs!
Wow.. thats unbelievable. I wonder how his cholesterol is. 
Oh dang that really sucks. I cant believe TSA would go that far it mustve been super embarrassing. 
Dude you should definitely report it someone or the company because you could probably get something out of it.
Oh yeah what was it called? I really love roller coasters!
I saw that one on TV. It looks absolutely nuts. I hope to visit Cedar Point one day!
Oh I hope you get some good news. I am sure it would help you getting aid for college.
All you can do is be patient and see what happens. I am sure everything will work out for you.
Thats awesome. I hope it works out for your friend and their fiancee. Are you excited to be there?
Well I am sure they appreciate you being a part of their big day. Enjoy the after party!
Wow that sounds fun. What type of artwork did you see?
Gee she must have her hands full! I hope she does well as an artist!
Did you feel very emasculated by this?
Yeah I can see that viewpoint as well. She may end up carrying you to bed next time!
Im glad he returned home safe and sound. Did he have fun on the camping trip?
My mom was the same way. Its all part of being a parent. I hope to have kids soon too and I worry about stuff concerning them myself!
Oh wow I bet the emotions of that came back to you.
Yes those memories are what make life so special.
So not a surprise but still nice to get? 
Wow thats very admirable of you.  People who abuse animals are the worst kind of people.
I have 2 dogs myself and I could never imagine hurting them.  I cant believe there are people out there who think that that is ok. its sick.
Yeah those were the days. When we had no worries in the world.
That sounds really cool. I always wanted a treehouse but never had a good tree for it.
Oh yeah why is that?
I would have them towed!
Oh so you have to have a sign up to legally tow them?
Or you could just park behind them so that they would have to knock on your door before you let them out.
Thats awesome. Which Disney park did you go to?
Ooh I live pretty close to it. You have a great husband to give you that treat!
Thats good that you found happiness. Thats what were all in the pursuit of right?
You are blessed. Make sure to spread the positive energy. 
thats great that you can trust her.  how old?
Thats great. Be thankful some people arent so lucky.
what did you almost buy?
Its hard to find good quality at walmart
I would try target.  good quality stuff there.
try googling it and read thru the reviews
Finding a buyer can be tough.  You have a good agent?
Does it have a good location?  You know the only rule of real estate right?  Location Location Location.
Sounds good.  Definitely should target a family buyer then
You got a figure in mind for your house or are you letting the agent handle that as well?
Thats never good when you have a bad manager.  What made them so bad?
Know it alls are the worst.  Hopefully you are in a better spot now with a manager who cares.
Oh no! Whats wrong with your dad?
Aw Im so sorry to hear that. Its not easy to watch our parents age. 
We can surely hope! 
That must have made you feel terrible. Were you able to find the dog?
I sincerely hope you can find him! But I bet your neighbor will understand it was just a mistake and you didnt do it on purpose.
Doesnt he understand that people have to go to work in the morning?
You might have to file a noise complaint with the police.
What is causing you to question whether its the right thing for you or not?
Yeah Ive done that as well.  It can definitely be a hard job considering dealing with the public hours during holiday seasons etc.. But sometimes if the pay is good it can outweigh some of the negatives.
lol that remind me of a movie i saw with robert deniro  thats absolutly bizzare by the way but cool at the same time
wow  i would love to have a cat like yours 
Aww thats too bad that no one else could go.  What concert was it?
haha that must have been a crazy concert! 
Sometimes that depends on the industry. If she works in ones that have high turnover its not a big of a deal as say an administrative job
Well Im not entirely sure about the banking side but I wonder what shes looking for. Perhaps a small vs big bank culture
OOO I love doing that but not so much the upheaval in the midst of it.  What room are you going to be working on?
Still a new color can definitely brighten up a space and make it feel all new!
Thats awesome!  I wish I could wake up that way every morning.  Did something specific make you feel that way?
Ha!!  Well Ive woken up from a dream and been mad at my husband because of something he did in my dream  I guess it can go the other way too!
Ive done that before... I enjoyed it too! I love looking back at old pictures and stuff
Some of it but my grandma did save a lot.  I plan on doing that with my kids
I love cheese too! What kind of cheese was it?
Gouda is great! Do you like prosciutto too?
Aww poor baby hopefully shes doing fine now.
Thats great to hear. You have one tough cat.
Ha I used to do that too. But I was almost always disappointed by the toy once I actually got it.
True! McDonalds was my first job when I was 14 and I remember being stoked I could now collect ALL the toys even if I didnt play with them!
Did they tell you when you may hear back from them?
I pray they get in touch with you soon and thats is an affirmative on the job!  I know  how nervewracking waiting can be though  I hope you get it!
Arghhhhhhhhh! I soooo feel for you and have been there. Have yall had the chance to talk about it? Or do you even want to?
I hear you. Maybe humor might help? Like okay so this is awkward....can we talk about that email? Heartfelt apologies go a long way and even if she doesnt respond  youll feel better for trying.
Are you sure they didnt bring the wrong bill?
I would have complained.
Ohh I feel sorry for you
Ohh thats bad. You can always skype your family!
Yes I feel you. Cleaning sucks but after all that hard work the results are amazing!
Me too! You seem just like me!
That sounds very exciting! What kind of planning did you put into such an achievement?
Thats so cool! I wish you the very best and hope that the blood sweat and tears turns into happiness joy and fun times!
Are there any other family members out there that could help her?
Wow I hope that she was able to work things out. Not the best way to start living somewhere far from home but Im sure she figured something out.
Thats great! I am happy for you!
Yeah and they are paying you good enough. You are a luckiest person!
i honestly have never gone to jury duty  but im sure it was still a pain to put it on your schedule 
same thing i heard too  really long and boring being there against your will 
I am so sorry to hear that. I have been devastated by the loss of pets in the past so I can understand what youre going through. Im sure she was very loved and had a great life with you and your family.
Aww thats great! What breed? 
Oh no! that sounds so scary. was everything ok?
Good Im glad to hear that.  Thats a long time.  Hospitals scare me I cant imagine being there for that long
Im so sorry to hear that! Hopefully he or she wasnt in too much pain at the end.
Oh my gosh thats horrible. I hope they caught the person who hit her!
oh man thats gross! at least it was vomit and not something else.
how many cats do have?
Aw I am so sorry. How long did you have your dog for?
They say dogs are mans best friend. 
What kind of dog was he?
Nice I have an australian shepherd. He follows me around everywhere. 
Oh no. Thats terrible. I lost my dad five years ago I know how terrible that feels.
Neither did we. He seemed so healthy and then within weeks he was so sick he couldnt even talk. I miss him every day
surprise gifts are always fun.
that sounds like a well deserved plan.
Oh man I can relate that feeling of anxiety before you get there really turns around when you get caught up in the moment
Life is full of experiences like that they seem scary from the outside but once you relax you get swept away
that sounds prettty bad!
I cannot imagine if something like that happens to me. I would be trying very hard to find it.
Sometimes by remembering all the places that you have been in the past two days can help. I will try that!
I agree completely it is an embarrassment to the parents you would think. 
The frustration they go through well at least we dont have to take the kids or parents home.
What store were you at? 
Could you get a rain check? That is a bummer? 
Aw man Im sorry to hear that. Is there anything I can do to make you feel better? 
Ice cream cake is my favorite! Im glad youre feeling better haha. You have a really nice coworker.
Thats really awesome! She sounds like a great person to work with.
Oh I know how that goes. My husband loves sweets but if it is just sitting there and no one is eating it It will get eaten right then. Getting another would depend on how much he likes sweets and needs them. lol
Thats probably what I would do also. It wont kill him to wait another day.
Oh I hate when that happens. we go to self checkout to avoid things like slow lines.
Hopefully the person learned what they had to do so they dont hold the line up in the future.
Oh man that must have hurt. Did she know you had feelings for her?
Sounds like your friend broke bro code that was kind of scummy.
Wow! What a nice friend. I wish my friends did that
Thats great. Its nice to have people so close to you. It really helps in bad times
That must of been a proud moment for you as a father.  Shes all grown up and out in the real world now
Thats awesome shell have a great time and learn a lot im sure!
Wow! What are you gonna do with the winnings?
Bills do take up a lot dont they.
Oh my gosh! thats funny.  was that the only thing that made you think it was haunted?
How did you discover exactly what it was?
Roller coasters are scary for me. How was it for you?
Im the same way haha. But how was it fun if you have your eyes closed the whole time?!
I am so sorry to hear that. Im sure she was very happy while she was alive with you guys.
You went through a lot of losses.
That sounds painful I hope you were okay after your fall. 
Yeah i bet that was really embarrassing but Im glad youre okay. 
Oh boy!  Thats always a nail biter waiting to hear back and it seems like they love to take the full amount of time before they let you know. Did you get it?!!
Amazing! Congratulation! Prayer is always a good thing to do! That is so incredible.  Are you enjoying the job?
I remember those times. Did you get what you wanted?
The super nintendo is a classic. What is your favorite game?
Oh no! Im so sorry!  I would feel the same way but you just have to think...who cares what others think!  If they cant have compassion for an accident then something is wrong with them.  Did you get hurt?
I bet they didnt.  I like to look at experiences as part of our journey and teaches us to have compassion for others in similar situations.  So glad youre alright! Hope you own a helmet!
Howd the hurricane go?
Thank goodness. Hurricanes are no joke.
Was he okay?
Well maybe if you do it a little more then he will be fine with it. I would be afraid just because he is afraid.
Maybe so. Its good he has a good home now.
I bet he is. Dont worry
That is a great idea
Saving money is important
Thats amazing! You must be so proud.
Shes also a hard worker.
That was very sweet they dont have to actually do that.
Good to know there is still kind people in the world.
Thats awesome! Who were they from?
That was really sweet of him maybe he just wanted you to know youre loved.
You can never be too prepared! I am sure you have got everything.
That was very smart thinking on your part. Have fun on your trip!
We all do things we regret when drinking
Thats usually how it goes
You definitely took a leap of faith there. Howd it go?
hahaha I definitely admire your courage to have done that.
I wish you luck
I am sure you will meet them
Thats disappointing. What happened? Did he just not do anything?
I would have been disappointed too. 
Oh no that is a total bummer. Its especially common in the summer months.
Oh right I spent some time in Florida when I was younger and I remember it being so unpredictable. Just gotta keep an umbrella all the time lol.
Cool. Was it interesting?
Good for her! Moms get a lot done lol
ARe you happy or sad?
I bet. I she moving school or a job?
Oh cool thats great! What were you doing that they recognised?
Awesome. What is your job?
Wow was it a scam or was it legit?
That is so good congratulations you are lucky what are you going to use it for?
Oh no! But that happens it has happened to me several times. At least you had the great workout!
Thats great. Are you excited?
Is it your dream job? Then you should really be happy.
Was it real?
Thats awesome. What are you going to buy?
Australia. I hope to go there some day
I bet I will get there one day
Ive done the same thing before. Im sure you werent a bother
Yeah and they really should be better about how they place their racks
That has happend to me too.
You can always sell them if you buy discs. Cant do anything with a download though
We live and we learn lol
I used to love that band
I have not either
Probably at 4 or 5! lol
No idea! I havent had cable in so long! I would HATE that and they always over charge! Dont they have a rule that theres no service fee if they are late?
Was it real because I get those every day lol
I could do so much with 120. Im jealous lol
oh no! what happened?
ah crisis averted! that could have been a lot worse
Was it good? I hate when your favorite place disappoints.
Thats great. Sundays are supposed to be breezy
Hm that sounds interesting. Im not really familiar with this kind of situation since Ive never had to rent a car. What exactly happened or what did that mean?
Oh so it was no big deal? At least you cared enough to stop someone and ask them about it. No harm no foul.
That sounds perfect
The dentist makes me a bit nervous
Well at least think about the fact that its a good thing to go to the dentist!
That is awful did the person who hit it leave a note or a call back number? 
You should ask the airport people if they have any security footage of the parking lot maybe they can track down the car.
What kind of food was there?
It is nice that you enjoyed it.
Oh man.  That would of startled me too.  What did you do after?
Well I can understand your nervousness.  I probably would be on guard as well
Oh that is tough.  It is hard when our pets pass away.
It is like losing a family member isnt it.  Well just think of all the good times and be thankful.
Thats great! I never really studied much so I could have done better on my tests
Oh yes. But I found that getting involved in clubs along with a major I liked actually allowed me to spend less time studying and more time learning for fun. Its a subtle but important diffeence
Judging by the  Im assuming you didnt get to join them?
I would be envious too.  Perhaps next time you can go somewhere and return the feeling D
I hope where ever you go you visit someplace amazing!
That is nice. Do you like a lot pizza?
You are lucky.
Were you worried about something? What was keeping you up?
Hopefully you had a lock on them you can never be too safe.
Dang really! Sounds like you have a boyfriend that likes to shower you with presents.
That means that he is always listening and paying attention to you!
I have never tried a cold shower? What is it like?
I bet it does wake you up right away. I guess I should try that sometime if I oversleep. lol !
wow that is very rude of her
No I have never dealt with a rude person like that that lives near me
I totally agree. That actually sounds really good rihgt now.
Sounds fun. Ill be ready. Hope were going to the beach thats closest to us!
 I will be expecting to see you there.
Having positive attitude always succeed. Keep it up.
Interesting.  What was the first thought that popped into your head when you witnessed this?
Is that a reference to the color of the hair the shape or something else?
How did it go? Thats an anxietyinducing but hopeful situation!
Congratulations! Enjoy the new gig! Good things happen to good people.
Being defeatist is never a good move. Honestly once youve got your foot in the door I think its all about personality. 
I would argue most good employers can diagnose incompetence from the first or second conversation. If they cant maybe they arent good employers.
Time does fly really fast. I just turned 30 and it feels like I was just a teenager yesterday!
Im sure it will. At least it gets us to enjoy life more and focus on the moment.
Yeah its like a small world.
I think it is merely a coincidence.
Indeed they can. Is there any specific moment that you would like to talk about?
Oh I see. I thought that some other bad things happening in your personal life are making you cry
I completely agree. We must have positive thoughts at all times. 
Our thoughts are were everything starts. Mindset is so important. 
Thats awesome!  What do they do?
That would be nice but its never good to dwell on things like that instead of looking toward the future.
That sucks. How fast were you driving?
I hate getting pulled over too. Especailly for something silly like being a couple of miles an hour over the speed limit
Oh man Im so sorry to hear that. Youre not a loser though! Just take one day at a time. If you relapsed yesterday just move on and do your best not to drink today and tomorrow
Dont be so hard on yourself. We are all humans we make mistakes. 
That is probably so annoying
That really sucks. How long will it be going on?
Wow.  Thats either really lucky or unlucky depending on what you want.  Are you wanting kids?
Well then congratulations!  I wish you the best of luck and enjoy this time! 
Oh man! That is why I watch movies at home. Its just more comfortable.
I have considered it myself but feel the same as you. Will you go back again? 
right i feel you but maybe it will be good to get it all out!! 
Is she doing okay now?
great I am very glad to hear she is getting better!
Well congrats then I am sure that is not easy
What caused that to happen?
Oh gosh hopefully it doesnt happen next time
What were the photos of?
It is good to have those and look at once in awhile
I am sorry to hear that what happened?
Did you try therapy at all or counseling?
I am sorry to hear that I hope things improve for you a ton!
Sometimes we believe is the things that happen to us ... they are many
I interpret the difficulties
the lack of humor
Oh goodness I am so sorry to hear that. Was it sudden?
That is awful and very sorry you had to go through that. I work at a cancer hospital so I cant imagine going through that with a loved one.
What kind of stuff is in there?
Oh okay I love going through my old stuff too it is really fun
I hope you both have tons of fun!
thats great! Im glad to hear that. we often take our health for granted.
im one of those people. Eat junk food even though i know its not good for me
Uh OH what happened
Oh no well mistakes do happen it will be behind you in a few days
Exactly good luck
Oh yeah? What kind of old stuff?
I always liked those old lunch boxes myself. Do you have a favorite?
Nice! I loved that show when I was a kid. I never had the lunch box though.
Oh OK!  WHere are you moving to?
Thats good!  That will make your life much easier!  Congratulations!
Thats exciting. Do you have a plan for a date for when she says yes?
What all is on the agenda for the date?
Great. Are you going to get it published?
What is the book about?
Boo. What genre?
OH NO that is the worst! Did you clean it up?
You shoudl write the date on stuff to prevent that from happening again
Ouch. I hope shes okay.
thats good its always a good feeling after
thats the way to do it
Did his team win?
Thats great news! I bet youre so proud.
Oh no!  Why are they driving you crazy?
That is no good!  I guess it is time for you to go shopping!
Storms are the worst and destroy so much.
My family went through a big storm a few years ago.
what happened on the phone call?
I am so sorry about that.
Has it made any scratch marks?
Have you tried disciplining him in anyway
Sounds like its time for a crate.
Yea I hate calling ATT or Verizon they take forever to get on the phone.
I think as we get smarter it will get better.
Wow!  Sounds like a keeper right there!  That must have been a nice surprise for you!
It is always nice when someone gets their priorities right!
Oh no!  That is horrible!  Is he OK?
That is really sad!  I hope it was quick and painless.  I hate seeing anything suffer!
Did you let him borrow it?
Thats good to hear. I assume everything went ok?
Awesome. Alls well that ends well.
Did you say yes?
Where does she plan to go?
Money problems are never fun. Trust me I know.
Yeah definitely. Have you tried asking for a raise?
Oh no Im so so sorry. Ive always had at least one pet throughout my life and theyre truly part of the family.
Yes theyre honestly more dear to me than my friends. I hope youre doing okay  Im sure your dog was very loved and had a wonderful life so try to take comfort in that.
That is great! Doing what?
I bet that is nice and probably has good benefits!
I can never go on long trips.
I can no longer afford them long trips cost the most.
Oh no!. Are you ok? Must not have been a bad one if you were laughing?
How ironic. I kind of wish I were there to see it.
I am bad at every game.
I still could not do that I am very weak human person.
Do what i did quit the job and live at home with mom.
I still thing living with a relative is the cheapest way to go.
Thats awful! Luckily I paid all mine off but I know many people still struggle with it
Yea...the education costs are atrocious and honestly not even worth it on my opinion. Its just the piece of paper. The material you learn from them can be learned online for free or nearly so
Typical of most companies.  Ask employees to do more and pay less.
What kind of job do you have?
Im sorry did anyone see?
I hope you would wear a belt next time.
That sounds like a blast.  Compared to my job LOL.  
Im sorry.  I like my job but its certainly not like hers!
LOL.  Be careful.. thats a ton of carbs.
What all did they do for you?
How long did it take for you to teach you dog that?
I thought I would take longer like months!
Oh no. Maybe you can get some things done around the house.
Lol That sounds like a plan. Working two jobs is hard.
Yummy... what did you eat?  I am hungry.
That sounds so good.  Like I love that stuff.
I am glad no one in your family is sick.
Thank goodness my family is healthy too.
But do they give raises more frequently and do they have better benefits. It may be worth it still
Benefits are worth a lot more than you think sometimes
is there a special reason?
going anywhere good?
that sounds fun
That is great. How have you done it?
That is a lot of walking. I can hardly walk 1 mile.
I have never been on a trip before.
I have long weeks every single day.
I would just quit and live off the government.
Everyone can! Just gotta try.
how sweet and thoughtful of you
You seem to be a very compassionate person very kindhearted.
Ohh I so sorry.
Hope you are doing better. Ill pray for you.
Good for you! stay healthy
Forget that! Eat pizza and enjoy life.
I agree I eat what I want when I want all the time.
You have to have fun!
Get drunk and go out!
I never go to the store anymore I wish i did.
Not for me i shop online mostly these days.
Just go for it! Never look back!
Best of luck my friend you can do anything.
I own an animal shelter here in my home town.
I try to pass that onto my top doctors to take care of the dogs.
Thats great! I hope she goes to a good graduate school.
Dont feel bad now. Whats done is done
I can understand. I am really sorry
That is so sad. I hope they recover okay. Hopefully you werent in trouble for being late either.
That is awesome are they coming to visit you?
Awesome! Im not a father yet but I can only imagine your kids growing up and leaving to live their own lives.
Aw Im sorry did you just forget or you were thinking about other things?
Yeah had a similar scuffle with my wife but being married sometimes you just have to forgive and forget.
I have never liked spiders.
You should always have bug spray on you at all times.
That is really scary. Are you home alone?
Im sure you are fine. I bet it is just a tree branch or something like that. Maybe a neighbor could go look for you.
YAY a promotion is always amazing.  when do you start?
Thats amazing financial stability can be a life changer.
Maybe theyre very eager to go a certain item.
True because regretfully I act that way sometimes too.
Yeah I hear you! Do you like to read or watch TV?
I like to do both as well. TV if Im feeling lazy reading if I feel more ambitious. 
Oh no!! How did you dry them?
Oh that sounds awful! But at least no one stole anything from your car.
Did you take it back that is so disgusting. 
I wouldnt want another either it takes one time for me to find hair bug etc and I am done with the restaurant.  
Best way to ensure your food is clean and free of hair cook it yourself.
That sounds great! I really pays off to be prepared. 
That sounds like some efficient planning! I hope you enjoy your trip!
I can understand you. But this is the cycle of life right? Kids grow and they have to find their own way of life in this world
Good for you. You can also call your friends to hang out if you have close ones
Oh no Im sorry. Did you stay long?
Maybe she was around but it wasnt time for the ball yet.
Thats wonderful. Hell be so excited when he finds out!
I hope you guys have a great time. Just the two of you.
Concerts can be a lot of fun! Will you be going to another one?
Ive never been to a Beyonce concert. Always sold out! Im glad you got to see her.
Congratulations! Good to hear your hard work is paying off.
You should definitely be proud of yourself. Pat yourself on the back.
Yeah I hope you get it! Im sure they will recognize the extra time youve been doing.
Wow I hope youre getting paid for all that extra time!
Sorry to hear that my friend.. Was she facing an emergency?
I know it sucks but i think you should have an open conversation to your girl about this
That is a tragedy! Where do you think you left it? Did you check your pockets?
Interesting. I hope you do find it. I dont know how you brush your hair.
I am so sorry to hear youre going through this. Hopefully its nothing.
Oh so you always prepare well huh?
I always wanted that level of discipline. good for you 
Congratulations! boy or girl
well as long as its a happy healthy baby you guys will be fine
Yep. Happy and healthy is a blessing
Whats the band?
Wow. That must suck. Do you like the band incubus? I missed them a couple of times but I saw them this year
yes. I wish I could send you a clip of it from the concert. It was awesome. Maybe you could catch def leppard next time. 
Oh such great nostalgia. 
oof that sucks.
yea you shouldnt be
well hopefully you find a better path in life
Oh wow i did not even know about the transfer. I bet Laker fans are delighted
So true. I might become a lakers fan myself at this point
That really sucks. Have you tried taking some melatonin?
Yeah it works wonders for me when I cant sleep.
Oh god.. so sorry to hear that.. May i ask how did Tom pass?
I can feel your emotions. Find peace in knowing that Tom is at a better place now
Why are you so thankful? Is it Thanksgiving?
Thats great to hear. Its always good to have a great family support structure when times are hard.
Oh no that is a terrible thing to do.
I applaud your response.
Oh no!!!  Did it smell bad?
Ewwwww!  Hope the cat is okay!
Sounds exciting.  I wish you the best of luck!
Dont worry everyone is nervous on the first day.
thats an awful thing to do! what did you do?
i am so glad that you did 
oh no.. what happened? did you face a financial loss?
so sorry to hear that.. hopefully things work out for you real soon
Great! Dont be nervous be confident.  Works like a charm.
Dont be. Just visualize yourself already having the job.
That is no good dude
You should. and get new friend
You did! Thats so cool!
Any free money is great.
Oh that sounds exciting! when do you go?
A new start and a new life that is exciting! I hope you love it.
mine too.. the nature is so peaceful and beautiful during the fall
i have been there it is so lovely. you are going to love it
Ewww. I would have been too
Did anyone video it?
Aw thats awful how old was it?
I hope youre holding up then I would be devastated if my pet died.
yea thank god he didnt go to the GSW
yea i bet they are
you have eyes too
Have eyes for someone else
oh yea i know how that feels
it really does suck
that movie scared me to death and i usually dont scare very easy.
oh my lord!!! how did you sleep that night?
Oh no!  What happened
Okay good.  I think everything is going to be okay!  Keep your head up friend!
Was she really sick?
Eggplant is gross but hey now you know! lol
I cant either!  I tried it once and Im like you......NO MORE!
Thats so messed up! Why was he doing that?
Good to hear how old was he?
ME too. Marvel movies are the best. Im late I just saw wonderwomAN
OH my word. I feel like I should watch them all over
is he sick?
Does he has any record with heart problems?
oh wow that really sucks
dang that is rough
Thats so sad! Did he at least die of old age?
Im so sorry to hear that may he rest in peace.
Is that because you just like being organized?
That is really a good way to be. I need to practice this more myself!
Bed is always a source of comfort for me. Especially after work when I feel so drained and stressed out
Indeed. Particularly when i grab my phone and watch short clips from my favorite TV shows on Youtube
aw Im sorry to hear.  Did you conquer your loneliness?
Im glad you were able to adjust.  It can be lonely without family around.
oh no.. why are you feeling that way?
That sucks.. Are you having trouble falling asleep?
How did that go exactly?
She is the most beautiful girl I have ever seen.
i dont blame you! i would have also!
nasty! did you tell him anything?
Oh wow! I am so sorry that happened to you.
I would have called the cops on her!
That must have been a very big man.
thats so nice love when that happens
that nice good for you
oh yea whys that?
oh that makes a lot of sense
What do you plan on doing today?
I want some of whatever you had for breakfast. You seem very happy.
Sorry to hear that! Why do you think that might happen?
Hopefully that doesnt happen and you have job security.
Thats pretty embarrassing haha. Ever find out what it was?
That would make sense though you could probably have smelt it if it was coffee.
Oh damn thats so sad. Was it salvageable? 
It definitely sounds that way gonna upgrade it?
oh yea i had those out 2 years ago it sucks
yea it can be sore and you cant eat anything
im glad i still have mine around.
exactly what i do. we were never close growig up. we are now.
Wow what is chiller theatre? Im intrigued.
Must be fun but unnerving as well. Whats your favourite horror movie?
Your best friends?
really what kind of sweets did you eat?
I love cookies especially oreos they are my favorite
That is nice to have good memories.
Did you go with your cousins?
I was too
No I dont get any golden opportunity. did you  ? 
Dont worry. Earn for it and go!! 
Oh no. Floodwaters can be devastating. Was there a lot of damage?
Good thing you were prepared.
Did yall make up
That is not good
Will you get to make it up?
I am sure you will find time
Oh wow how did he do
That is so cool
That sounds like something that could really show off your talents.
Thats great! Hope your hard work pays off.
How expensive is that to go to?
That is not too bad if you had a good time though
The loss of a pet is heartbreaking. I know how you feel. How old was Trevor.
Life is hard. But remember he didnt die he went to his forever home.
Sorry to hear that.  Have you since been able to overcome your loneliness?
I understand feeling like a duck out of the pond.  Glad to hear youve made progress.
Dont feel nervous you need to be confident!
Its hard to push that feeling away sometimes I know.
Thats exciting! Im guessing youre a Lakers fan?
What team was he on before?
I understand that I will pray for you
That makes sense I wish you both the best of luck and health!
Wow great job so far kep up the great parenting!
Wasnt that out a long time ago? It mustve been super scary if you still remember it.
Wow I wouldnt have been brave enough to do that!
Yes it is hard to see people with things you cant afford to buy for yourself.
Yes I like the color red as well. I have actually own a couple red sports cars.
It is great to be thorough and prepared. Are you expecting to perform well?
Thats nice i wish you the very best for your results!
I can see why! Thats highly inappropriate.  
You should. He is obviously at the very least flirting with you and at worst harassing you
Oh wow that is going to be such a sweet experience!
That is very true. I sincerely wish you both to have a wonderful time!
Im so sorry to hear that. Do you have things of hers that remind you of her often? 
That is beautiful that you have those things of hers. Mothers are very special people.
I have been to that it is such a wonderful experience. You are going to love it!
You seem to have a great taste in spending your free time. I wish you get to have a splendid time in there!
Im sorry to hear about that. How did he die?
yeah I bet. Im sorry for your loss
How did you hurt your back?
Ohh wow! I hope it gets better for you
Did you ask him to replace it?
I agree with you there I would ask him to pay honestly
Thats nice. How  do you like the dog?
That is so sweet. My apartments dont allow pets
That is for sure especially a smell that just throws you back
Exactly sometimes I just smell a good barbeque and that brings me back to those summer days as a kid life is great sometimes
That stinks. Im sorry to hear that
I bet! It seems like fun
Congratulations. Fun plans?
Awww. Im jealous lol
Awww. Did you keep it?
Thats great. I know he appreciates it
Thats great. I hope you do well!
how old was it
they live that long ? interesting
Well congratulations! That must have been nervewracking.
That stinks. Maybe he is going through something that only new stuff can solve
Do it! I bet you deserve it
Did you make special arrangements so things went smoothly with one car?
Well I am glad it worked out
What did you find?!
Oh no are you going to talk to him about the dangers of drugs?
Remind me which show was that?
Thats so cool!  Im gonna have to check it out
Thats nice. Are you going to hang it up?
Great youve found an old treasure.
Just try and get through each day one at a time. Dont think too far ahead.
That sounds scary.  Are you going to investigate?
If this were a movie Id be yelling at the screen for you to leave the house and not go down there.
I am so sorry to hear that.  Is he planning to retake the test?
Thats great. Is that your only son?
Im sure the memories will be great
Oh wow! Hopefully no one saw it
Im sorry about that. Ive gone through that before. Laughter can be good medicine sometimes
What is it called ?
Okay well I guess Im happy for you then.
Thats understandable.  How receptive was he to your complaint?
Oh so it got pretty serious.  I guess he needs to learn to respect boundaries.
Did you find anything?
I bet that was very nostalgic for you.
Thats a hard hit to take.  Why do you suspect they got it?
So what are you going to do about?  Are you going to start looking for another place to work?
What did you mess up?
Im sure youll be fine.  Have you made many similar mistakes in the past?
I wouldnt worry too much about it then.  Dont let it get you down.
Wow thats nice. I hope you treated yourself to something extravagant!
I guess they didnt do as good a job as they should have lol. Wish my car dealership had missed a few hundred bucks!
Well it was worth 500! Thats about what my cars worth these days  had it for years. Still runs great tho.
How fun! In a tent or an RV?
Dont forget a first aid kit! We always need those on camping trips!
Ugh thats so annoying.  How long did you have to follow behind them?
I hope you werent late for anything important!
memory lane right there! which cartoons? 
Very cool I havent seen the older style cartoons myself in years.
That would creep me out too what kind of calls?? 
Alright that would creep me out too. Block the number or change yours!! weird. 
Uh oh. Are you going to confront him about it?
Well I hope that he actually listens to you this time and gets help.
Congratulations thats awesome! I hope youre getting a raise too!
Hope you treat yourself to celebrate you deserve it!
That sounds amazing! When will you find out? 
You sound positive so I am sure you will get it!!! 
omg thats so scary! are you okay? did you call the police?
thats good to hear! people are crazy
I bet.  It is nice to have a day off every now and then
I like having days off to do absolutly nothing.  It helps with stress.
Thats the worst.  Is it damaging the curtains too much?
Is there anything you can put on them or near them to stop him?
That is great! Adopt dont shop! Always a great motto!
That is great I commend you!
Have you prepared enough for it?
Well Im sure you be fine. Just relax.
Thats good to hear! Have you been eating healthy?
Thats great! Keep up the good work!
thats strange my dog will eat anything lol
maybe he will start warming up to it soon
Thats awesome. Im glad she did well.
thats always a bummer when you put in such work and get nothing in return 
Oh I just quit a few weeks ago due to a similar situation actually! Never been happier! 
Did you study for it or are you winging it?
Dont worry then.  You did you part!! Im sure you will do fine!
Maybe you should try and have a party?
Yes being alone is not very fun.
What will your new age be?
You should have a great time congrats on the new age!
I went through a similar thing a few years back.  Everything seemed hollow to me.  How long has it been?
If your depressed speak to someone.  If its just adjusting to the change that comes in time.
Why is it that you are in trouble?
Can you just replace the document?
I would be reporting that to the police for sure. 
Thats true right.. i forgot how stupid the law can be sometimes. Thats insane. 
Oh no! I am so sorry to hear that. That must be very difficult for you and your family.
I am so sorry for your loss. I hope that you find peace in this difficult time.
Thats great. What will you be doing at your new job?
Sometimes being a manager is the worst job you can have at a place you seem to be the one who gets blamed for everything.
Aw man that sucks. Promotions usually arent given fairly in my experience. Was that the case for you too?
Ill keep my fingers crossed for you that you get that promotion next time!
That is amazingly lucky! good for you!
That is great! I wish I was lucky like that!
Awh poor baby.. I am sure itll get better now tho! How old is he? 
Ugh noooo! Thats terrible i am so sorry.  
I would be so excited! Did they pay you for it? 
Hopefully! that would be so amazing! 
That sounds like such a fun peaceful morning. So jealous you have a pool its been scorching outside!
Ah okay nice for the kiddos then. They grow up fast so hold onto these moments while you can
Aw well when your younger you dont do those things on purpose. I think everyone is mean to their siblings every now and then.
Have you talked to her about it? Maybe she doesnt really think about it anymore.
I am so sorry to hear about your loss. What did he get you?
That was very nice of him. Im glad you have a nice husband.
Well better to be sooner than later on something like that. Dont be hard on yourself. 
Thats so silly its none of his worry. He needs to hush up. lol 
Wow! He sounds like a super smart cat! How did you get him out of there?
Well at least you managed to save him!
Oh man Ive definitely had a few coworkers like that myself before. What does she even talk about?
Thats the worst! Some people once they get started they just cant stop themselves. Its like opening a can of Pringles.
Did it feel good to get it out?
Oh no thats awkward! Did you get in trouble for it?
Thats heartbreaking but youre amazing for doing that. Cats are my favorite and Ive rescued many animals. Its a lot of work.
Yes and when they love you it feels special because they dont love everyone like dogs do. Youve racked up a lot of good karma for saving them!
Im there too. Struggling each day. It really gets old.
Yeah thats right. Ive been pushing 70 hours working a week for as long as I can remember. Hold out maybe itll change.
You would be so suprised at how much stays all the way in the nooks and crannies of your brain when you take a break!
Im glad it paid off for you you must be super proud!
Oh no I am so sorry. What did you do?
That is tough. That must have been quite the trying time. Did you eventually find work?
Good how long has it been since you saw them last?
I hope you all have some fun.
Oh yes fall is definitely my favorite season as well! I love fall scents!
It is the best season by far! Plus Halloween!
Oh man those things are awful and reproduce like crazy.  We left our house for a week and came back to tons of them everywhere! The best trick is putting a little apple cider vinegar in a jar a drop of dish soap on top of that and cover it with cling wrap and put holes in it.  They will gravitate toward it and youll catch a bunch! Just keep changing it every few days.
Seriously gone is good.  They do have bacteria on them and lay their eggs on fruit and veggies and the larva burrow into the fruit or veggie so its good you trashed it all. Glad youre free of them!
That is so exciting! It can be stressful and expensive planning a wedding.
It really gets stressful when you get down to the last minute. You are always so worried you are going to forget something.
oh that was nice of them
haha thats pretty fun
Oh no I am sorry to hear that. I hope that he gets to feeling better. How old is he?
Oh I see I can understand your concern. Perhaps he will live longer than most hamsters!
That is awesome!  I would be really excited if I were in yyour shoes!
I hope you go far in your job!  Good luck!
That is quite upsetting. Do you know what ails it?
Well I certainly hope that the dog gets to feeling better. Are you close friends with this canine companion?
Oh no what happened? Hopefully the whole weekend didnt get ruined!
Poor little thing chicken pox are the worst. On the bright side you still got to spend your anniversary with your husband just not you know in the way you hoped. Hope you guys get to have a makeup weekend soon!
Wow thats nice.  What do you drive?
You have to think of the positives.  Just because they have a new car doesnt mean their life is great.  They could be watching you wishing they were fit and healthy like you are.
lol and some day you might you buy your own new Tesla if you feel like it!
yea i would be to
Nostalgia is a weird feeling.
Nice what do you have planned?
Sound great Im happy for you!
Wow!  That must feel great!  You should be proud of this accomplishment.  People can go their whole lives without ever being published!
Congratulations!  I wish I could be published.
What are some things you will bring?
Its a good idea to write thing down that you might forget.
What is wrong? Are you okay?
I am so sorry. I hope you get all the help you need.
We have been getting a lot of rain as well. I have to mow my lawn so much.
Yeah I know what you mean. I cant wait for the rainy season to end.
Oh my goodness Ive almost gotten hit while on a bike before and its terrifying. Im so glad youre alright!
Ditto. Its not hard to do and so many lives would be saved if people would just follow the rules. Ill send good vibes out so nothing bad happens to you in the future!
Wow congratulations! Have you guys set a date yet?
Oh I feel you I used to work in the wedding industry. Its crazy how much it costs even for the most basic wedding.
I know exactly how that happens. Sometimes the food is just too good to pass up.
Well I say go for it. It is only your birthday once a year. The other 364 days can make up for it.
Glad to hear you are having a good day. Wish every day was like that.
That is true. It puts things in context.
That is really awesome! That is so important to be involved in his life like that. 
It does! Kids can understand things about the bible that most adults overlook. 
that is frustrating especially if the weather isnt ideal 
that is unfortunate im sorry that happened!
That isnt good. Are you mad at your friend?
Are you going to get another cat?
I feel the same way as well!  I get really excited thinking about decorating and giving gifts!
I agree!  Everything that surrounds Christmas makes me smile and feel content.  It makes me thankful for everything good in life!
Thats a great outlook I think. We often lose focus of that very important fact.
Thats inspiring to me. I will try to think more like that as well whenever I get stressed in life.
8 Miles!? Thats very impressive.  I bet I could barely make it a mile!
Have you been a long time runner before that?
I can relate to that!  Yeah my wife with my credit card lol!
Haha I can understand the hesitation then.  But was the vacation at least worth the money?
Oh wow an additional 40K is a lot! Id be willing to put up with quite a bit for a pay increase that large.
Oh wow. Ill be honest and say it wouldnt be worth it for me! Whats an extra 40K if youre never not at work to enjoy it?
Oh wow I think itd take me much longer to not bust my butt! That is impressive!
Maybe shes more athletic than you think! She might be better than you soon. Better watch out!
oh man those are super nice! all electric is pretty neat
Thats good on his part how do you feel about it?
Thats awesome and I agree the job market is tough now a days.  High paying or not.
Oh thats no good. Any special reason why they were late?
Thats a bad attitude to have. I hope he can straighten up a bit if we wants to keep working there.
It will be okay. Its always hard making that step but its good for your health to do it.
I wish my insurance would give me something like that! Its good to go anyways.
Have you studied for it?  Always helps to prepare!
Good luck Im sure you will do fine!
Hey everyone trips up a little. What you need to remember is that you and your wife made a commitment and you should follow through on that. 
Its ok to have a cheat day everyone once in a while but you cant give in. Be strong!
You only get to do it once?
Oh no. I hope it goes well for you. Thats a lot of hard work.
Was it more than expected?
That has happened to me but with texts though lol
Did you apologize?
whats wrong with it?
can you fix it?
That is great news. Have you also been working out?
Has it been easy or hard to do that?
did they notice it was missing?
well at least you are attempting to be honest about it.
Ohh wow! Are you excited?
Ohh that stinks. I dont blame you though
Thats very creepy did he say anything to you?
Those are definitely the scary types they dont recognize social cues at all.
Ouch!  Did she hurt it or is it a degenerative thing? I hope she can find help with physical therapy.
Oh good.  Hopefully shell try to fix it with physical therapy first.  Some doctors love to do surgery right away when its not necessary.  Recommend that she get a second opinion.  Hope she resolves it!
Ive never understood that its not like they cant afford to eat since they have a job! Do you know which coworker it was?
Next time bring your lunch in a biohazard bag maybe they will leave it alone.
You definitely cant be too careful these days
how do you know no one goes in if you arent in there?
Oh no! That stinks. Ive never had a cat specifically because Ive never been good with the idea of being able to train them. Plus it seems like you just get the one personality and they never grow to like you. But Im biased.
Yeah I know they definitely suit some people. I actually now technically have one... my roommate wanted to get one and I felt too bad to say no. And he actually is a pretty nice guy mostly because hes been affectionate from the start. So well see how it goes! Sorry again about your mat.
Wow good for you! I hope that it works out for you!
Yeah and I bet the higher paycheck will make the work worth it. 
What! First of all are you alright?
Oh well thats something at least. I cant believe people are such cowards though.
Thats great. Do they know?
Well that is awesome. I bet they wont let you down in the new positions either
I have never run a marathon
You can try your best and if you dont finish there is always the next one
Well thats some sort of motivation lol
Congratulations!  What are you getting your PhD in?
Oh geeze I didnt know I was talking to a genius.  How long is the program?
Have you tried to talk to your teacher?
What school is this you are talking about?
Thats pretty cool that youre motivated and excited to start it. Most people would be scared and procrastinating. Youll do great.
Sounds like you have a plan laid out. It also sounds like youve already accomplished so much.. You should be very proud. Im with you I have over 40000 in student loans. Such a crazy pressure on someone right when they graduate. Good luck!
I can understand that.
You must love him very much thats good.
Aw it takes time! Making friends isnt always so easy so give it a little bit of time
The best thing to do is join clubs and get involved. You generally make friends by association!
that is really nice of you to do not a lot of people help others like that anymore
same with me if i ever see someone that could use my help i will most likely bring it to you
Ah dang... Sorry that happened to you. It stinks too because a lot of the time that stuff is just decided by who is liked more or who has better connections and not actual merit. If youre good Im sure you will get recognized at some point.
Well keep a good attitude. If you like the work and the job hopefully that will be enough.
Thats very sad to hear im sorry that happened to you 
I would suggest moving on time heals all wounds
Did she say thank you?
What a lovely woman and youre lovely too!
That sounds like a good idea. I hope you solve the problem quickly!
Yeah those were better times. Brings back good memories.
Well maybe yours. Mine just want to sit inside and play on their phones all day.
Oh man..I have had those too..and where I am the one getting crap even though I do my job and everyone elses..I HATE sitting around at work...I either want to work or go home. I hope your boss knows your coworker is lazy?
I AGREE and frankly if your boss does not see this and doesnt give you praise then I would quit as well or contact human resources! This kind of stuff is not acceptable.
sounds like you ate a delicious dessert what did you eat?
that sounds delicious i love chocolate cake i think that would be my favorite dessert
O? Thats a brave and noble decision.
Thats hard but great of you to do good luck.
Where will you be shopping?
Nice! Do you have anything in specific you want to buy?
hahah it whas happened to me it the worst thing
did you still eat it? or did you throw it away
Thats nice of them! People stopped doing that for me once I got older. I miss them
Well Im happy for you  It shows that they care
Thats horrible! Im so sorry to hear that.  Why would she do that?
It depends if you love her you could try to work it out.  Or you could cheat on her too
O yea? I
Im trying to teach mine tricks myself I think thats fun to watch!
Ive cheated on occasion. Its never right but its easy. At least youre ashamed of it.
Thats your decision to make but I think it would at least put you in control of the situation.
That sounds fun. Is it a special occasion?
I understand. Sticking with what you know seems safer.
you must be loving it
true that you cant be too sure until you use it
Tough week ahead. Do you think you have met your expectations thus far?
Sounds good. Your supervisor must proud of your work and your displayed high selfesteem
Oh no! That has so happened to me before! It was only by a couple dollars a month but I SO needed those couple of dollars at the time. I would be MAAADDD
Call the bank and get it fixed ASAP! Thats got to be so annoying for you!
I buy those like twice a year and never win.
Wow! Thats awesome! What did you do with it?
Hey why not? Its unexpected money!
Yeah I feel like you get lucky once then its all downhill from there.
Where was she?
Does she have a new ex now?
I would not put up with it either 
i love when the rain his the soil in the open field  the smell of wet dirt is just refreshing
I bet you are. What are you going to do? 
sounds like a real good time i hope you enjoy it 
Why is that 
You will be alright buddy
What have you done this year if you dont mind me asking?
That is great well there is still time to go this year!
I love it when its nice out. Are you going to do something outside?
That sounds great. A nice long walk in perfect weather. Theres hardly anything better.
Are you excited for him or jealous? lol 
I feel you! I know its hard having siblings sometimes! Go buy a toy car and park it on top of his. 
Can you report the caller?
Be sure to do it otherwise they could keep harassing you
What class is it for?
I never took chemistry. Do you feel prepared for the test?
Thats great.  Have they always been as supportive as they are now
nice.  what do you do for a living
Have you thought about spraying your garden?
Perhaps there is an all natural remedy you could try
Same here Im in Texas.  Where are you located
Nice! I used to live in St. Paul MN.  Weathers like a tundra which is why Im down here
Were you able to get inside fast?
Oh wow! That would be annoying!
How did they get off work midweek?
That would be nice but not fun that you dont have the same days off.
where is your favorite place to go?
i can imagine i hope you have a great time this year
I remember when my first child started I was a nervous wreck.
So they dont even have teachers yet? Wow thats crazy.
Have you tried getting out and meeting new people?
What about online friends?
that would hurt my feelings. are you alright?
i totally understand that. im sorry.
That sucks! Did you have a spare on you?
Thats understandable. What kind of project was it? Were you involved?
Thats so generous of you. Its people like you that make the work week bearable!
Thats okay Im 25 and still in college. How did it go for you? 
Thats awesome. Im glad it worked out well for you. 
Oh wow. I would have been so scared. more of a stranger than the storm
Well that was nice. How long were you stuck there
Did the ads bring up good memories I hope?
I have absolutely no idea what Boglins are but Im sure they were awesome!
Sounds frightening! Was this off the coast of a beach or something?
That is one of my greatest fears. Did you have to swim sideways from the current to escape?
Great to hear that you made it out ok!
Well I can understand that. Its very hard to be on a very strict diet without a break here and now!
Well i am sure you are disappointed but all you can do now is just get back on the diet again and try to be more dedicated. Its hard I know!
Is this a career change?
Oh hey Im a nursing graduate! Itll be difficult at first but youll get the hang of it.
Aw that sucks. Did you give her a proper burial?
Awwww I am so sorry. Have you thought about getting a new pup?
Yea a new job is useless pretty stressful.
It will be ok in the end.
Oh that is a real bummer. Were you hurt?
Ok glad you did not get injured. I hope your car gets fixed.
Well thats good. You never know what to say in that situation
I wish yo the best
That must of been fun to go through.
That is cool. Is your mother still alive?
Really? Did you manage to cope?
And was there?
you ever ever plan to get another ?
Really how did they do it?
Amazing! Well done to him.
Well done at least you will sit in your room excited and relaxed now
Heat wave is getting so terrible theses days. I even watched on CNN that the whole of New South Wales is experiencing a drought so sad
That sounds unfortunate. You must have been so annoyed with him!
People like that should just do shopping online instead of ruining the experience for everyone else!
Do you have daughters of your own?
yea traffic sucks
well yea thats true
Same here. It reminds me of my childhood for some reason.
Exactly i am overcome with nostalgia and get tears of joy sometimes. 
I bet! Did it turn out nice?
Thats good... I cant wait for my vacation!
Thats terrible! Did the dog survive?
Maybe someone should train the kid to be stronger... by beating him up!
What I do is to write all the good things I did within the week I think you should do the same
i agree with you buddy
You must have prepared really well. Did the trip go well?
Sounds like the trip went well. I am glad you enjoyed it!
all the time
its just life
Nice what breed is the puppy?
I have never heard of such a breed. Must be so cute! 
i do that all the time. i live on the mexican border. what border did you cross?
glade all was well
Cool! How did it go?
Great! I hope you get the job. Ill be rooting for you!
He sounds pretty strong. Any reason in particular that he did that?
No kidding. Definitely some quality entertainment for dinner time!
I hope you both have a great time!
oh how does it go
its ok you tried your best 
Well that is great and sad all at the same time. How far away did she move?
Aw well that is normal. Im sure she didnt want to leave. Every day will get a little easier.
Oh my goodness that sounds terrifying.
Im glad that you are okay.
i bet that was quite the blast from the past
yes they do. mine are already out of college
Oh are you going on a trip?
That sounds like a fun time.
I am so happy for you! Congrats!
Oh no! Im so sorry! Its so difficult to lose a pet.
I hope in time you are able to feel better.... and that your heart will be filled with happy memories.
Thats awesome! Happy belated birthday! What did she get you?
Sweet! I really like Ducatis they are beautiful bikes.
Did it rain a lot?
That must be really scary to go through.
That sounds like fun! What happened?
Yeah I understand that. I dont let anyone drive my car either. I hope everything worked out okay!
That seems like it would be a little awkward to me..
Well they sound like they are actually just a nice person trying to help you out that is really nice.
Thats always a nice find.
I bet it was! I love looking at photo albums
That is nice. Did you start playing guitar with him?
I am also working from home from time to time. I could feel some time lonely.
I usually get out after finishing work to feel less lonely.
Oh that must have been so embarrassing. 
Im sorry it happens to us at times.
Congratulations! That is so cool!
I hope you have fun with that money.
I cant believe your coworker would do that to you! Did your manager listen?
I wouldnt be either. Are you going to try to talk to your coworker about it?
OH wow! I bet you all had a blast!!
They will really appreciate that when they are older and look back on it. 
oh god what do you do at that time
how did you feel at that time
Oh wow! Are the babies ok?
Good thinking. Im sure the parent bunnies appreciated that.
Oh man. What a bummer!  I love cucumbers and hummus!  Do you have anything else youre growing that survived?
Oh good Im glad the entire garden didnt get ruined.  I would love to plant a garden one day soon since I went vegan plant based about 3 months ago.  Happy tomato eating to you!
Oh what a mess. I would hope that they picked it up.
Well at least they cleaned up after. I would have been more annoyed if they didnt.
Could you tell me what you have done?
That sounds great I hope you succeed.
Thats great news! Congrats! My garden is not doing great this year. Do you grow anything else?
Yum. I wish I had a green thumb. 
Thats awesome It is very hot where I live so I am jealous!
Well Im glad you get to enjoy some nice weather for a change!
where exactly are you cos it rained all through in my area?
ok im at the south east
ohh wow! Thats not cool
I wish people would take responsibilities for their own actions
Oh man! Hopefully nothing broke! 
At least it sounds like you recovered everything! 
He accused me of stealing from him
Sorry that was an error! Any way over to your conversation.Who did you cut off that made you feel bad?
Yea I hear ya. Im stuck here at work for another day too.
I just hope it doesnt rain this weekend.
What is the test on? Have you prepared for it? I bet you will do better than you think!
Good for you! I bet you will do amazing. Best of luck!
i feel the same one and lately it seems to be getting worse. ive never been brave enough to go eat alone.
i get that. i work all day then come home to the same routine everyday.
Me too! Im stuck inside at work and hearing about how great it is out there.
Haha same! Just one more hour for me. Hope you can enjoy it soon!
That is not good what happened
That is never a good thing I hope they land on their feet
Oh well that is a nice surprise though!
That is nasty how do they get away with that?
Exactly I would report them so nasty
I hope so too get it checked out!
Sorry to hear that. It would really upset me to be in that situation!
I hope you win that one! Good luck!
I am sorry for your loss at least you got some time together
I feel that way about my grandma it is sad that by the time we are born they are so old
I think lyft is better
oh I am sorry to hear that why did they move away?
They sounds very complicated
That is nice to have
having friends over is always nice!
i bet. hope you all have a fantastic time!
Are you guys in good relations?
did it bring back a lot of old mermories?
thats good that you have progressed
She is a crappy person flirting with someone who is in a relationship. Good on you stand up guy
Lol Well poor you. I have always had guys doing the same and it means nothing to me. If I am in a relationship..or heck even when I am not..I dont get interested in random people generally. I have to know who someone is..Remember that what lasts is WHO someone is...Someone you want to grow old with..Bodies wont last.
That must of been weird. Who was it?
Was it suppose to scare you?
Well I hope it lasts forever
Thats good! I guess you studied a lot?
Thats good. I am sure you will do great on it.
Ouch that sounds pretty gross!
Id avoid that taxi driver again if you have the chance.
I hope it was maybe the weight of the muscle that the scale was picking up.
Yes dont let that stop you. Also pay attention to what you eat as well. Its even more important than the exercise portion.
I dont know whether thats a good or bad thing. Which is it?
Thats great! Its definitely a good thing when you can be yourself.
What was it I wonder?
It mustve been nasty like puke
I like that philosophy. Here lately has it been easier or harder to stay positive?
I like that how long have you felt this way about life?
wow its good to warm
it is easier to walk around when its sunny also
What exactly did he do
Yes some people have to stay away form law enforcement jobs.
Wow! I bet you two are very excited! 
That is wonderful. Our first vacation after getting married was full of fun sun and adventure. Those are the best! 
You sound very confident. Thats good
I know what you mean. Just believe in yourself
Is he being too noisy?
I see how that can be annoying have you asked him to stop doing that?
You werent excited about it?
I understand. Stress is a definite mood killer
ive always wanted to have the eye surgery. im ready to get rid of my glasses and contacts
im glad you feel happy about it
Its good to believe in good things.
Yes I like your attitude. 
its true theres nothing like the good old days
im glad you were one of them!
I know how you feel. Do you have a big trip planned once you receive your passport?
I hope you enjoy your adventures!
I hear you. I had the same experience after just 5 years
I understand. She took my daughter with her
What subject are you trying to pass?
I love math good luck with your exams than.
why were you acting like that?
im glad you were in a good mood.
Did they say or do anything specifically to you that made you feel that way?
I understand how that can make you feel a certain way. Unfortunately there are those types of people around every corner.
Oh Wow! 20 years at your job! You must be well liked there. 
It must have been a wonderful surprise for you.
Oh my goodness what was the terrible news?
I am so sorry I hope your brother ended up being okay.
Dang thats not good. What did you end up doing??
Oh wow. Did the police get called? I hope you didnt get in trouble. 
Yeah? What is changing?
Brilliant. here are you going?
Amazing! and Exotic
Thats so generous of you. The world could use more people like you.
Caring for both the young and the old. Any hospital would be lucky to have you on staff!
Oh my how did she react?
Ha! Do you feel bad about it?
It certainly can. What type of job are you looking for?
Maybe they had lots of other candidates to see
I know that feeling. Something will come through though
Yes! I feel like the day escaped me. Have you done that recently?
It is Friday that would be a nice way to start the weekend!
Ugh I can imagine. But your time will come be patient!
Have you tried yoga? It can help in the meanwhile till you get a proper vacation.
Oh no! Did you get the surgery?
But you have recovered now. Right?
Are you pregnant? 
Congratulations! Thats brilliant news
Good job! Do you feel proud of yourself?
Hard work always pays off! Keep it up.
Man! Thats pretty bad.
i hope it goes well for her
Awesome! Glad that you did well on the exam!
Now you can celebrate this exam result! Always feels good to accomplish something like this.
oh wow. that is some scary stuff!! what happend?
did they catch the person?
You shouldnt like to your mom. I think you should tell her the truth about what really happened.
That sounds like a great idea!
Oh no! You have to have a tough mentality when you do that as it can be rough to have people see you fail
Thats good! Practice makes perfect and if everyone stopped when they failed we would not have as much as we do today
Thats terrible. Did you let others know that you had completed the job?
I could imagine. Some people stoop low to take credit for what others do.
what kind of surgery was it?
Thats awesome! Its great to have friends their for someone.
Oh no! Did you scold him?
Id be angry too but its hard to get mad at doggos.
Congrats to you!  What kind of nurse are you looking to be?
I have no doubt that you will be a great RN!
That is awesome what is his secret?
Being debt free can be a great feeling
Im sorry to hear that. Does she have a job now?
Well that was nice of your boss. Its great to have good people in this world
I hope this is the true love for you
You got this just be yourself and professional obviously and dont over think it. 
You will get it happy thoughts only and if not something better is in store. 
It sounds like you are a great parent.  Does she appreciate all the help you give?
She will definitely appreciate it when she gets older too.  I still remember my dad helping me with math homework and cant thank him enough for the help he gave me throughout the years.
Im sorry about that. How did you find out?
That stinks. Are you still with her or did you leave her?
Whoa that is really cool. Did you train him to do that?
That is amazing. Must be a very smart dog.
I understand! As we get older its hard to do it all everyday!
It happens but definitely be honest as you would want someone to be honest with you
Oh no are you able to afford the repair for it?
What a great friend you have. Definitly get him a gift when you are done.
I hope you can too. How is it going?
Thats great! I have faith that you can do it.
Thats really good! Do you think youre ever going to use the card again?
That is wise. I too am trying to pay off my credit card debts. After that Im cutting them up.
That would have really scared me.
I bet you are thankful that your friend was there.
All of it??? Oh no. How bad do you feel right now?
Haha I bet. Im sure they were looking forward to it.
Why would it be in the house to begin with? does the dog poop in the house?
You are having trouble with family ?
Mine isnt either. Are you married?
Awesome! What are you going to see?
Whatever it is I hope you have a good time!
Oh no!  Howd you do that?
What were you doing on the roof?
Did you catch anything?
Did you at least have fun?
congrats! you must be proud!
My daughter is only in eigth grade we have a while to go
That is good to feel that way. You dont want to feel like someone close to you would let you down. Did it work out for you?
Oh I am sorry. That is sad. Remember that it is not your fault. I would think of the people who have been there for you. 
Oh gosh you also scared of bugs?? Thats my worst fear
I would have a heart attack! 
I have no idea what those are!
oh ok. I like ravioli is it like that?
What are pierogies? a type of food?
Ah nice I love dumplings what are in them?
Thats no good did you throw it out?
Hope you dont get sick!  That would be a bad start to the weekend.
Oh I am so sorry. It has to be the most difficult thing to have to do. I had to do that with my gorgeous lab  I still miss him!
Indeed they are. And so are many cats  the farm I used to live on has a ginger tom. Hes quite the character and used to visit me regularly!
This fella is called Oliver. Hes a big old softie who is ace at catching gophers. He would bring half eaten ones to my door!
Oh I shouldnt be ungrateful lol! At least he kills them before delivering them. A friends cat used to deliver live mice into the bathtub!
Did you get a promotion?
Wow great job!
Oh no!  What has you scared?
Itll be okay I promise.  First few days will be weird but youll slip in no problem once you adjust to your schedule.
oh dang thats so horrible
it gets better with time but it must be hard
I remember that store! I loved going shopping there was it your first job?
Yeah I bet it looked like a fun place to work.  Especially for a college job.
Are you having any specific problem areas?
Okay. I hope you do well too.
Interesting those things are huge Do they even make them any more?
Do you have a large family or do you just like the idea of a large SUV?
5 is fairly large i would say. I hope you get your giant car one day.
It is a big change. What is scaring you?
I hate bugs too. You should exterminate before you move in
Is it really far?
oh no. im sorry to hear that
Well that would be terrifying! Were you afraid that a vampire was there?
Well that would be very creepy! They would hear my scream in the next town over!
You were ready? Thats good to hear.
Aweomse.  Treat yo self.gif
I bet. Good luck to you
Where you supposed to be there? If so then that is a nice feeling.
Oh I see. That could make the time go slow also. 
Thats great. What classes are you taking?
Thats pretty cool... Are you going to go towards hardware or stick with programming?
You should go all out and get a EE degree to go with it.  You can do microprocessor design.
Any time. Have a good weekend D
Did that happen tonight?
Well it mustve been something you said.
Did she have a party?
Does she have her license yet?
Well theres no hurry in driving is there? What does she do mostly on her phone? Text??
Does she play any sports?
Thats super frustrating! Ive only ever had outside pets so I cant really offer advice but its one of those things where your anger is all misplaced because you know you cant really be upset with the dog since it doesnt know any better.
Itll be well worth it when she gets the hang of it but urgh. Bathroom problems are why I dont think I want a kid anytime soon!
You got a present? How lovely! What was the occasion?
Well happy anniversary! What was your present?
I agree.. Did something happen?
Im sorry.. Not everyone is bad.  Just a lot of people.
That was nice
Do you have anything in mind?
So I take you left to live someplace else?
Just remember to never invite you exroomate to your new place EVER!!!!!!
Very nice congrats on making it that far. I actually was in the same situation about a week ago.  How do you feel you match up to the others?
I would be upset too.  However I wouldnt get discouraged though.  There may be another opportunity even better that comes along soon.
Thats great its good to see people finish what they start. You must be very proud.
Well hopefully there will be nothing but great things for him in his future.
I am so glad to hear that.  Did he find a job?
That is good to hear.  What will he be doing?
Oh thats wonderful! How long have you two been dating?
Its a huge step congratulations! 
Sometimes deaths affect us even when were not really close.
Guilt can be a terrible thing to live with.
Is he sick or just being lazy?
I hope he can get the help he needs and maybe a job he enjoys more.
Oh well thats awful on a little person! I never liked it when a teacher did that when a child needed to go to the bathroom!
LOL well thats good to know. So am I!
Is your patient improving an following good medical advice?
That would be a surprise.  A lot of people are not dedicated enough to change their condition especially those with diabetes.
Thats... uh... strange?
I think so youre two peas in a pod.
Pets are great but they can be a bit needy for attention at times. It is great but not when you are busy and trying to get things done.
A walk will definitely help. He will probably be ready for a nap when you get back then you can get some work done.
Oh my god! Thats terrible!
Oh thats so great!
Thats amazing!  Congratulations!  Swimming can be tough
LOL I bet you use that line all the time!  I love it
Oh man! I hope no one noticed. 
Im glad that it all worked out!
Oh I bet you are really torn.
Im sure he will love that. I bet you will see the joy just shining in his eyes.
Thats one of the hardest parts of life. What happened??
That is hard! Relationships are hard work.
That is great of them did you do anything to pay them back?
That is nice of you glad you have supportive friends!
Aw poor mouse. I have had a few before..We actually rescued a few from our cat  
They have live traps to catch and release that are only a couple bucks. Mice really are sweet natured.
What happened to them?
Good sorry you were inconvenienced hope things get more consistent!
that sounds like fun. for some reason kids really enjoy cooking.
that sounds like fun. i want to try to make mozzerella
Did you study for it at least?
That is true well best of luck to you friend!
That is bad. What did you do after that?
Did he say sorry?
is that the one with Bryce Dallas Howard?
Oh? What about them?
Thats true. Any memory in particular?
Is it really? How hot is it there?
That is hot but it is a bit hotter where I live here
Did you feel lonely or were you happy to have some time to yourelf?
That is tough when youre not used to being alone.  What did you end up doing?
Oh thats cool!  What do you all have planned?
Well that sounds like a fun little trip.
thats nice to be able to relax
everyday is a good day!
Really? You must really like you job then
Good for you! I hope you  have good week!
I am sure you will do fine! Good Luck!
Oh I am so sorry. Best thing to do is be there for her.
I have and it really hard. It just takes time But a good support system makes it way better.
how did she handle it
well that was nice of you
did it help?
congrats! i hope it works out
That was good of you.  He didnt hurt her did he?
Oh no!!! Where did you end up going?
That was so awesome of your mom 
That is terrible. Those days a lot of people do stupid things.
Children usually do really well they are versatile. 
I hope he continues to do well.
Are you excited or will it be lonely? 
Yeah that is scary. I am sure she will do great things though!
I bet it was really quiet and lonely. Did you find some time for yourself though?
I dont think I would like that quiet either.
Well thats not good. Im sorry to hear that. Do you think maybe you were just too nervous during the test?
Never be too confident! Youve got to give life your all at every step.
I agree. I dont know why they work in the service industry if they dont like to be nice
Fast food employees are the worst sometimes... its like we bother them
How exciting!!!  I bet you are thinking already about  how you want to decorate it and fix up the lawn etc..
I can imagine!  It is certainly an exciting time.  I bet you are just over the moon happy!
Any experience with what?
Yes some things
Are you trying to save money by not eating out at work?
Well it can save you a bunch of money!  Plus you gain the time that you would normally spend going out somewhere and you can use that time to have more of a break.
Oh my! I bet you was so disgusted that you ran out of there. 
Yikes! Why in the world would somebody do that?
Whoa! That is really scary! Ive felt weird sensations like that before.
No! Im sure you are not as monsterish as you think!
Aw thats nnice of her
Moms are the best
Did you kill the snake?
That is too bad will you ever camp again?
Did they do a good job?
Did you take them out for drinks after the meeting?
i would have loved to do the same
Did you resolve things?
I hope you can get over that pain.
Thats awesome! It would be amazing to win a million one day. One can dream.
Thats great. I hope you do! Maybe this time you can get 40. But gamble only in moderation!
That is really upsetting!
Well forget them! If they dont care about you you dont need to care about them
well that sounds pretty fun!
Were you satisfied with the results?
how did it go
oh well maybe next time
how many days has it been?
Drunk people can get pretty disgusting in general.
Some people cant hold their liquor.
I can imagine. What happend that you got your jaw wired?
Man that sounds aweful.
Nice.  Always feels good to be at the top knowing nothing cant touch you
I feel like everyone goes through that phase.  I know I did too
Would you say youre more of an introvert?
Especially in the south
Oh wow that does sound horrible
did you find out the results?
dang thats awesome!
Oh wow and you couldnt keep your job? What were you going to school for?
Oh wonderful! One of the best fields to be in right now
Wow! Good luck there are so many things you can do with that degree and from home too!
That is awesome. I never even get a second date A husband may not be in the cards lol
Thats sweet. I bet they enjoyed it
I hate bad traffic did you get in an accident?
Thats the worst I hate when people are careless.
that sucks. have you talked to her?
That is awful.  I agree.  A professional setting is supposed to be ... well professional.  What steps are being taken to correct that?
I agree.  I hope it will be.  Team building communication and professionalism will all help a company.  I think this is why so many companies fail.  
Wow you do really live far from your parents. Do you go to college or work?
I see. Well it seems as people get older they want to go back to places which reminds them of past. Nostalgia probably helps them cope with passing life
I can see how that would be a downer.  Will you still get to see them?
At least they arent gone completely but I can understand how that would affect your day to day work life.
i would be really annoyed myself why so many frequent calls ?
i know ever since i purchased a new car i know for a fact i did not read the fine print but insurance companys call me almost every day multiple times a day  its really annoying 
I know right! my parents love tennis so I grw up watching it.
were you ever any good at it?
Good for you to have such memorable experience to have and remember of. Can you bake now for real?
Are you still in contact with him?
Oh that sucks. I hate when that happens.
I bet the next house you look at will be amazing and even better than that one.
That sounds exhausting! Were you driving for work or just taking a vacation?
Im sure the drives worth it since you get to spend time with the family.
Was he alone?
Cool. Did you do something special?
Do you get a raise?
Probably they noticed some irregular or even fraudulent activities associated with your account
Are you interested in mortgage for now?
Oh that is really gross! Have you talked to her about it?
If you share the fridge Id let her know if it causes an odor or might affect the other food.
cool. did he have gifts?
Oh. I am lol
Like what? Bad or miserable?
Yes indeed. Seeing people less fortunate than me makes go to pieces
Wow. enjoy your own time.
Yeah youre right. Hope youve memorable vacation.
Waothats really not cool
He doesnt deserve youso wipe your tears
Thats sad. But Im sure they stil want to be firends with you too
Posibly. Sounds like you are better off without him though
Thats awesome I wish I could build my own house.
Well thank you as well.
Did she die recently?
Oh wow! Thats so sad I know animals can be like kids to use. Im so sorry
That can ruin a persons life.
That is such a mess.
Tell me more sounds exciting! 
Good on you! You finally got recognition for your hard work
What concert was it?
That probably would have been fun.
That sounds terrible. I hope youre okay now.
Well all the matters is that no one was hurt. You can buy property again but not lives.
That is so messed up!
I would be so angry.
Oh wow What kind of dog was it? Im so sorry that mustve been super hard
I can imagine. I havent had an animal die yet but my cat is 13 and Im dreading the day
Thats wonderful that you are pursuing a degree. What is it in?
That is great that you have been able to overcome and do this to help others. You can really make a difference! 
Yeah? Which game was it for?
Nice. The original Spyro is a classic.
Oh no. What did you do?
Lol well done for attempting it. Did you make it to work on time?
Thats great. What made it so special this year?
Sounds like fun! Im glad you had a happy birthday.
I wish you nothing but the best!
It sounds like youre talking about two different people there instead of just one person.  Im a little confused.
Ouch that sucks. Im sorry to hear that.
Why what happened? Are yall on a trip?
Oh wow so he basically ghosted you? I would be mad too
That sounds very bizarre.
I hope you are okay.
I hope this doesnt happen again.
Oh my what did you do may I ask?
That does not sound good. It must have been so embarrassing!
I hate public speaking too!
Dallas is a really fast city.
Im sorry things will get better.
Thats aweosme! Is he going to be staying with you?
That is terrible. What happened then?
I understand. My mistaske always happened.
Those are so stressful. Just take it step by step and you can get on track. 
That makes all the difference. I am glad you were able to get out of that position. 
You must be really excited for it! Do you think its going to be girl or boy?
Well it will great either way as long as the baby is healthy! 
Do you plan do something this weekend?
Yes. It is sometime nice to just rest at home.
That sounds like fun Do you know who haunts it?
Well if you promised I would try to go. Im sure itll be fine. 
Nice! You must be pretty confident she will say yes.
I hope it goes well for you and brings happiness to you both.
That sounds terrible. But hopefully it isnt suffering any more. 
I agree just remember her for all the good memories. 
Have you been studying? That is intimidating but I bet youll do great! Whats the subject?
What an interesting course! I hope you do really well. Exams can be so scary they can cause such anxiety. 
That is very bad. Did you complaint to the landlord?
I understand. The best thing is to move.
Thats awful! Im always scared thats going to happen to me when its raining
You got lucky for sure!  I cant imagine how scary that would be
Really where was this parade at? Im in Missouri and it was absolutely pouring on Friday
I usually dont let a little rain stop me unless its ridiculous!
oh no. feeling empathy towards them just shows youre normal. Theres a lot of people in your boat
whats preventing you?
you sound too kind. Youd be a great dog motherfather!
That sounds fun!  What are they exactly?
It sounds like you really enjoy it!  Good for you!
How exciting! She must be thrilled too
I hope you guys have the best time!
That unfortunate.  Are you feeling a little jealous?
I hate it when stuff like that happens. 
Haha nooooo... dont do that.   There are too many of those people in the world as it is.
Sounds like the best course to me 
That sounds so great. Being in nature makes you feel so good. 
You should just make a plan and do it. It sounds like it is worthwhile. 
That sucks sorry to hear that. Did you get a refund?
Hopefully they get your order correct the next time you order there!
Did it taste good?
Were you suprised that they did this for you?
Wow! How happy you must be. I be that day brought you lost of excitement. 
You must have great co workers. I bet your happy everyday you go to work
oh so sad  what happened to it
it must must a very much hard time for you and your family 
yes  he be rest in peace
I would be so scared. I think I might have to leave. Did the bears bother anyone?
Were you in a tent or a camper? I hope you kept your food locked up tightly.
Glad everyone is safe! You were very smart.
Oh Im so sorry to hear that. I know pets can be like one of the family. 
You should adopt a rescue dog. That would be great for the family. 
Thats disgusting. What did you do about it?
Did you get a refund at least? I would never visit that restaurant ever again if I were you!
Thats interesting! Most kids love being homeschooled but I guess she missed socializing and interacting with her peers.
Not too much longer! I hope she adjusts well and enjoys herself. Public school can still provide an enriching experience when it comes to social skills and education.
Wow good job! SO close
Thats a great accomplishment
maybe you should job a club or a social gatherings group
i agree. you need to socialize a little bit to get out of your lonely slump
that should be fun. good luck!
Aw thats annoying. Work always gets in the way of things. Did you ever try to go to her?
Im sure it will work out! Not this time unfortunatly but it will in the end
Did he take care of it for you?
That is great that he was able to show you he is responsible. I bet youre proud. 
Thats awesome what does your hubster do?
Wow I admire his dedication! And you wont ever have to worry about your vehicle breaking!
Hard work pays off in the longrun. If your work is truly authentic in its nature it is definitely going to be recognized and appreciated
Be careful while negotiating your pay raise. Some managers may find it too intrusive and that may leave bad impression on them
Oh no do you think she was trying to get back at you for grounding her?
I definitely remember trying something like that when I was a kid.  I think sometimes kids think theyre sneakier than they actually are.
Whow!  That sounds really disgusting!  What did you do?
Man you are a good friend!  I would have been beyond angry!
So sorry to hear that. It is truly horrifying and i wish and hope for nobody to be hit with this calamity
Indeed. Friends should be together in times of need. That is what friends are for
oh no!! Did anyone notice? its normal though we all do that sometimes
oh man... It happened to me before i know how embarrassing it is.
Thats great that he passed though!  ARe you happy about it?
Well at least he passed  thats great!
That is pretty neat actually. I wish i had kids to bring to stuff like that.
I will do that i had no idea.
Im really sorry to hear that.
I cant even imagine to be honest.
I have lost grandparents and greatparents but they were all older in age so it was easier to deal with.
Im sure it will be different when its a parent.
thats awesome! I hope you will get a promotion. what do you do for work?
You will be a great manager! Good luck with everythig
you took a risk huh? i hope he will be a great worker! Thats good you gave him a chance
i hope it wont happen! 
Oh no! Did he say anything about it?
I know what you mean. Ive done stuff like that too  you do feel a bit silly dont you!
Awesome! What are you planning on buying?
Maybe you can figure out a way to get all three of you guys something!
Oh no that is crazy!
Well Im sorry you are going through this and I hope you can figure it all out. 
I hate those things i try to not eat those at all.
I eat steak and shrimp.
i really dislike snooty people who are constantly rubbing their amazing life in your face.
i wouldnt be friends with someone like that. i mean what can you benefit from that friendship?
agreed. you really wont be missing out on anything worthwhile.
I love Taylor Swift! Shes talented and beautiful!
How exciting for you! Have fun!
You have a test coming up?
Well I hope you do well! Good luck.
Thats interesting. What was she doing?
Thats awesome! I didnt know that place was still in business. 
Yeah I bet it is frustrating. The store gets reimbursed for the coupons so they should not nitpick.
I hope they get better training so you dont have to argue with them about it
Too old for what? What a strange thing to say.
That doesnt make much sense. Maybe I am missing the context.
Oh no he shouldnt have gambled. 
I wouldve too but sometimes people need to learn a lesson.
Oh no! Did you property get broken into? Or your neighbors property?
For real! Are you taking any precautions?
Inside the restaurant ? What kind of place was this ?
Okay that makes more sense then to me.
Where are you located ?
I wasnt even aware there was a hurricane.
Who did what?
Oh Im so sorry to hear that. People are so inconsiderate!
Oh no! Why not?!
I would make a complaint to the principal if I were you!
Never know who was?
Wow that is aweful! 
Oh wow what happened?
That would give me the creeps! Has anyone seen anything there?
I bet it was. Ive only had one creepy experience  that was in an old house in West Virginia. Im very careful to avoid those places these days!
Good for you! There is nothing wrong or uncool about short hair.
Great! Im glad that it worked out well for you!
Thats awesome I went to visit my parents and my hometown last month it is a great feeling.  How was the fair?
Brings back all the memories you had as a kid.  I miss going to the state fair was always fun.
You must have been sad and angry.
Yes first heart brake is so hard I feel for you something similar happened to me with my first boyfriend.
Thats awesome! Congratulations!
No way! Thats actually a super awesome prize! Have fun
Ouch hopefully its not by much. I remember when i was in high school i had a similar situation. Theyre usually pretty lenient on it.
Im sure your dad wouldnt mind haha its usually pretty cheap anything i remember they cost like 1.
Did you try to get the money from him? He sounds like a pretty bad person.
I do too! People like that make me never want to have a roommate! 
Oh wow. Thats pretty scary. I would be horrified.
Well at least they didnt follow you. How is Cuba? My parents are from there but Ive never been.
Oh no! Thats sad did he get them all?
Aw thats too bad hopefully next time they will be safe in the coop!
wow so what are you going to do with it?
nice i hope that works out for you... good luck
That is gross I cant even imagine what that would taste like!
Thats so gross I would take a hard pass on eating that. I like seafood but thats too much.
Omg Thankfully he wasnt hurt. 
Did yall happen to get it on video? 
Congrats! Im sure you must be very happy!
Haha brotherly love I hope him and the lucky gal have a wonderful life together!
thats amazing i cant wait to have my own one day
i bet so!
Is there something that is making you nervous about the upcoming week?
That can be stressful. I am sure that every thing with go smoothly for you! Just remember that the weekend is only 5 days away! 
We all do stuff like that. At least you didnt lock them inside your car. Done that before!
Yeah nothing like calling the locksmith and admitting you are not very bright. Haha.
Did you not want to go out or did you just not like the movie?
Just be careful with that. If you feel tired due to stress it may be the stress talking and not you.
Great when will you know your scores?
Wow thats fantastic.
What a jerk! That is definitely a problem!
Thats a real bummer. Do you at least pass the class?
Well at least you dont have to take it again. Could have been worse.
Oh no how awful for you! I hope people helped you to pick them up and didnt help themselves!.
Glad you find humor in it! I dropped a bottle of water once which rolled under the car. I was livid!
Thats extremely frustrating! What were they expecting you to do? Its not your fault your roommate left it trashed.
Well I guess the good news is that he no longer lives with you. But that blows how hard is it to clean up after yourself before you leave?
That is so annoying. They should not call it that if they cant guarantee 10 minutes.
Hopefully the food was at least worth the wait. I would have been annoyed as well.
Oh god! I havent had a puppy in a long time but you forget all the things in your house that are not puppyproof. They find ways to make messes in the most creative ways.
Yeah thats a real headache. Id want to say theyre worth it but on that day I wouldnt be so sure haha.
That is a huge blessing I dont know about you but my life is pretty much keyed into my phone.
Its almost a shame how much we depend on them but I know Id be lost without mine.
Do they run them all day long  or at night?
Is there any kind of noise ordinance in your area?  I know in ours unless they are still running them at 11pm there is nothing the police willcan do about it unfortunately  but I can imagine how annoying it is.
I dont blame  you because I hate camping.
Oh I hate ticks and all the bugs.
You are lucky to have such great friends!
oh that sucks i hope it has healed since then
ouch that sounds awful
How come? Have you had awful weather lately?
Oh I see. Beautiful weather is an excellent start to the day!
Oh? Big decision. I hope you feel good about it!
Aw but theyll always be there for you when you visit. You have to do what you want to in life after all
Oh that sucks! What did your neighbor do to get you angry?
How inconsiderate. People should have more common sense than your neighbor.
thats awesome i always loved giving gifts more than receiving them
I hate when I get teachers that are clueless. Makes you wonder how they got the job.
Well done. You should feel proud for teaching yourself.
Thats always a great start to a day.
How are you celebrating it?
Oh wow. Whats the exam on?
Thats really great. I am sure you will do well on the test.
Well that is really lucky you were able to avoid that. Hopefully he didnt hurt anyone else.
Congratulations! Retail really does suck.
Understandably. My girlfriend is a student and works in retail parttime. She says the same thing.
Oh all the time. What album is that for you?
I really love that album! We will have to listen to it together sometime.
That sucks. Did she make a lot of money off of it?
I wouldve been very angry too. I hope the money went towards something useful.
I am sorry to hear that. Why was it a bummer?
That really stinks. I bet you felt really lonely and filled my regret.
That must feel very refreshing. Would you say you feel content?
Nice! I want to get that game next week. Looks really cool.
That is disappointing. I wonder why hes like that.
I hope he doesnt let you down.
Something good happen to him recently?
Thats amazing! Tell him congratulations from a friendly stranger.
Oh no thats not good! Hes not the only one thats not great at French. Most of my family spoke French as a second language when I was growing up and I still never picked it up!
Hopefully hell get to enjoy his next summer.
That sucks. Did anyone get hurt?
I bet. I wouldve hid under the table.
Thats nice. Why do you say that?
Thats great to hear. I wish I had a helpful family.
Thats really selfish. Have you talked to her about it?
Well at least thats the case. People can only do so much.
Well sometimes that isnt a bad thing really. You didnt enjoy it at all?
Are the good memories at least?
At least you have those memories. You should go on a vacation soon!
Ive actually havent played that series. When does it come out?
Thats rough. Why cant you help her?
Yeah I am in the same boat. Its a hard knock life out there.
How long did it take them?
He must of been sick after.
That was probably a good plan to buy them ahead of time
Wow thats insane.  I feel like thats illegal
Are you going to ground him?
Why dont you join them?
Why dont you get another job?
Thats too bad. What happened? Is everyone OK?
Oh Im so sorry to hear that. I hoep your family is strong enough to support you through this.
Holy cow.  Was anything missing?
Had they gone through anything?
oh yeah that must have been a good time
Those are the best times when they still like to play with toys mine lost interest years ago and I miss it
that is awesome i will never forget the first time me and my wife went on vacation where do you have planned to go?
That sounds like you guys will spend a lovely time over there good luck
I miss her. You havent seen your mom in a long time?
Im sorry but I cant understand what youre saying.
Oh man! I have been there I hope you didnt have anything special down there??
Oh lord i am so sorry! I have been there that is hard!
taht sounds like fun i wish i had coworkers that nice ahahah. did you enjoy the party?
ahahaah seems to be they really like you working threre
Aww Im sorry.  Is he going to be ok?
I do too.  Thats one of the saddest things.  I hope youll be OK too.
ooops sorry to hear that
oh that sucks.. did someone move it out of the way?
yea you never like to see stuff like that.
did you try to find its owner?
well that was nice of someone
Thats annoying are you going to talk to them about it?
I hope it all works out in the end.
Awesome! Can you say what kind of project it is?
I hope so too! Projects can be stressful!
What is the appointment for?
Lets hope not! My prayers are with her.
Youre welcome. Its always nerve wrecking when family is sick like that.
I think there might be something wrong with the platform at the moment.
Oh man sounds like most kids. Shes gonna hate it at first but getting to bed early will help with her future.
Well yea theyre young right now and cant see the consequences yet.
that is so lucky they must be so happy they bought that ticket
i know that is such a bomber you must have been so angry hahaha
Oh I hope you do well then
wow i didnt even know they had cruises that go on for that long
yea i wonder how much something like that costs .. i guess if you have to ask you cant afford it as they say
that is really nice of him how much time will you have to wait?
well i hope everything goes well at the bank and with the transaction
that is horrible natural disaster are the worst because you cant do anything against them
not really the worst thing that can happen where i live is a thunderstorm
I bet that was a wonderful day
I am very happy for you
that is not good have you expressed your feelings to your boss?
well i hope everything goes well for you you will sure find something fitting for you dont worry
Its a whole new world when that happens I can totally understand. Howd you cope with it?
Its always best to just open your mind to anything that could happen. Its the best way to learn.
Oh no thats bad.   Have you had someone come out and check the hose?
May be worth letting your insruance comapny know. Usually they have clauses that you have to tell them as soon as you see it otherwise they wont cover any of it.
oh that explains it!
Wow when the child just asked?!
Im only afraid that the mom is going to let out that embarassment on her child once they get home.
OMG thats so gross! 
That would be a memorable lesson to learn. The best lessons are learned that hard way after all. 
Oh god. Thats kinda gross.
Rest in peace whoever touches that rack.
Oh dear. How do they let the parents know whats going on?
That sounds really frustrating. Im sorry thats happening!
Oh wow.  Terrifying.  All I think of is Johnny Erricson Tada who broke her neck in that situation. Did you do it?
You did the right thing!  Oh fun!  Im glad you were safe and had a blast! 
Do you feel ready for it?
Awesome hope it goes as planned!
Oh how exciting! Did you take any pictures?
Awww...thats a bit disappointing but really cool that you got to see them!
The market can be competitive if the price is right. Theyll sell immediatley.
That would have been awesome if you got it.
Thats good! That probably means you worked on it until it became something youre proud of.
Maybe I could learn from that. I get really nervous when I have to do any public speaking so maybe if I just prepared for it better it would help.
What did they do to you?
It happens sometimes. you may ask them directly to pay back.
I totally get that.  Im in the same place with my daughter.  I home school and shes learning them too. Give it time and shell get it soon.  Its so much to memorize at once! 
Thats awesome!  She will!  The best thing about homeschooling is that they can learn more at their own pace.  Im not looking forward to division! ha ha
Do you hike very often?
Ive never been hiking really! Id like to go some day.
Oh such fun!  Do you have all the Stamp It Up scrapbooking things I hear so much about? I bet it can be hard to keep it updated! They grow so fast!
Perfect!  Now youll be caught up in no time.  I know youll be so gratified to finish and be able to look at all of them when hes much older.
So sorry to hear of Sams passing.
May your many memories of Sam help you to sustain at this difficult time.
That is awesome.  Im with you on that.  Tough times might pop up now and then but life really is great.  I dont like to take it for granted.
Exactly! Youll go far with that attitude!  
Mmm now youre making me hungry for cake. What kind of cake was it?
Personally Im a huge fan of red velvet but black forest is amazing too!
Aww I know that can be hard but you cant be too hard on yourself.  Sometimes you dont have a choice.
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.
What are some of your best traits?
Do you exercise often?
Oh boy that is great news! I hope you didnt drop a pretty penny on it! Haha and even if you did dogs are worth it.
Hey runts are the best! They need love too. Either way Im glad you were paired up with the perfect companion.
Ive never been but it looks like so much fun.
It would be so much fun to go there as a family.
Oh yeah I am right there with you I just dont even go out anymore if I can help it! How old is yours? Mines 2 12
They are too smart for their own good
what did you see? please dont tell me there was a bug in your bread
ewwww so nasty! i almost ate a molded avocado today. good thing i noticed before scooping it
or maybe she just knows youre a great worker and very responsible? I hope you will get a raise after completing those tasks
did you try talking to her about it? Just be straight forward and tell you how you feel
Its horrible to have to got through things like thaty
Thats great! Im so happy for you!
Ooh will you be managing anyone?
I hear you! I drop things all the time. Was it one you just bought?
Ugh! Were you away from home?
Oh wow shes doing great. I know it probably feels a bit bad that shes making so much more than you but hopefully you can find  away to be proud of her.
Oh well thats great! Some people would get a little jealous. Im glad youre proud of her Im sure she worked very hard for her success!
That is a good feeling!
Nice! No kids at home?
Are you afraid of the dentist?
Im sorry to hear that Im pretty terrified of the dentist myself. Ask for gas! Good luck Im sure everything will be just fine.
Oh nice! Thats super brave of you.
Thats a great skill to have!
That must have been a nice feeling. 
I love that nostalgic feeling. 
Haha sounds like my pupper is she still young?
Right!? Its weird you buy them all the toys in the world but they still go after your stuff.
Why he is working late?
I understand. Could you plan to do something when he is late going out with friends?
Aww man that sucks for you 
Hopefully! It is your dream car after all
That should be fun. Any big planes?
That will be nice to catch up.
Thats not very considerate of her. Was she a bad neighbor while she lived there too? Some people!
I wonder what could have changed? Either way Id be pretty pissed off.
Oh no! That is terrible!
I understand. Layoffs are hard. My brother in law has been through a lot of those at factories!
How do you feel these days?
It must be difficult do you think she will come back ever?
Ouch! Thats rather painful. What are you doing now?
Wow! Thats like a paid vacation!
Wow thats incredible. Whats their secret? 
Congrats to your friend. I hope they share!
Thats unfortunate hope you dont get it as well!
Im sure she will be fine with some rest and a little bit of time. 
Wow... thats kind of creepy actually. Were you able to get it back?
Youre very lucky he was nice and didnt steal any of your data.
Did you bring them a pan of ludefisk first? What did they say?
Next time they let you in just steal all your favorite pieces of decor and replace them with brownies.
Yeah they are cute like that. How old is she ?
I have a 10 year old like that.
thats amazing. watching your children succeed is so rewarding
that is awesome. i hope she has very much success in her gymnastic endevours.
you are very welcome. good luck!
Thats awful! I hope that she didnt mean too!
Yeah It really sounds like she didnt mean to. Sometimes you can find copies online if you look. 
Im so so sorry!  We lost our chihuahua in February so I completely understand that feeling.  Was he sick prior to passing away or was it sudden?
I think it might actually be harder to watch our kids go through that kind of loss than to actually go through it ourselves.  Our pup was our daughters dog and she was sick prior to passing so we knew it was coming.  Still doesnt really help though.  We ended up adopting a pup from the shelter that had lost her human mom  it was meant to me  my daughter lost her pup and this pup had lost her mom.  Its helped something to think about at least.
I am sure she will be smart with it
You can always show her the ways
Were they okay?
At least youre not getting sued
Im good at that lol
Dont worry youll be fine.  Its safe.
Im surprised you havent started to relax a little yet.
I can only imagine. At least its nice in the day time though?
I am not sure I would do well in that house
Bet that brought back good memories.
Where did you guys usually go?
whats the competition on ?
Nice hope you win  ill be looking into this further 
I wonder how that was noted on your report.
Sounds like a wacky place to work.
That is awesome. Congratulations. Im sure you earned every penny.
Good things happen to people who put in the effort. It sounds well deserved.
Oh no! Do you think its a wild animal?
I hope its not a crazy person or worse an alien waiting to abduct you!
Its so hard to monitor that stuff now
Yeah that is a scary thing to think about too
On no!  That is no good!  Is he still a puppy?
Hopefully he is not doing it out of spite!  Maybe you should hire a dog trainer to see if they can correct his behavior.
No way? Do you have proof? That is terrible.
Wow. That is horrible. I would get a camera and try to film them in the act and go to the police. I would be so angry.
you havent met all three people in the city yet?
ah well it sounds like i hit the nail on the head
What kind of job was it
Sales do sound hard to do
Is he going to be okay
I am glad then I hate to see pets in pain
That is quite an accomplishment.  Someone like that is really inspiring.
Hahahaha its hard to compare yourself with that but it really lets you know whats possible if you really want something.
Why? Were they not working?
He should have been honest from the start. Its on him not you.
Do you think your boss will tell him its you that told on him?
Thats so cool! Do you do a lot of climbing?
Wow so a proper adventure then. Have fun and stay safe!
yea funny how that happens
well at least its being put to good use
Hey congrats!  Is it in the same field?
Heyyy! Thats awesome!  I wish you luck! Will it come with a sweet raise too?
Congratulation. What is he planning to do next?
Good. I hope it will help her in career growth.
Thats cool!  Maybe youll get along great!
lol why do you have to steer clear?
ahhh.  I got you!  Well good luck on the relocation!
That is a bad realization to come to.  Where did they all go?
Yeah that is tough.  Once you get to a certain age you have to work pretty hard to meet people.  Maybe you could join a softball league thats what I did.
It can be hard these days money is tight
Did you get it all straightened out?
Wow that is awesome too rare in these times count your lucky stars!
Oh wonderful!  Im glad it went so well!  Did she already know some friends there or was it a new school for her?
Oh boy I bet you were nervous.  I wouldve been too!  Sounds like shes got a great and fun year ahead of her!
That is just gross!  Have you spoken to her about it?
I hope the HOA does something about that  thats just disgusting!
Bet that was a nice calming down.
Did you get up to anything else fun?
That sounds awesome i bet you feel proud! Its nice to do things for kids who are in need.
Of course! Dont let fear of not finishing stop you from doing anything!
Oh gross I would lose my appetite
Yeah I would probably just leave the restaurant altogether
Oh my goodness that is no fun.  Was it poisonous?
They can still bite so its better safe than sorry.  My fatherinlaw just got bitten by a black snake recentlynot poisonousbut still painful.
Do you have OCD?
I just love when the house is clean makes you feel good.
Thats a bad supervisor. Did you call himher out on it?
I hope he got in trouble!
Oh most are dreading going back to school. Whats your major?
Nursing can be difficult but if you have determination and a good support system Im sure youll do great!
Im so sorry to hear that. I hope another opportunity comes up.
That sounds like fun!  Are you big into biking?
Mountain biking is great.  Is is really theraputic.  I hope you enjoy your new bike
Thats horrible. What can people do to change things?
Yes! The weapons thing is so important. 
Oh my gosh! That is horrible! I am so sorry to hear that.
I understand that. Just give it some time and call when you are ready.
Thats great. Getting good coworkers is so hit or miss sometimes.
That sounds like a wonderful place. Im kinda jealous hahaha.
Thats awful! What did you do?
No. I mean did you yell at the person or anything after they did it?
Woah thats really bad!! Is it due to cost cutting? They let you off.
it happens!! i hope you will find a better job with a better company!!
Oh no thats the worst.
I hope you can get it back somehow!
That is an amazing accomplishment.  What field are you in?
Im sure you know that she is so proud of you!  That is really incredible!  Congratulations!
That is so romantic.  They werent for any occasion?
Were they your favorites?
Oh yuck. Did you get a chance to return it to the store?
Thats crazy! Id leave it on the counter at the store. Hopefully you arent out much money.
Wow that must have been amazing!
Theyre going to remember that forever
Dang that sucks. Did you ever catch the culprit?
Yeah that guy sounds like a jerk. Did your insurance cover the dent?
Oh wow! My dog Jr died of old age too.
Oh Did something happen to him?
I am sorry to hear that. Mine died of old age as well last month.
Me neither but in the end I really didnt think about him as a dog he was just my buddy. I hope fond memories of him get you through this.
That can be so aggravating. Did the company make it up to you for being so late?
At least they made up for it. If they had not I wouldnt use them again.
I know the feeling. What team is he rooting for? 
I dont even know what team that is haha. Football is lost on me. 
Oh thats good last time my computer broke was a day before I left the country
I took it to the apple store and it actually got fixed in 5 mins just needed a hardware reset
Oh my goodness is he with the armed forces?
I cannot imagine how hard that is on the family and the soldier.  While I cant bring him home quicker I do want to say thank you to you  him and your family for your sacrifice.
That is horrible did anyone get hurt?
Hopefully you had insurance and somewhere to stay.
That is scary.  What was it?
Gosh Its worse than I thought it would be.  What did you do?
Sorry to hear that. What happened on the test?
Hopefully next time you will get a better score and study more!
He must be very smart
It paid off. Wish I was smart like that
Oh no. How old are you?
Is there anyone you could go and visit and maybe stay the night?
I hope things are better next time.
Thats great to hear that some really care and put effort in to their relationships!
Lol! Oh geez so many take years to get it ugh! But at least he finally has! I hope he is very romantic too!
Not yours? That is so weird usually they  are on their way OUT not IN! Lol
Did you eventually get it out? I would have been flipping bonkers! 
That sounds terrifying! Im glad you have a basement though it can be so dangerous if you have no underground place to shelter in!
Oh your right I have an almost 3 year old and I wouldnt know how to explain it as well! That is so hard sometimes because you dont know what to say!
Oh my goodness are you alright? I bet you created a mess!
I hope you can laugh a little about it now!
That sounds like a great gift. That is going to be a great time.
Wow. I am sure you will remember this for a long time. You are going to have to think of a great surprise for him now.
Im sorry to hear about that. It sounds like to me that he lived a long life with you though and that you were able to spend a lot of time with him. Im worried for my girlfriend and what shell do when that happens to her and her dog
Thats crazy and a little heartbreaking too. Im envious of the bond and routine it sounds like you guys had. I have yet to develop a bond like that with a pet. I hope I do at some point
Thats so sad...Did you have a lot of good memories in that house?
Im so sorry  At least you have your memories to look back on.
That was really nice of him. I know that she had to be relieved.
Someone was watching over her.
How long had you been married ?
Hmm. Thats a bit of a strange story.
I hate to hear that. I hate tickets. There are so many other things I would rather spend my money on.
Yeah that is such a silly thing to get a ticket for.
Cool what are you getting?
Thats a nice car you are going to enjoy it.
Neat! We took our daughter and her cousin camping about 2 weeks ago! Did yall build a fire?
Thats defiantly a priority! I hope you brought everything that you need. Forgetting something can be a pain
The 16 times as in multiplication?  Teaching children is so rewarding.
I bet she was super excited to get it all down.
What grade is she in?
What kind of school was she at before?
Where did you go ?
We went there a few years back. Had a great time.
Awesome news!  What was the response?
Oh.  Not so good news then   Im sorry.  Im sure youll find something!
Thats awesome I bet you were overjoyed with it!
You never know if someone is going to slip and spoil it for you thats true!
Oh no!  Do you have any way of finding out who did it?
Yeah thieves are terrible.  I mean who would steal a mower?
yea i can see that it happens but it sucks
well atleast you watch them with him! i dont like them either. 
Oh no no thank you! lol ahhh i cant even. 
Thatll be tough.  Do you have anything you can do to keep busy?
I bet.  Its sometimes surprising how much your life revolves around the other person being in the house.
spray water over there
thats good you should
Could you get with your HR department to see if they can assist?
What would you do to them?
Yea I used to hate it too.
Like a paranormal type fear or a human with intent to harm type fear?
is it really hard? or you just have not have that much time to paly
yeah some people are just naturaly good at video games
Thats pretty impressive does he have any training or just all self taught?
Well its certainly nice to have someone around with handy knowledge like that!
That is frustrating!  We have a couple down the street that raises hunting dogs.  So annoying all day!
I am sure he thinks its his world the rules dont apply to him.  Sorry you have to deal with that people can be so rude
Well you must be happy about it.
Oh! that is bad then.  Be careful.
I hope you hear good news.
I understand. I guess youll always feel that way.
It was nice of you to buy him food but Im thinking he didnt pay you back.
Im sorry. I know it sucks to need money and be counting on it and then you dont get it. I hope he pays you back soon.
Ugh! I use to have the same problem with my neighbors dog who would poop in my driveway! At least it was my tires and not my feet that got the unpleasant surprise.
Does this happen often? Id let my neighbor know about it.
Thats great! You must have been so surprised and pleased to hear from them.
I bet you had tons of catching up to do!
The way you wrote that makes it seem like youre anticipating something bad... Do you mind if I ask what youre expecting to happen?
Interesting... well then at least that leaves the possibility for something good instead. If youre not sure what it could be then at least its not some obvious mistake or negligence on your part. I hope for the best for you
That is unfortunate my own mother was ill for several years she is getting older as well. Do you get to see her often?
Just spend what time you can with her Id like to say something really profound but aging parents is a situation that just sucks. Sorry you are having to deal with it.
That was great of him!
He sounds very nice!
Oh really what was the assignment
Its always great to get back positive feedback!
What was it like when it showed up on your door?
Thats hilarious You finally got it though uhuh?
Im sure they had a good excuse.
Oh I see. Hopefully its just that one time where he couldnt get to his phone to let you know.
Oh crap! how long untill you realized?
Thats so good man I have done that a time of two.
I am sure you will as well. Confidence is great!
Congratulations. You have done great!
Thats really cool. What kind of car?
That  sounds like a really awesome car!
Aww thats really sweet and sentimental. I like that. Can you still read the words on it?
I was going to say yeah thats the kind of thing I would love to preserve in a frame or something for my office. How cool!
Who did you go see? And are you still friends with all the same people? I wonder if any of them kept their ticket stubs too.
that stinks. what did you do?
and did you find one?
oh that is awesome. and you got a fancy pen out of it
Did it went well?
That is great. What was the issue with your ear?
you made quick work out of that
i wish i could unload that fast
oh goodness. that has happened to me before. i could not sleep
how in the world did it get in your house? were you able to kill it?
Well you two have fun tonight.  I wont tell your parents about all this.
Why you need to thank her? Is she the one that helped you to find the new job?
She is very nice person. That is great.
Oh. Will he be starting elementary school?
aw hes at that precious age where you have to let his hand go hu?
Damn whyd you have to tell me that...Gawd thats freakin sad jeezus
I wish you and your fam peace happiness love and good health.
What? Do you have evidence supporting this
Good hope that bitch goes to hell...sorry I love animals and my moms dog died the same way
That is a big deal.  What are you going to do?
I would throw trash in their yard.
He sounds like a real hero though. I hope he comes home safe soon
I can only imagine. At least you have each other 
Are you and your family okay?
I am sorry you can replace it though
Wow!  How kind is that!  Their really are kind people left in this world.  How did you respond?
There oops.  Did you ever find out her name?  Or find out a way to thank her?
On no! Did you have to walk or did you call for service?
Wow you got lucky! Did you give him a tip?
Why did you feel you had to cheat? I am sure you could have passed if you had studied.
Well dont let this one situation define you. Use it as a learning experience and move on and do you best not to repeat it.
Thats so sad! What on earth happened?
Now that is quite embarrassing! What did your coworkers say?
That is wonderful!  She must be so proud of herself and I know you are proud of her.  Its great that she likes learning so much.
Awww what a great idea!  Thats so cute! Where are you guys going?
You are such a good person to do that!
Its crazy how the tables turn!
Oh my goodness what happened? Did they find out you owe money to the local crime families? Those bank employees need to mind their own business am I right!?
That is absolutely unacceptable. Snitches get stitches thats what I say. Tell me where theyre at and Ill roll up on em and tell em what for. Just say the word. Ive got your back.
have you asked your friends for family?
i would def feel that way.its hard when you dont know the person or can trust them
Oh yeah? And what news might that be?
Nice! Did he sign up to be a waterboy?
Oh my goodness thats terrible!
What do you plan on doing?
uh oh. did something happen?
That must be traumatizing. Most people wouldnt want to go out alone after that. Its understandable.
Do you think you will get the job?
I hope you end up getting it!
Oh definitely Youtube is a great platform for these talented people
Yeah my favorite is watching short comedy videos of my favorite drag queens
do you think there something wrong
oh no thats terrible Im sorry to hear that
Me too! I bought about a thousand dollars worth of tickets last night!
You and I both! No matter who wins lets promise to split the pot.
Oh nice where are you going?
Wow Ive never been on a cruise before. I think it sounds like a lot of fun
Why? What did she do?
She is a special woman.
I would be downright furious. Start by smacking him across the face randomly at dinner. That should be a good segway into the conversation.
Oh he certainly will when he feels the hot guilty tears running down his face from that strong independent jealous filled slap!
Was any of your stuff damaged?
Oh wow! I am sorry to hear that. Maybe you can go find it and sail it to go kill Moby Dick to make up for the damages.
Exciting! Are you moving to a new company?
Oh fun! Im so excited for you. Try to learn as much as possible from this job and ask for career development opportunities!
Oh geez! What on earth was it!
That is FRIGGIN revolting!!! I would have lost my lunch right then and there!
No way. What happened? If honestly almost all my days are like this. So worst has become normal for me
Dont get it personally. Good performance will always catch others attention. Just continue doing your work
Thats awesome! Always good to be content with life.
Its good to be prepared for anything because you never know what could happen.
Definately! I have one daughter and twins on the way... I foresee love overload. How many do you have?
Thanks Motherhood truly is amazing
Not really do you?
Oh Im so sorry to hear that i hope it picks up for you maybe listen to a little music to lift your spirits
Oof sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do I guess
Well you tried to make things right youre still a good person
i can say that i am satisfied with where i am what i do and what its done for me. are you?
What are you packing extra clothes for? Did you go somewhere did something happen?
What concert is it? Are you excited to go?
OH MY GOD Im so jealous she isnt coming to my city this time. Youre gonna have a great time
Wow that will be a busy house
Thats a great attitude I hope you and your family stay happy and healthy
What did you lie about are you going to tell him?
HAHAHA if anything that is excusable noone like inlaws!
How scary! Im terrified thinking a tornado could pass by here
Well I hope nothing crazy happens and you guys stay safe!
Wow thats very nice of him! Was there a lot of people there?
Thats too bad. I hope you had a blast!
Thats a good idea! Its always smart to be on the safe side.
Ive done that as well where nothing ends up happening but I bought all this stuff. You never know what could happen though.
That should be fun what do you plan to do there?
I am sure people forgot already.
What job is it?
Only one way to find out.
What branch of the military then?
The marines is by far my favorite so good for him!
Oh no thats horrible. Have you complained to the electric company?
I would too at this point. It might be more reliable.
That will be no fun.
Dont you have to be selected first?
That sucks! i hate losing money as well. 
Thats how I always feel at those things as well!
I do enjoy the zoo and the animals. I think they could be just as good.
I think its a good outlook.
Hopefully one day you might decide to choose otherwise or have a child of your own.
Its a tough choice to make and not everyone has to raise a child.
i can say that i have mistaken something for what it isnt. but not sure about the ready for anything
almost? so the situation resolved itself?
What kind of interview?
I bet you needed help to take all the presents back home.
oh my god how did you get out of there?
Thats a great asset to have emotionally I think.
Yeah it might just be something youre born with.
I agree. Music used to have soul and good lyrics back in the day.
Hopefully music nowadays can take a note from the good old days and change their tune.
how did that go? did it bring back a lot of memories?
im glad to hear that. sounds like a great trip
Almost sounds like the erratic weather that we have here in Georgia.  I dont mind the rain as long as Im inside.  The sun is beautiful but sometimes it can be brutal when it starts to heat up.  Do you prefer sunny days?
I have to be very careful in the sun.  My allergies and the sun dont mix too well.  I can tolerate the rain much better.  I love the sound of water.
i can agree with that. i do feel the effects of age creeping up on me though
def. make the best of them
Its good to explore your own interests and what makes you grow on your own.
Hopefully one day you will be willing to explore a relationship in a serious way.
I once volunteered to pick up trash on the side of the road. Its amazing how much people litter
I wish. People might have more respect if they were forced to clean up other peoples trash as well.
Are you in a dangerous place?
I suppose so. Its great that you value life so much!
Oh no. Did it get ruined?
Close call. I once spilt tea over my laptop and the keys were all sticky for a while
Really? So sorry for the lose
Was she sick?
Thats a bummer. Its never fun to not win.
Hopefully youll have better luck next time!
Thats not good we ended up lucky with who we have 
Maybe you can find another one or go back to your previous company. Have you double checked with the company to make sure everything is ok? 
thats wonderful! I hope you will get that promotion! What do you do?
Good luck! Whenever you get that promotion we should go celebrate
I agree plus I love making snowmen! 
I always get sad though when they melt 
Ouch! Did they try to help you back up?
Of course! Well at least you also looked human. We all make mistakes.
That sounds really scary!  Is your son afraid or is he use to it?
I would hate that as well. I hope he learns to cope with it.
That is a lot of extra money to spen but it is completely understandable it you are that nervous about it.  Have you ever looked into calming medications or meditation to help your nerves?
I completely understand that.  My mother in law used to have really bad anxiety about flying but she did hypnosis and it really helped. 
Wow. Thats intense. Did your home get any damage?
Yeah. I feel for you. It hurts to lose things like that.
That is awesome.  Happy Birthday!  What kind is it?
Is that a gaming computer?
Sorry to hear about that. Are the damages covered by an insurance?
I understand. It is always difficult to start from ground zero. Good luck.
Interesting....did you do it
lol why would he get mad...but did you have fun in the end
Why do you cheat on him?
Oh I see why are you still with him then?
I know how you feel. Are you also spoiled by amazone prime?
Haha I know. Especially when I purchase firearms related things like ammunition. It has to ship ground.  1 week for shipping?!?!   rage.
Yeah the US is huge landmass wise.
You can always leave them an angry review online
What did your dog do?
Oh no well at least he didnt hurt the rabbit.
That sucks sorry to hear. Are you okay?
Oh nice! I bet youll remember that for a long time
Ive never been to a concert. I should go see one like you!
thats terrible! how does that make you feel?
That is the reality of life unfortunately! Thats what you have to enjoy life now.
That is terrible. How long have you had this pet?
Honesty is vey important. I hope she will not feel too bad.
That is going to be so fun!
I am never ready. which diet are you trying
I think my favorite and easiest would have to be Atkins but still alot of prep to get started
your welcome and I will check out Keto.
My kitties are my family too. Animals are the best.
Exactly! I am glad you have them
That sounds interesting.. What was it? And how did you find out? And why did he hide it! If you dont mind me asking of course...
Oh I see.. Well thats a pretty positive talent then huh? Maybe you should encourage him to keep doing it. Maybe he misses it. You could get him a present for his birthday or Christmas that was related to drawing toolspencils and all that.
how is that working out for you
practice makes perfect
omg i would be upset too... how many times have you called them to fix it? 
Sounds like a nightmare! total. 
Does it make you feel happy about your life since then?
Well at least youll always have your memories as time goes on.
thats why i dont watch sports lol we always make fun of our uncle because he talks a lot of smack and die hard Redskins fan
lol no! you shouldnt! thats the best part! Talking smack to each other
Oh I know how you feel! I wish there was some kind of hotline where you could report a license plate to law enforcement so they would get in trouble for being stupid with kids around
Thats awful! People should be arrested for that
Oh no!  Devastating! Im so sorry.
That makes me feel ill so Im sure you were sick. I hope somehow you make it up!
That could turn out expensive. Did they need a particular brand for a particular reason?
Thats annoying maybe they should provide links for you next time?
That is great.  Interviews are very intimidating. 
There has o be an easier way.  I have always avoided babysitting because I just dont like other peoples kids that much.
So i am guessing she gave you a good surprise?
Shes must be a keeper then.
That is awesome.  I have never won anything in my life.  What festival was it?
Congratulations!  Did you have a good time?
wow thats awesome.  How did you win them? I never win anything cool.
aww that stinks i hope you were at least able to sell them and make some money
That is crazy! How is he still employed?
That makes people look bad. I have severe anxiety and still go to work. I get that things are hard but.... its bad to never come in.
I am glad that you spoke out and shared your feelings. Its not healthy to self harm and pent up your feelings.
Thats what best friends are for after all. I hope things have gotten better for you.
Gesh thats frustrating. I had a dog that used to do that too. Had to get a trash can with a lid.
We even had to put something heavy on top of the lid to keep it from getting in it. Hopefully that will work for now until you figure something out.
That is awe inspiring very patriotic.  Did you get pictures?
Im sure that isnt something you see every day or would even expect to see ever.  Im glad you got it documented.
Well thats great. But you probably should study as well. School is very important.
Yeah that does sound like a conflicting situation. Well at least youre doing something positive.
I bought a lite brite from goodwill about a year ago. It was one of the remakes from recent years but we had fun with it.
Nope they only know how to touch screens.
Thats great! How long have you two been together?
You learn a lot about someone when you move in with them so if you feel comfortable in your relationship I think thats actually rather prudent.
Oh Ill bet that didnt smell pleasant.
Oh gross.  I hope she wont do that again.
Moving is the worst.  All those boxes.  ugh. i hope i dont have to do it for awhile
I hope its good that she moved in with you.  things must be serious
That sounds pretty amazing what convention was it?
Im so happy for you it sounds like it was a wonderful opportunity!
That is always so much fun. Which ones made you feel the most nostalgic?
I know how you feel. I feel guilty about indulging in ice cream the older I get.
Oh yes? What happened?
Oh that must have been so precious! We had deer around where I used to live  theyre gorgeous creatures.
Thats not much fun. Did he get a new one recently?
Wow youre smart and kind! I wouldnt know where to start re. building a computer. Well done!
What a nice thing to do. You seem to get on very well with your little bro.
I love my brother too. Hes a great guy. How lucky we are!
Do you know it was her for sure? That is horrible that you cant trust your own sister.
That is horrible. It sucks that you have to keep such a close eye on your things in front of family. I would be so mad.
I hear you! That sounds almost worse then a nightmare as it sounds like its stuff you miss!
Thats great! What kind of stuff was in the dreams?
That has got to be one of the best feelings. I love being complimented.
You should be proud of yourself. Keep pushing it and work and it will all pay off.
Dont put too much weight into those advertisements. Sometimes they are just there to get a rise out of you.
I know that feeling. Sometimes they can really get under your skin.
Thats nice to hear. Hopefully it makes you two happy. I would just unpack the necessities first and move from there.
Sounds like a plan! Make sure to hydrate properly because unpacking is cumbersome work!
That would be a great feeling.  Did something happen to make you feel more content?
Thats so awesome! Congrats! I am hoping to get there soon.  I have a lot to be thankful for but I know I need to work on just a little bit before I am fully content.
oh nice! i know that feeling is it home? what made you think about going there?
nice! hope you enjoy your weekend and make sure to make the most out of it!
yeah it can be akward some times specially if you dont know what to talk about
yeah a little chat to an old friend cannot hurt did you enjoy the conversation?
well im glad it did not go in the wrong direction
Do you think they deserved it?
Well as they say Better them than you
that is wonderful it is good to hear you guys are doing good progress
that is good hard work and determination will always pay off
thats a really good feeling isnt it? anything in particular?
Thats awesome.  Im glad youre happy.  keep the positive energy flowing
Im guessing it wasnt your fault? Do you know whos it was?
That sounds like sabotage to me. Is there any way to prove you werent there? I would be furious.
Did they not ever come?
Man thats a bummer.  Id visit you but that would be weird.
That is awesome.  What kind of designs are there?
That is very very cool.  I would love something like that in mine
Its always nice getting praise and compliments.  I hope everyone was proud of you
Thats great.  I hope you get a raise too
Wow thats really compassionate of you
Are you feeling much more motivated now? What do you want to achieve?
Thats such fantastic goals to aim for in life! I wish you all the best. 
Happy Birthday.  That was so nice of them.  I bet you were surprised.  Was there cake?
haha that sounds quite messy but I hope that it atleast tasted good
I agree you need money for everything these days and it controls us.
Me too I try not to worry about money so much. Theres more to life than that.
I hope your work continues on the path you want and expect.
Hard work is supposed to payoff right?
I know how that feels and it can make you sick very fast. Do whatever you can to try and get enough sleep.
If you get sick you wont be able to work at all so please take care of yourself.
Wow thats cruel.
Yeah that is a pretty good mindset to go by.
Just keep it up and you will go far.
that is great! Im also learning to write code.
HTMLCSSJava. Im excited about a career change.
oh god yes i know what you mean any ideas what you wanna do ?
uhoh did you get lost?
oh that is scary.  I hope you were ok.  make sure your doors are locked
what was wrong with it
good luck! we just had our mini cooper blow its engine yesterday .. 12.5k to replace 
Well music does have a really cathartic effect on people.
He can have a great impact on your brain and feeling that is for sure
Wow!  Thats a horrible prank!  I would be crying!  What did you do when your friend gave it back?
I would have been really mad as well!  Hopefully he learned not to pull that kind of prank on you again!
Im sorry to hear that. Do you mind if I ask what happened today to make it so weird?
Oh I see. I think I kind of understand. It at least sounds like youre a really selfaware person and appreciative of the small things and that you have decent perspective on things. The emotions might be difficult to deal with but at least there are some positives there for you to take stock of
thats crazy. and scary.  WHat happened?
im so sorry.  I hope youre ok
Getting paid is always a good thing. Were you waiting to get something special?
You deserve one. Did you get it?
I hate it when that happens! Were they driving fast at the time it could have been quite dangerous.
I can imagine at least you got out of the situation safely
Thats awesome. I think its great that you stepped up to repay your loans!
Oh man well I hope that it was worth it to take out those loans.
That is such a long time to live in loneliness. I suggest you do dogs are great companions
Sounds like a great idea! That would be very nice of you to give a dog a home
Wow congratulations!!  Are you guys excited?
I know the feeling!  My son is a year old so I remember it well haha.
You get a new trim?
Thats awesome bet you look straight out of 1990s.
What did you guys get up to?
What do you miss the most?
that is awesome. what did he make you?
that sounds yummy. im glad you had that special treat.
Do you know what kind of dog?
Those things can really fly on the ground.
Oh no! I bet she was mad as heck
Oh hey! If it works out for you have fun
Gross! Out of all the bugs that I find in my house those would be the worse.
Knowing roaches theyd probably survive it seeing as they can pretty much survive anything!
Oh no! Did he pass?
Thats great!! Hopefully he will do good in school this year and not have to go to summer school again!
Thats great. Maybe a promotion or a raise in on the horizon?
Well I hope that it goes well for you!
Nice! I hope you get this job if you worked hard for it
Just have faith in your abilities and the rest will come by itself
Im sure its always fun to view the progress of your creations.
That sounds nice having someone prepare a meal for you can be fun.
oh yea.. whats happened since then
oh well that sounds pleasant
Did it feel good to get back out?
How far did you end up running tonight?
Oh wow! Congrats! Thats great!
It is its something we all have as humans its not defined by gender show off your emotions proud.
It really is why would someone make you feel like it was for girls only especially being young but you are great now.
He should be ashamed for himself did he say why he did it?
Well on the other hand you can think of this situation as if you just paid 500 to a person to never bother you again.
Have you hugged him recently?
Im sorry to hear that he is a brave man.
Did something ruin it?
well thats not too bad
I cant think of a certain moment that the idea clicked. It seems like Ive always known they can.
What was that moment for you?
Im sorry but I am laughing. I bet you were so embarrassed. 
I would imagine. Just own it and wear it like a badge. 
Its nice to have the internet
I cannot even imagine
Sounds very relaxing to me as long as my allergies dont act up.
I always keep some propolis pills with me just in case.
What happened that made you have to do that?
OH goodness!  Are you ok?
I enjoy sunny weather too.
They must enjoy the rain.
Oh no Im sorry hun. I hope youre at least moving for a good reason like better opportunities. 
Well there is at least one positive. Maybe you could try joining some meet up groups to help you acclimate. 
I do almost everyday I feel like that is a great mindset to have to make your day successful.
They are but to just be able to continue throughout another day is a great feeling.
I agree do you have a favorite artist?
Yes he is great no wonder his work is so expensive.
Thats good. Did you find out the results of the test?
Good luck on the exam! 
What does providence mean?
Okay tell me more about that.
Thats great. Does he do photography as a job or a hobby?
Maybe he can turn it into a career and make a lot of money!
That sounds wonderful!  Ive never been on a cruise I bet you are excited and ready to go!
I know that feeling all too well.  Too much to do and not enough time to do it all and certain things you cant do until the week of.  Hopefully you will get it all done and then you guys will have a great time!
Wow what kind of dog did you lose?
Thats so tragic I have 3 dogs myself do you have flyers up?
Oof I hope that doesnt wake you up
Maybe it doesnt fell very comfortable with having you over and doesnt have any other way of expressing itself
thats cool.  Do you celebrate both of them on the same day?
haha I bet.  Thats pretty awesome!  
oh no. did something bad happen?
Thats great. I have always been nervous no matter who drew my blood.
She is going to be great at that job
Oh no. Howd they react?
Id be super embarassed too!
Wow thats horrible I hope he calmed down after and apologized to everyone
Yikes I would definitely stage an intervention with the rest of your family let him understand its not okay
I remember those
I never had one. I didnt know they were expensive
Thats great! I hope you keep getting good reviews like that.
Thats awesome. How much do you anticpate the raise to be?
oh thats cool is she good ?
oh that sounds like it will be very rewarding!
a tough situation but at least you were able to realize and adapt!
Oh god. The living room is shared. She should just leave the messiness in her room.
Im so sorry to hear that. How old is the cat?
All you can do is make sure shes not in too much pain as she goes.
I hope you walked out right then and there!
ah that was really disrespectful of her though. Thats not someone youd want to date long term.
That is good to hear. She should be a big help a lot quicker than normal then.
That should bode well for her and her future there though so it was a good surprise!
How has it been going?
That is good hopefully you find your soulmate.
Oh god. Did anything happen?
Well I hope nothing bad happened!
I watched it too! My favorite is Federer. Who is yours?
I have for the past 10 years! Its one of my favorite sports to watch.
Thats great. Do you thiink you will get a raise?
Confidence is super important
good luck. even though you dont need it
Thats great! You must be happy!
How come he came home early?
Thats really thoughtful of you. Do you typically do things like that?
Perhaps I should find the local shelter in my community and do the same. I have never done that before and I feel like I should be giving back to those less fortunate in some capacity.
Yay! Do you guys have free time to spend together now?
That sounds great you should make him dinner to surprise him back!
How long did that last for?
Why didnt you tell them to move?
You must really miss them.
Yea. Seeing each other on a screen definitely cant beat being with each other in person.
did he catch you doing something crazy?
Thats good lol
Thats so sad. Do you have any other friends there?
I am so sorry for you. Perhaps you can hang with her after your workdays?
New York is a fun place to visit.
You will have a blast.
Oh no! was it too short for your liking?
Yikes! I would ask for a refund for sure
Wow! Well a cheat day here and there might be okay! Haha
Right but Id say once isnt too bad as long you stay on track.
I would feel terrible too. Where did you move to?
Ive moved almost half a dozen times in my life before so I completely understand. Those were rough times.
That sucks imagine being in an environment like that all day I would go crazy
I guess some people are just really rude no matter what position you put them in
Its hard to trust a GPS. I have heard a lot of stories about people being steered the wrong way. Please tell me you didnt do it.
I am so glad that it didnt turn out bad for you. 
what did he do  how did he react ?
Well he is the one missing out and  im sure your very worthy of attention from some better.
Why was she upset? Depending on how many people entered fifth could be really good.
Thats still really good! She did better than 25 other people. 
NIce! I bet you cant wait! Do you anticipate to releax or do things to catch up?
Very nice! I bet its going to be a good happy weekend. 
Dang and here I thought I was lucky winning a free soft drink in that contest. Maybe we have to pool our efforts together and try to win us something big?
Why stop at 50? We ought to get 100! We need to show your friend and evil corporate Taco Bell who is boss and nab us some consoles!
Did you let him?
You are good to allow him to borrow the car.
Wow I really like to do that. I hope you will enjoy it..
Ah ok. If you try once you will be alright next time..
That sounds revolting! Have you said anything to him about it?
That sounds like a good plan. Perhaps you should request a formal resume from any potential roommates for your future abode.
Did you ask her to stop it or did you have to move away from her?
That was very rude of her to do that some people just have no manners.
Thats so exciting! Have you run a marathon before?
Thats good I hope you do well! How did you prepare?
What a nice surprise! Did something happen or did he miss you!?
I see.I bet you and him are happy to be able to spend a little time together. 
Im sorry to hear. Why is that?
Oh well that is a fine thing indeed! I would be  jumping up and down!
Sounds pretty lonely. Did you meet or make some friends while out of town?
Ah I see. Staying focused is hard especially when your lonely.
Thats horrible! Is she going to try again?
It must have been awful to see that in someone you care about. Im glad shes not giving up.
wow  thats great. You must be loving it
You must get a good sleep now to enjoy the New york later
Nice! Were they scratch offs?
I will cross mine too! I hope yall win it big.
OMG....that had to be so scary.
I am so glad that you are. Now no more driving when your sleepy.
That really sucks. Maybe you should try egging their door? Or just break in and pretend youre bigfoot while theyre trying to sleep.
I would go with the bigfoot option. You can get a costume on the cheap on ebay nowadays. Ive used that tactic countless times and it has never failed!
That is some exciting news. Do you already know what kind of vehicle you want?
Christmas is coming early. You will have to take me for a ride.
I am sure you will. Good luck for you!!
Whats kind of exam is that?
Dont be. i think you will ace it.
exams are always scary. we just need to take the mind out of it
Why not block the calls?
Have you asked them to stop calling about this topic?
Have you spoken to him?
Maybe you should buy some earplugs.
I love tennis. Will you watch the US Open?
It is a great tournament you should watch.
So are they telling you good news?
Oh okay. Well hopefully they give you a chance to breathe and decide what you want to do.
Ooh how nice! Do you have any guesses as to what she may be making you?
Well I hope its good! Your mom sounds like a great person to have a fun surprise for you like that.
You are so lucky to find someone special online. That can turn out so badly sometimes for some people. 
That sounds like fate? Being that both of you lived close to each other.
Wow watching kids grow up is hard. How has she been with the cell phone?
Thats great parenting! You have to trust that your children will make the right choices.
I am sure with your guidance she will!
You should go Otherwise the condition could get worse.
That is great news! fortunately doctors are there to help us and im glad they have helped you!
Oh my goodness that sounds so bad! Did they charge you for the visit?
You made the right move. They at least have to show up with that giant truck that sucks the tank dry.
If I had a bag of MMs right now I would eat them for sure!
maybe save the other half for later. lol.
Thats ok it happens to us all. Tomorrow is a new day.
How did she reacted to the admission to self harm? 
Now that your girlfriend knows the problem  the both of you can work on solutions and support together.
Is that like a laser tag place? That sounds like a lot of fun! What do you think?
Ive played laser tag a few times. I think you will have a great time! Its very high paced and noisy but thats half the fun.
Oh that sounds worrisome do you think you will pass?
Im sad to hear that but human nature is hard to fight. Honestly if you have any alternative options or plans you may have to fall back on them.
That sounds intensive! How did it go?
I bet that was so defeating! Im sorry to hear that. I wish there was better quality control with some of these companies that deal in parts.
Thats a good bright side to look at.
Did you save it or kill it?
Its missing a leg so its probably dead unfortunately.
ooh I bet you cant wait to finish!
I hope you get it! Good luck!
How did they go? Did you pass?
Wow! congrats you should totally be proud of yourself.
Thats very sweet! I bet it brought up a lot of feelings inside you.
You guys sound like you have a solid relationship. Its always great to find those little pieces from the early days.
Did you get her number?
Good man I have a lot of respect for that.
That sounds like quite the checklist. Im glad you brought the beer you might need it haha!
Well I bet youre going to have a great time. With that haul I dont see how you couldnt!
Holy cow! Did you call him in?
Oh man!  Do you have a dog?
How come? And was it a pain to replace it?
I hope he did a good job!
Awesome Im glad to hear that. Sometimes its hard to find contractors with good reputation.
How come you didnt collect them? i loved them myself.
Well they are expensive and you didnt really miss much.
Nice Was it hard to start?
Wish i could run close to 5km id struggle with 100 meters.
Thats cool. Man those tiny disks were easy to lose. what game?
Thats awesome. I get nostalgic about old games as well. 
That sounds horrible Did you wash it or throw it away?
That is a really rough story You should make him pay for another one.
damn is he ok now?
Did he go to the doctors for help? anyway im glad he is OK.
Oh no! Was it a fun night? 
Oh heck! That had to be really scary for them! glad youre okay though! 
Aww that sounds interesting!  Are you in touch with many people from high school?
I get that.  Its weird when I forget the name of someone I knew for years.
Poor thing!  Is he felling better now?  I hope he quit that diet.
Thank god he is ok.  There are very dangerous diets around better be guided by his doctor.
Were you nervous?
Thats awesome.  Im glad he did so well.
Thats lovely! I love waking up to awesome texts.
Thats so wonderful to hear.
I bet. Im not great at being away from my boyfriend.
Thats great! What have you been doing to socialize?
What kind of convention?
Thats such a sweet thing to do.
Dogs are probably my favorite pet. Maybe I should take up volunteering for a dog shelter one day.
Lil Peep died? when.
damn him and XXXtentacion were really good.
I love puppies! But they definitely are a lot of work in terms of their hair.
I understand. Our puppy sheds a ton too and he isnt even that hairy of a dog
Oh my that sounds like an absolute blast!
Did you stay for long? That would be a great vacation. 
What a great time! Is the cottage on a lake?
Sounds like heaven!
Aww Im sorry. Hope that teacher learned a lesson 
Its wonderful peace of mind to find someone you can trust with your fur babies! Did you have a nice trip?
Aw that was so nice! Id love to find a cat sitter like that!
How did it go? Whatd you get him for a gift?
It seems like all those years just flew by huh. At least now hes getting old enough to start remembering all these great times!
Are you feeling zapped from the week?
Im sorry to hear that. I hope you dont have to work through the weekend!
It never ends does it? I hope you keep your head above water though its all you got sometimes!
I feel that pain. Do you not have the motivation or just dont know what to do?
I get that. Well if I could give any advice it would be make sure you have proper form over anything. Dont worry about heavy weight if your form is garbage.
Sure. I love working out. 
How much pain are you on a scale of 110?
Dang that sounds bad! I know you might be frightened of going but I think you should go. Youll be better off for it.
That was nice of them! I bet you felt really cool hanging with them. How did it go?
That is awesome! I love festivals theyre always great to unwind and even just walk around talking to people.
Oh no! You mustve felt ashamed. did you return it?
Hopefully they were understanding that it was accidental?
Did you get wrote up or a lecture when you got their.
Its always best to be on time  I hope they understand no one is perfect.
The journey there is always the toughest its years of practice and studying but in the end it will be totally worth it
With whatever you decide in life just know that you are a very skilled and intelligent person! Im sure you will find your path in life eventually with time
Wow  that was serious then
OK  so what is your plan now? 
Wow that sounds scary. Did you make good friends?
Yes it can be really helpful! I went to school 3 hours from my home and it was still hard to meet new people
Oh that must have been a hard thing to do. Id hate to be the one to deliver such a bad news...
So sad...that makes me want to cry too just hearing about her reaction.
I bet it does! Do you go by there often?
I bet its much different than it was back when you lived there.
Oh no  Can you tell me? Its okay if its too private.
Oh my gosh Im so sorry that really sucks.  Can you talk to the professor and try to make it up or find out what you did wrong?
Good luck to you! I wish you all the best 3
Oh no why would they do such a thing
Definitely doesnt excuse what they did.
Thats not cool. I bet it felt awkward.
You are a stand up person!
Nice silence is golden
Full of what?
Oh no was it one of those meetings that should have been an email?
Hopefully you dont get in trouble but I definitely know the feeling. 
Oh really were you supposed to tell them?
You can never be to sure now a days they might post your secret to social media.
Did you ace your test?
I always worry when I have to take tests. Unfortunately I am horrible with tests. I am glad you aced it!
Nice what a legend and a gentleman
Word you should ask him what the secret is
That kind of cold disregard for someone youre supposed to love is totally alien to me the guilt would destroy me.
Yeah Freud called it Projection its too bad people tend to hide their true natures so well.
Its awful! I know so many families are dealing with similar situation. Sometimes we dont know how to help someone close to us. Heart breaking...
You cant help him until he wants to really change. Sometimes all you can do is pray.
Did she feel bad and apologize after she realized what you had done?
Its good to get to spend time with those you love. I am happy for you.
Thats inspiring has that worked for you in the past in the same way?
Thats so cool you seem very intuitive
That sounds frightening. Did you get home safely?
Why were you walking so late at night?
Nice what are some things you realized?
You dont have me yet 3
oh god how did you . have the courage to even go outside?
that sounds like an adventurous day 
Wow how could they do that?
Someones gotta put an end to that poor service!
You should. No matter what you cant lie to your Mom. It will always come back on you.
Come clean and fix it. It will make you feel better.
Nice! Do you have any superpowers?
I like your confidence! Fighting!
oh nice what kind of memories?
how does this make you feel like?
Thats awesome! Youre going to be rolling in the dough with those skills
Thats exciting. How long have you been learning programming?
an interesting one what does this make you feel ?
oh did he say anything afterwards? what happend next?
That is so kind of you I also a have a soft heart for animals.  I happen to be a dog person but I do have a cat that was my ex boyfriends.  
I cant say I have had any mean dogs as of yet.  My favorite breed is  a pitbull.   THey are so loyal  and sweet although  lots of people claim they are mean and vicious .
where are you going!
thats awesome i hope you have a good time with her
Wow that mustve been disappointing.
Oh! So close. Just to think about that missed opportunity.
Yeah its like time passes but the smells and everything stays the same
Yup and I feel theres a part of us that is eternal as well
I think I would leave if I saw something like that.
Did you tell someone about it so they could take care of it?
It seems most responsible to alert someone to clean it.
I feel that way sometimes when I check my bank account hows school going?
Word college is tough wishing you the best
 and got upset with you?
 And why do not you try to teach your brother?
Good for you!  I hope it does not stress you out though.
That is good.  Money is no good if you are not healthy enough to enjoy it.
Dang how fast did you run away?
Did you tell him how creepy he is lol
That is awesome what types of photos did you find? Anything funny or silly? 
Aww yeah those are great times that you can never really go back to. Sometimes I also wish I could go back in time...maybe you could call her up again and catch up on the last few years! 
Its not fair eh. Having to suppress those feelings day in and day out is significantly harder than the mundane work itself. At least its comforting know that most everyone feels the same? 
Maybe if we werent so attached to being creatures of comfort. Some things we just cant let go of wouldnt exist without some poor shmuck having to do the dirty work. I guess were all that shmuck to someone someway or another.
Oh wow what ovie was it and how did it make you feel? 
oh wow that sounds very emotional I think I would have needed a bucket to catch all my tears. 
I liked my friend very much and believed that he can not talk negatively about me
May be you are right. But sometimes you go with your heart not with the law. Murphys law may not work in every situation.
Oh no I am sorry to hear that. How is she doing and how are you holding up? 
That is great that she has such a great support group and loving family members to support her. I hope she gets well soon! 
Oh no maybe buy her a new cake to make it up to her!
Yes there is! Maybe throw in a cupcake too I am sure she will forgive you in a heart beat! I know I would.  
I am so happy for you! Why have you been apart for the past two weeks?
Awesome to hear that youll get to live with your loved one soon
Oh no what happened are you alright? 
Oh no that must have been a terrible experience I hope no one got hurt from the shattered glass.
Thats what I like to hear! What changes did you make this semester to achieve your possible 4.0?
wow. thats awesome! youll need  that work ethic in nursing school for sure.
It sounds like youre quite the organized person!
Im the same way a lot of the time. Its really a good way to avoid any unnecessary disasters.
That is so exciting! Best of luck to you man! I doubt she would reject such a great guy like you.  
That is great I would also be surprised if she said no to a man like you! 
I wouldnt worry too much about it. None of it really matters if we make a difference or not we all end up dust in the end.
If telling yourself that makes you feel better I found all of that to be much more stressful. To be completely honest with you I think people invented stories about the after life to make them more comfortable with death.
Yeah 70s were incredible the dancing the cars the women had style and the music was incredible.
But we got to make the best of it pretty soon elon musk will release flying cars and then life will be amazing again.
Congratulations on your success! I bet you worked incredible hard to achieve your goals.
There will always be people that are jealous of your success but it is up to you to be the bigger person and handle it with grace.
Oh no can you return it or get a refund?
I am sorry to hear that I would have felt the same way. 
That has got to be rough. At least it has a home now that hopefully has more time.
Im sure they will be great to him and hell bring them joy as well!
OH no! Are you the jealous type?
OH man! Yeah I would of felt the same way!
oh no do you feel ready for it? 
That is great I believe that you will do amazing! 
Oh that sounds really annoying. maybe you can look it up online or get someone to help?
Oh I see well good luck to you I hope youll solve it soon.
That is great what has been going on in your life recently?
That is good sometimes that is all you really need to do get things done  one step at a time  
They looked really exciting! Does it make you want to play it again?
If it makes you happy then you should do it! Capitalize on that nostalgic feeling while you can.
That is always frustrating. What happened?
Wow some people are just terrible! I hate when people dont take responsibility for their actions.
Oh no. What do you think caused him to do that?
What was it that you accidentally ate?
Eww that sounds horrible! Were you able to get a refund at least?
Im glad it went as planned. I can imagine that to be a very stressful moment.
Youve really got to be committed to go into work like that. Its not for everybody I agree.
I know how hard diets are to stick to. What foods are you avoiding?
Dont be too hard on yourself its hard to quit something immediately. Just keep trying I believe in you!
I get it. There is always another meal to start making the change!
Why not? What happens tomorrow?
Dont let it worry you too much. Just make sure you organize everything you need to present and remember to speak loudly and clearly! You can do it!
That sounds creepy! Is there any chance someone could start escorting you to your car? There is strength in numbers!
I definitely recommend getting some mace and a pocket knife. Stay safe out there!
I hope that all goes well. I am sure he will be good as new after!
I am sure the procedure will go excellently.
Thats really cool! I bet people really underestimated that underdog!
Thats awesome! Maybe shell come out of her shell.
Hes a brave man. How was the experience?
It sounds incredible! Hopefully it helped you conquer your fear!
Congratulations! Worrying about tuition is the absolute worst panic!
Youre going to kill it this semester! Youre going to be so proud when youre walking down the aisle to get handed your degree.
Did you guys write still write notes in each others books in high school?
Its amazing how many feelings and memories mementos like that can bring back.
Thats awesome! Hopefully it comes back in one piece.
I think it will be fine. I bet the new car runs well.
Im sure that is tough.  You must really miss him.
Do you get nervous being on your own?
Oh that sounds even tougher.  It is a long time but I hope it flies by for you and your hubby is back home again.
Im sure your not though! 
Thats horrible! Did you get the police involved?
Yeah i would have felt the same way. 
yeah it unfortunate we have to worry about things like this.
Thats a ton of traffic. I hope they finish their project soon
Thats unfortunate. I wish we could fly sometimes.
How lovely!  I such it was so nostalgic to talk about old times together.
That is a brilliant idea.  There is nothing better than catching up with old friends.
Awe your such a caring and loving person! Are you going to keep it?
The love and care you show him will bring him joy and happiness! 
Oh wow that mustve been a hard situation. Especially later when you were more in control again.
That sounds like a good decision. Good luck!
Whats happening this weekend? I hope you have some good things planned.
Thats awesome! Im very excited for you this is a good event for you!
Thats interesting. Are you okay?
Thats bad news. I hope that everyone is healthy and doing well.
Oh sounds scary!  I would have been scared.
Oh no! I hope shes forgiven you since then.
Thats probably a good idea.
Im sorry to hear you were upset! Why did you have to quit?
Wow that is a long time! Hopefully you can stay in touch with all of your former coworkers.
hmmn really?..i guess you must have felt very bad
am so sorry about that did he apologize?
Aww Im sorry that happened. Why were you embarrassed?
Its always difficult when you feel selfconscious  but Ive learned that people rarely judge you as hard as you judge yourself. 
Please try to be kinder to yourself! You are a great person with a lot to offer. Always remember to be good to yourself.
In reference to what?
My husband is my most trusted companion.
Thats horrible! Im a parent and I could never take money from my child. Did you confront him?
How frustrating! Keep your head held high and be strong. One day youll be able to keep him from taking your money.
Thats really nice however to keep the marriage fresh and strong I think its important for you to have outside friends.
Haha well I do know the feeling. I guess if it works for you then dont change anything.
what did you do???
well im sure youll get over it. nobody should make fun of our mothers
stay hopeful!  theyll release it sooner or later
its all gonna be fine and youll get what u want.
That is so sweet. It is wonderful to have things that bring back these beautiful memories. 
That really does make it special. Im glad you have that. 
....what feelings? what are you talking about
oh man thats rough to hear from someone older than you. is she ok?
That doesnt sound very good but jealousy is a hard thing to deal with
Other people deserve to have things too.
Oh no! When that happens you have to get up and yell Safe!
Awww well it happens to everyone sometimes. Just try to forget it. 
eh not really. what about you
and what does that mean practically? what will you do differently?
i love walking in nature. hiking is a great way to exercise and to explore the outdoors
Oh its always sad when someone you care about leaves. Can you at least keep in contact with him?
I know. It is hard to say goodbye to people but he is doing a wonderful thing at least. 
Everything is going to be okay. Try to relax. 
If there is something in particular try to deal with it head on. 
that is great.. may i know what you have learnt
it is challenging i guess.. best wishes that you developed skill over it
great day to you too
How hard have you been studying? Exams are extreme amounts of mental crunch time!
You sound very confident! I wish I had your confidence when I was in school.
I bet you will do great! What job is the interview for?
Thats a great field. My daughter just got a degree in art but she hasnt been able to find a job yet. Good luck tomorrow!
Good for you. Being prepared is always better than the alternative.
Dont get too cocky but enjoy your victory you deserve it.
Oh no! You must feel really bad. Are you able to fix the problem?
Please try not to be so hard on yourself! We all make mistakes.
Why do you need to go to the doctor?
Oh thats terrible. Did they take care of it?
That sounds very uncomfortable. Were you honest with them about your change of plans?
Oh I bet that was amazing! I have a memory of going to a waterfall with my parents when I was young and its a nice thing to think back on. Does your daughter remember it?
One day shell look back and it will mean so much to her! Memories with parents are the best ones.
I totally understand I hate carnival rides too they always feel so rickety. Do you have a particular one you fear the most?
Agreed a good theme park is nice because you know they have high safety standards but those carnival ones scare the crap out of me.
Oh my goodness! That sounds awful! Was this recently?
Im so sorry to hear that. Hopefully he has a good team of doctors that figure out what is going on. Are yall able to visit him?
Thats so scary!  You must have strong intuition
Im so glad you came out of it okay.  I hate driving in bad weather and reckless driving just makes it worse.
It was nice of you to at least think of it. Im sure she wasnt that upset.
Its totally understandable. Life can get really busy sometimes!
Oh thats not good. Did you get a warranty for the phone?
Im sorry to hear that. I hope that everything works out for you.
Did the other dog provoke him? I wouldnt stress it too much its just natural behavior for them take him to training school.
Oh then yeah invest in a trainer. I love dogs a lot but an aggressive dog is very dangerous.
Oh Im so sorry but I bet that was very special of you to find.
I would definitely make digital copies and upload to a cloud or a disk in case something happens.
Thats awesome!  Congratulations!
Nice choice!  Getting a B is definitely something to celebrate
Thats exciting!  Theres nothing like listening to your favorite music with great headphones
I agree 100.  Sounds like its time to start downloading some new tunes to test out!
Oh thats heartbreaking do you guys already have children?
I really hope she gets better too it must be terrible to know you cant have any kids. Youre a good man for helping her cope.
Young love its such a bittersweet quest.
I know right? I wish I was young again sometimes.
Its always difficult losing a pet.  Im sure you had a flood of positive memories and sadness than theyre gone
You just have to remember what a good life she had with you!
Nice! Why do you like it more than other places youve lived?
Thats good! Ive always heard that people are closer friends to each other in a small town.
Thats a blessing.  I know a lot of people didnt have a mom like that.
Is there anything she does specifically for her?
Im sorry. I know how that feels. Did you study really hard?
Oh okay. Maybe you should ask your teacher for some extra help or find a study buddy. i hope you do better next time.
Thats sweet! I have a great husband too! How long have you been married?
Thats great! Weve been married for almost 10 years and I still feel like a newlywed. Its great when you marry your best friend.
Oh gosh! That sounds frightening! Did you get out the taxi as soon as you could?
Oh well that was a smart thing to do. I wouldve bailed. lol
I usually love the trips down memory lane but the sad side of it are the ones who are no longer around. Im sorry.
Im right there with you. It makes you shed a tear sometimes too.
Oh. I know lying is sometimes beneficial in some situations. Hopefully you did this to protect someones feelings
Yeah I think that means you have a conscience which is a good thing. If you didnt feel bad Id worry about you!
That would make a funny video! We have a super friendly playful cat too.
Yes they are. He is my daughters best friend. She can do whatever she wants and he is unphased.
That was thoughtful sometimes i think kids fake being scared just to not be alone. hope you didnt get kicked too much!
Kids are interesting creatures thats for sure. Im sure you got some cool uncle points.
I feel the same way about my dog.  Theyre the greatest!
I dont know what I would do without my dog.  Im glad you have one thats always there for you!
Nice! What did you have? I am planning to serve breakfast for dinner tonight.
Mmmm. that sounds really good! Im thinking biscuit and sausage gravy hash brown and eggs...
I hate when that happens. I bet you meant well but youre left looking like a crazy person! I hope they understood.
I think they will get over it. Most people understood that not everyone is going to remember every little thing.
What happened? The yard always has mysteries!
Shocking! Has your kid done that before?
Maybe you should find him and apologize right now.
You could just cook him a nice dinner or plan a special date instead. 
Your welcome! Glad I could help!
I can understand the feeling I went through a couple of spells like that in the past. Im sure they mean well but youre at a point where youre hurting to get back out there.
Youll return to selfsufficiency soon you just cant let yourself fall into a pit of self doubt. Stay confident.
Aww thats so sad. Im an animal lover so I understand the pain.
Thats a really tough decision either way. I wish you the best with it and hope everything improves
Ah what a responsibly to take on! You are a great example is it quite tough?
Alot easier than a kitten or a puppy then?
Keep up the good work!
I bet you can see the stars and hear all sorts of wildlife at night.
All that outside noise can become so soothing if you left it.
Living out in the woods can really make you put things in perspective too.
Thanks that is quite the offer. How kind.
Did you wait until the last minute to ask for time off?
Yeah you might want to look into it then
Oh no! Have you tried taking your dog to the vet?
Yes google has a lot of great information for pet care.
Well that sounds like a high stress occupation!
Im glad you like it. I think it would be hard to get it right every time the way the market is sometimes.
I wish you the very best with it all!
Youre welcome. Be careful not to chase stocks too hard they dont always turn the way you might hope!
I dont know what you can do. A duck is just a toy that taste good to a dog.
Dogs gonna do dog stuff. Thats just how they do.
That would be bad you should double check before you leave
Yeah it is better to be safe than sorry
Why were you ashamed? Did she disturb the neighbors or something?
Im sorry that happened. You might need to get her obedience training
Thats awesome! do yall have any plans? 
lol maybe yall could find something to bond over
Yeah we dont thinnk about how special it was until it is gone
Yeah we all do but we can only go forward
Have you taken her to the vet?
You might want to look up what is going on online
That sucks. Next time they should tell you instead of laughing!
Im sure its not so bad. At least you can laugh about it now!
That is great! you should celebrate and enjoy this momment
that is good! I hope you enjoy yourself
Awesome! Whats it about?
Congrats! I hope it goes well. Are you presenting to a board of directors?
Maybe you can save more and be able to get one.
Man that gets to me when someone does that  like they are better than everyone else.
The holidays are a great time for that sort of thing. What did your family do together?
I understand what you mean.  I hope you and your family are all able to get together and enjoy each others company soon.
I hope you can have you applied or did you interview already?
well have you practiced interviewing? With that you can feel so much better!
Im sorry to hear that. Hopefully something better is coming along for you soon.
Keep working hard and I think your efforts will eventually be noticed.
Ah that always sucks did she need to go out or is she sick or something?
Well it isnt as if she did it on purpose dogs always have a reason.
Oh no is it painful and disrupting you in anyway? 
Yeah I know what you mean it does sound very scary but they do numb your face and usually they do not pull it out they fill in the cavity! 
It has been raining a lot here too. Definitely ruins a weekend planned outside of the house.
Thats good sometimes its good to just be lazy inside the house.
so are you making him a gift?
dont worry about it you will get it done and he will be proud of it
Do you have a general fear of flying or is there something about this trip?
Have you always had a fear of flying?  I havent ever really feared it but I dont like it.
Was it another boring day today? 
Ohh okay I see yeah I always get excited when new things happen at work too. 
I know the feeling. Hang in there! tomorrow is always a new day 
Did you hide the wrappers?
Theres very few brands I feel that strongly about. What kind of yogurt is it I might want to try it?
I dont think I have ever seen that kind in the store Ill have to look for it next time I go. I dont care much for the runny yogurt but I like greek yogurt so long as its whole fat and sweet.
That is horrible. Americas government wont be of help....hopefully you have family?
No cat or dog?
Yes I love animals and have 3 dogs right now.
Im sorry that happened to you and I will take your advice.
That sounds super scary could he tell that your were scared or nervous? How did you escape that situation?
Oh wow its fortunate that you managed to get out of that situation alive. Im glad you made it out of that awful situation. 
That sounds a little scary. Why was he running towards your car?
Did you give him any?
Aww I am sorry but I must say Pirate peanut butte cookies do sound good did they help you feel any better?
Ugh that sounds wonderful I would do the same if I were stressed I think
Thats amazing. Were you impressed?
That must take a lot of practice. I cant even juggle safe objects so Id likely lose an arm if I tried to juggle chainsaws lol
Me too!  I work at the registration department at a college and were very busy until school starts.
I think its the feeling of the beginning of something new.
Wow that is so sweet of her. She must really love you! 
Wow that is fantastic she is so lucky to have you around because you are such a sweet and caring person.  
Good for you friend! Im sure youll find something soon. What field of work do you want to be in?
That does sound like a really fun job. I also work freelance and would also like something more stable. 
Oh no they went on vacation without you?? 
Oh no that sucks I am sorry that you had to stay home alone. What did you do to entertain yourself? 
Oh no I am so sorry to hear that. How are you holding up? 
Yes I am sure that your cat is in a better place. If you ever want to talk to someone about it I am always here to listen.  
The big one? The bar? Thats a whole lot of schooling and effort culminating in to one test! I imagine youre very excited but anxious too.
Ahh. Still another stone set on the road to payoff. I wish you the best!
You study hard?
Oh no I bet you aced this one then.
Oh no have you talked to him about it? 
Aww man that sucks I am guessing that you end up having to do all the dirty work because he has been slacking off. 
Oh I would be pissed. Hopefully you had more so you could fix another plate.
Guessing he didnt get anymore food for dinner lol.
Id imagine so. What a great time of our lives college can be. The world just seems right being surrounded by your peers all sharing similar goals. 
Mmhm. I wish I studied more paid more attention and joined more clubs. But I guess thats the thing youre already as busy as it gets and unfortunately you cant experience it all.
 That is great confidence is always a key in success! I believe that you will pass as well! 
Yeah I bet! You will do great I have high hopes in you!  
Aw that stinks. Why couldnt they come?
That sounds really disappointing. Hopefully youll be able to see them soon! Im sure they were excited too.
Oh man I bet you did. I would have had a gag reflex if I saw some one puking at the bar. 
Wow they must have had 1 too many drinks if they could not even get to the bathroom. I am sorry you had to see such a disgusting sight 
Me too its so hard not knowing what to expect.
Right no one truly knows until they get there so scary.
What was the book about?
Im glad you were happy reading the book.
Oh I understand. I also remember mine. Do you remember something else about that day?
I imagine it was a big college. what did happen at the end?
Me too! I love that game!
I saw a machine one time that you could win live lobsters. They would cook it for you if you won.
Nice! How long has it been since you last saw her?
Man I hope you two do something fun!
All spiders or just the poisonous ones?
Thats fair I guess weird fish freak me out more then spiders through
Wow is she an older or younger sibling? 
Aww man that sucks One day your hard work will pay off so dont let it get to you too much. I am sure she is not intentially doing that
omg! I hate cockroaches they are ugly insects 
were you able to kill it? what did you do?
Well done. I hope you dont find anymore they are scary. 
Wow! that is really cool. Did he land the back flip?
What prompted his back flip?
It happens sometimes.  It only becomes a problem if you forget often.
I hope they were pretty understanding.
I hate burger king! McDs all the way
Adding mac sauce to a cheeseburger is a game changer
That is unfortunate did you fail the test?
You got this! I believe in you!
Wow! Did you tell them anything?
You should stop being their friend!
Oh snitches are no fun.
I would just keep to myself.
Well I think as long as you say sorry she can forgive.
I know how annoying that can be.  I love dogs but they certainly get do annoying things at times.
Maybe there was something outside or maybe he just wanted attention.   Dogs behavior can be hard to figure out sometimes.   Good Luck!
I have done that before. It is not fun.
I hope you threw out those pants.
Ooh what kind of trick did she learn?
Aww! I wish I had a dog now!
Okay. Im not really a fan of it.
Yeah that was a surprising result.
Does it make you feel like youre living in an alternate reality?
it can be scary at times. How do you deal with it?
That is a good way. I have a dog that makes me feel safe. Do you have anything like that?
You can watch some movies
It depends on your preference. I watch korean dramas.
Life is always a lot better when the sun is shining.
When the sun is shining walking and seeing the beautiful sights makes me smile.
That is good you have someone to share your happiness and problems with
my best friend is my boyfriend. So I share everything with him
Same here! where do you volunteer at?
That is so generous of you! have you ever thought of joining a volunteer organization?
what are those
??? is it a cancer of some sort??
That is excellent! I wish I had the courage to do so too. 
I think it would be fun to help someone build a house.
oh yeah? was it because you didnt know if you could do the work or because of all the hot college girls
well how did it go? did you do well?
That must be nice. I wish i had one.
Yes they do. And lots of care.
What about it made you feel nervous?
Yeah I understand. Big life changes make me feel uneasy sometimes too.
I lost my dog last year I miss her too. 
I agree they are the best. 
That must feel good.
Wow thats completely unfair!
Well i mean sounds like favortism to me. Siblings always get the better things 
Wow lucky you. I play those once in a year only
I do not play too much because if I do not win I feel it is a waste of money.
well thats good. whats the subject?
I hate chemistry because I think we should leave all that stuff to nature and just live our lives as the animals we are
do you have a good teacher?
Wow that is annoying. Did you get a spicy packet after?
That is okay mistakes happen all the time.
Did you drink a lot of coffee when you were a child?
I see that is such a nice way to remember your past.
Well did you pass or did you fail?
Well I guess you might want to study harder next time.
oh you must love getting cancer results!
thats why I do it for a great cardio workout. so what were the results?
and then what happened??
and then what happened
I hope something good was on
yeah you are. what show was it?
Really? what kind of icecream?
That is a good one! it is not always broken though. Sometimes they are out of ice cream mix because the workers eat it all
That is a rational fear when you are little. How did you overcome it?
Oh that is a bad place to go
Oh really? What were you guys talking about?
Aww thats so sweet 3
He must be a good person bit if hes a stranger is it safe?
That is good safety first
I am sorry to hear that! what was its name?
That is cute! is there a meaning behind that name?
That is good! Never accept anything less!
Im rooting for you! Get your dream person!
I can imagine how it feelmore so if its someone who never leaves hisher phone down.
The writing is very clear on the wall. You have been ignored.
Wow that sounds intense! I hope youll find out there was nothing to be stressed about after all!
Well I hope you wont have any of those mean teachers! Maybe youll have some awesome ones?
thats sounds amazing you
you didnt talk to any of them during summer break? is there anyone specific youre looking forward to see?
I feel you. I am still scared even though I am sort of successful now!
Uncertainty is the only certainty!
Have you always felt that way or have changed your view over time?
Well that is a good way of doing things as long are you getting the job right in my opinion.
Yes I believe in you
Your hard work will not fail you
Im so sorry.   
Well at least you came out without an injury? Or did you.
Dang! What are going to do with all that free time!?
Nice! Well I hope you have a nice and relaxing weekend!
Oh my god that sounds like the most terrifying thing ever! Where was this so I know never to go there?
Not surprising. How long did it take you before you were able to eat a burger again?
what kind of promises? who hurt you?
what is the worst hurt youve ever seen?
so I hear....
Wow that sounds like good news!
Im glad to hear he has moved on with his life! A huge step forward.
Wait you forgot youre vegetarian? That mustve been pretty shocking
Oooo you have to be sneaky with your meat habits my friend
Who have you helped recently?
Thats really kind of you. Does the old man appreciate it?
You are a good example to others.
Sounds like a great friend! Do they just listen or offer helpful advice?
Loyal and caring. Youve got a winner on your hands!
good to know. and what makes you life so good huh?
what if it all comes crashing down on you!
Did your mother find out?
How have you managed it? Have you thought about returning to the store and admitting to it?
That sounds unfair. Maybe youll get another chance to win.
Oh wow well there is always another chance we all learn on mistakes.
I am not much of a gamer myself. What is your favourite game?
You need to save your money to be able to afford it.
I can sympathize with you. Ive had a lot of betrayal in the past. The ONLY thing to do is to continue looking for trustworthy individuals. 
Not for naught but a dog wont ever betray you 3
oh my god did it take a lot of work? and did it annoy you when it fell down?
maybe this time you can do it somewhere alone?
Same. I hate my life. I sit in front of my computer all day
Well I hope things turn out better for you
why do you do it?
oh I see. what do you want to do instead?
Thats unfortunate. Did you make up afterwards?
Thats good. You guys are siblings after all and should try to get along.
hi what makes you think that?
fair enough my friend would you say your chances are high because of signs of other people winning around you recently?
Could she just be too distraught to pick up a phone? I agree that she owes that much to you but maybe shes too broken atm
Hopefully you dont live too far. I know this is a random chat but I genuinely hope your father is okay. I dont have a dad so cherish every moment you get.
Golf is by far my favourite hobby this sounds awesome! What island was it?
I will have a look at it on my lunch break today! I did snorkelling in the Philippines at it was amazing.  That was on the island of Coron
Ooooof lmao do you work in an office?
Thank goodness. You really dodged a bullet on that one
oh boy oh boy oh boy where are you going??
well I dont want to break it to you but those guys are fictional....
Did the secret negatively affect others?
I can understand that feeling. Well if it was pretty innocuous theres no harm and keeping confidentialiy
Oh wow more responsibility! I bet the pay raise will be welcome
Sweet! Sounds like a good job. How are the bosses?
thats a wonderful thing how long have you been married?
very nice its always good to find a faithful and loving woman
we all make mistakes  whats important is to learn from them! and you were young so its okay you know?
its good that you learned from your mistake!
Thats awesome! Tell me about her.
Aw thats great to hear about happy marriages! I hope you tell her often how much you appreciate her!  Im sure youre a great husband too.
Oh no! Did someone let it out?
How old was he?
Oh no I am so sorry to hear that. Its stressful. I hope your job is safe?
Totally. I cant imagine losing my job. Luckily the economy is pretty good so maybe they will find new jobs quickly. 
Why are you moving?
I would feel emotional too with such a big transition in life. I am sure you will enjoy university though
were they close to you? 
that makes sense why you got upset but in the end were all gonna follow them and you never now you may see them again
That is so heartwarmingly sweet. I know exactly how you feel since my family means the world to me as well.
Its true they grow up so fast. This is why we should appreciate every second we have with them.
Oh wow Do you have a college degree?
Why do you find it hard to throw away old stuff
So what are you planning to do
Oh no Ive had that happen before it is the worst. I hope it wasnt too bad for you!
I understand that all too well! Im glad it wasnt too bad though. Ive had some pretty embarrassing things happen while hungover.
did you apologise to him? maybe next time try to not drink a lot so you can control yourself?
im glad it made you more aware of what youre doing.
What are you going to do to change that?
Keep your head up high good positive thinking.
What did you do to it?
You are such a sweet soul. They say adopt and rescue dont buy
I wish I could have heard your speech. it must have been really funny.
I hope he had a wonderful wedding. He must have been proud of you.
Did you get the job? Or youre still waiting on the response?
You must be really proud of yourself. That sounds really fulfilling!
well if this isnt a great start for summer i dont know what is
of course you wont have an amazing summer!
Oh it can really hurt
Its fair that way
Oh no I am sorry to hear that. You must be very worried about her!
Oh gosh all you can do is try to be there for her.  But yes 14 is so young to be a mother. Id be very upset too. Im sorry.
Must have really brought back good memories. I love nostalgia.
Its a great thing these companies are doing letting you relive the good old days when youre older!
Oh no how embarassing! Did anyone see? 
I hate it when that happens! I hope you didnt hurt yourself and that somebody tried to help? 
How did it eventually go?
Congratulations on a new job
Oh no I am sorry to hear that. That really sucks maybe you can reapply soon?
I can understand that. I think the next company you apply for will be your time to shine!
Oh no! I confess I have done that to my kids!
Ha thats good! Mine havent gotten sick from it either. I just hate to waste food!
Amazing did you revise for it or are you naturally clever? 
Thats cool  I never had the concentration to study that much 
Oh man I would have moved out the next day.
I dont blame you. Ive never seen one before Id hate to see one.
Oh no. May I ask what you did wrong?
Where did they take you? Back to your parents or to the police station?
Did it work? Did you ever do it again?
Well try to stay out of trouble now you are a bit older!
were you happy for him? or did you get sad because you didnt want that to happen?
thats great im glad shes nice to you.
Thats wonderful news congratulations! Are you going to celebrate?
I am so happy for you. You should get a nice dinner with your family.
did he find out?
thats good you told him. Thats a lot to keep inside. Hopefully he wasnt mad
Ohhhh that is so bad. Why did you cheat?
Oh no sorry about that. But have you confessed to her
well thats great news congratulations how long have you known each other?
thats good that you put a lot of effort into it
haha amazing! did you get shouted at?
Thats really embarassing! did any of your friends poke fun at you for it? 
What happened exactly? Is it just old and moldy?
At least you got your moneys worth! Are you going to have it installed?
That is so lovely
Memories are good to be kept in the medulla. Good old days. You really had a good time
Aw. When you know you know. How did you do it?
I bet it was really special though! Christmas is such a beautiful time of year. When are you getting married?
Thats too bad. Do you have proof of infidelity?
Its good that youre faithful. Too bad your boyfriend couldnt be less flirtatious and respect you more.
What kind of food does it serve? Sounds wonderful!
Surf and turf! Thats what they called a steak served with seafood. Its very yummy!
Thats good I love relaxing outside by a pool.
Thats always a good feeling.
oh man dogs are crazy! My dog killed a cat recently I hope its not poison!! Is he okay?
oh no you are a good dog owner though
Sounds like you are doing all the right things. Did anything go wrong?
Oh that is great! Congratulations on your knew home! That must be so exciting!
thats the coolest thing ever I didnt know you could have them as pets
My kids would love something like that
Monkeys!!!??? I have never heard monkeys howl.  Tell me more.
Where do you live that there are monkeys in the mountains?  I live in Florida the flatlands. lol
Sounds exciting.  But I would have been scared of howling monkeys too.  I am not sure why but the term howling monkeys makes me giggle.
Bye! Watch out for those monkeys!
oh that is so exciting!!! good for you man!
yeah pop that champagne!
That sounds awesome! Whats your favorite part of your vacation so far?
What kinds of fruit do they have there?
Thats great that they let you work in exchange for lessons. I bet you have the best memories.
Thats awesome. Do you own a horse now?
Thats awesome! Yeah I definitely find the more I study the better I do. Funny how that works! 
True. There has to be a workschoollife balance. 
Well I hope he gets to felling better.
You should keep an eye on him older people are more prone to getting sick.
Thats very considerate of you. I know some people that drink it all and dont replace it.
Lol it happens whats important is that you learned and care enough about your people to internalize the knowledge.
Awww I never had one but wanted one.
What were your favorite games?
Wow thats terrible. Did you get him to pay you all back?
Well good riddance. If you never want to see scum again just loan them 20.
Im sorry. It sucks when you put time and effort into studying but the grade is bad. Could you get help from your teacher or a study buddy?
Well thats good news. I hope you do better on your next test.
Aw I know that must be hard having to take care of yourself so far from loved ones that you can depend on.
Thats good that you are keeping your options open and even better that you challenged yourself to leave comfort and travel.
Oh no! thats horrifying in high school! I hope you didnt get made fun of.
Kids can be so mean. Thank God thats all behind us now!
Holy crap! Is there not a landlord or something you can complain to?
Im glad I never had to live with other people. I would not be as patient as you.
Absolutely. Great job!
I completely agree having complete control over your diet is amazing and has a ton of benefits
Yeah and it can be cost effective if you plan wisely!
Oh my goodness! That is scary! Are you alright? Did anyone get hurt?
Whew! You are lucky! Glad to hear everyone was ok. 
Oh no poor dog  Id be devastated too i love dogs so much.
Dont beat yourself up over it it was a very tragic accident but who couldve known. Hes in a better place now.
That was nice of her. Did everything work out?
Oh no! Did you guys stillhave a nice evening?
Yeah I thought of that. well the kids probably loved it!
Very nice.  How many shoes do you have?
Are they all Yeezys?
That sounds so nice!  Are you very far from grocery stores and stuff?
Yeah thats not too bad at all!  Sounds idyllic!
Oh yes.  The first car is amazing
Yes I remember the freedom that comes with the first car.
I feel exactly the same way.  People should be more considerate and be on time for the sake of others.
Yes that would certainly give them a taste of their own medicine!
I agree its something I struggle with as well. Have you tried an diets you liked?
Ive tried a few and I would have to say the one that I liked the most was Weight Watchers. Its pretty easy to stay on and the food is usually good. The only big problem is that it gets expensive.
I see I think you may consider a tylenol or some type of sleep pill for the flight to ensure that you dont feel uncomfortable or paranoid during travel.
Thats awesome. I was always a daddys boy growing up.
Amen. Mine was a good man. He taught me a lot of good life lessons.
I am sorry your dog passed away I totally understand wanting to keep a momento to remind you of him. Was he old when he passed?
Im glad you have something that helps keep his memory alive. 
Aw what a sham! Did they give any reason why they hired from the outside?
Well thats a good attitude to have. I dont blame you for being mad. I would be.
Oh man that is exciting! Do you know what kind?
Thats awesome!! I love jeeps!  congratulations thats great news!
Thats so sweet.  What kind of bird is it?
Aww Id love to see a video of that.
Youre lucky the cow didnt hurt you.
Good thing you listened to your gut feeling
Hopefully it will stop soon. Thats the worst having to get creative with the little food you have on hand.
Well that is what they get paid for. Just be sure to tip him well.
Uh oh. I bet he knew he was in trouble. Did you get him a crate?
Yeah Im glad you didnt do anything you would regret. I hope he is better for you in the future.
Oh no! Im so sorry about that. Dont blame yourself animals like to play with each other!
That sounds like a good plan. You definitely dont want that to happen again. Sometimes bad things happen in order for us to learn and avoid it again.
That sounds great I can remeber going fishing with my dad at that age. Did your 4 yearold have a good time?
Wow thats impressive! Im glad he had a good time.
Poor doggy! Did you have to take him to the vet?
I bet he did Im glad hes okay though.
Thats really nice you have a friend like that.Thats hard to come by. I hope everything is better for you now.
Im sure he doesnt expect it but thats a really nice thing he did.
I hope you arent and Im not too! It would be rough living on the streets.
It would be terrible in the winter.  I cant imagine sleeping outside when its freezing
That sounds fun! Where did you go?
Mmmmm I love greek food! That sounds appetizing! I think I will take my girl there too this week!
Im so sorry you feel that way. Maybe you should talk to someone you trust. A family member or a friend.
Im sorry. You could seek out a professional to talk to. Or you could just try meeting some new people.
What kinds of pets do you have?
oh wow! you did say a ton! I love animals too. wish I lived somewhere I could have more.
Did he have superpowers?
Thats pretty impressive.
Oh wow are you going to be in front of anyone important?
Usually you are the one who notices it the most. 
wow that must be an interesting thing to be involved with. lots of milk too i presume.
very cool wish i could get into something like that. sounds fun
Awww I understand. Dogs are sooo great to be around and they are super friendly. 
Maybe also looking into getting a new dog I know its hard but you can get through it! Your friends and family are always there as well.
That sounds like such an enjoyable life. If only it was so easy!
Haha that is true. But we have to make the most of this one. 
Oh man heart breaker. Thats good yall are friends though. You never know maybe one day yall will be married
you dont still have any feelings at all for her?
Ooh Ive always wanted to learn how to do that. You must be so excited!
Omg that would be awesome. I might just have to learn how to do that myself.
Ooo! Thats exciting! Congrats on your baby! I hope your guests enjoy their time. 
Yay! That sounds like so much fun. Baby showers are a great way to bring everyone together.
Usually it will let you know if something is wrong. Part of how we are designed! 
It is everything has to be balanced just right or else we feel it.
Oh no how did you make things right with the manager. I am sure he is just wanting to get paid. 
That is a tough spot to be in maybe you could of washed dishes for him. Or give him your phone for collateral. 
That is good such an embarrassing situation to be in.
Oh man I want that too! did you get it?
Do you use your computer?
How much do they go for?
thats not bad. I have a rx 280 
Moving is always such a pain. Did it go smoothly at least?
Thats good glad he wasnt having too tough a time.
Oh man I cant stand barking dogs. I wish owners would do something to shut them up. 
That can make it so hard to sleep at night. 
Aw man childhood is full of good memories! I love the smell of strawberries. 
Haha clearly strawberry. Sounds like you had an enjoyable childhood! 
Your neighbor doesnt do anything about his dogs?
If it were me Id call the animal shelter and report possible abuse since the dog does nothing but bark all day  poor thing just needs attention and the owner isnt taking care of it.
Really depends on the person I think. You cant have good people without bad people.
You are very lucky my friend. There are so many children out there that cannot say the same sadly. But so happy for you!
I guess it all comes down to karma if you believe in that stuff...... I do. 
Its good to have a partner. 
I have a son its definitely nice to have some peace and quiet.
You must have been very happy when they returned home.
Did you get it?
Thats disappointing. I feel sorry for you. 
That sounds like a bummer. Hopefully you did not lose too much.
Yeah but it is a good thing to hear you did not lose too much. Some people put all the money on the line.
Hey thats awesome! I hope you get it. When do you hear?
Well I hope you do. What kind of job is it?
You must have been relieved you were able to help. Did all go as plan?
Thats awesome! Im glad it went through without a hitch!
Oh thats terrific! What a great feeling that is to be appreciated and valued!
Oh I love that you are so happy for her! You sound like such a supportive and loving partner!
I also have two older puppies training takes time and care and love.
Puppies are smart believe it or not use treats and dont yell or punish for their mistakes. A change of tone and placing them outside works really well.
i remember the lite brite toy. it was a nice toy to have.
i agree the toys now days are made cheaply and of poor quality. everything is about video games. 
Moving can be stressful for sure hopefully you had some help?
Its like christmas! only you already know whats in the boxes. the best part about moving is you can have a fresh start on organization. 
Thats not good!  What did you do to try to get him to listen again?
I bet that worked!
Oh man im about to eat dinner over here! lol thats pretty gross. My cat pukes up stuff all the time so i can kind of relate.
I bet hope the dog is feeling better though.
interesting what was the issue?
oh man that is an issue i hope he grows out of it
I bet you cant wait.  WHere are going for your vacation?
Miami sounds like a great place to go for a vacation.   I wish I was going with you!
That sucks! What were they upset about?
It sounds like a very challenging environment to work in.
Thats exciting! When will she be moving in?
Does she live far away?
That sounds very frustrating.
Hopefully youll able to get it all sorted out soon.  Im sure when its done itll be a beautiful house.
Ive never tried VR but just imagining that is scaring me away from it.
Congrats!  How exciting for you.
Thats a long time to hold out hope.  I bet you were shocked.
It always takes time. Hang in there It will all work out.
I bet so too!  Good luck to you both.
What subject did you choose?
Nice choice. I guess you have good relationship with your brother.
why was the officer yelling at her?
wow thats unfortunate. i would feel embarrassed for the lady
Thats so wonderful. I love being cared for when I am ill.
It is an amazing thing to have a loving mother. Everyone should show more appreciation to their moms.
Sorry about that you could have taken a taxi
good enough you got home safe
Did you have a good childhood? You must miss a lot of things.
Yes. Nostalgia is unavoidable when we look back on our youth.
Thats unfortunate. But at least you learned from the experience right?
No need to feel ashamed. We all make mistakes and at least you learned your lesson.
Thats nice that you helped him. Im sure he appreciated it!
Yes it really does. I am sure if you get sick he will remember and do the same for you!
Wow! Were you hurt? Was anyone else hurt?
Thats good news at least. I hope you are feeling better now. And dont be hard on yourself accidents happen.
Oh thats great its awesome when the kids go off to school each year.
Youll get used to it and begin to appreciate your quiet time haha.
WalMart is a place where weirdness always happens. Can you tell me what happened Im dying to know!
Do you think he was panhandling you for money or a person who really needed it? Did you give him money?
That must have been a very windy day!
I bet It will teach you.
I go to church every Sunday I love it.
The people you can meet are super.
That is really not thing. I wish more people would do such nice thing. I know that made your day.
So you dont like to be alone. I am so sorry that affects you. So what would you do? 
Yes usually when one relocates its hard to make new friends but eventually it will happen.
That was really nice of your old friends.
Happy birthday. What was your favorite gift?
Nice. What brand of shoes were they?
Thats terrible. Were you able to identify the kid?
Im glad he was able to catch him.
Wow how was it? I have never seen that trailer. 
Aww that is so sad to hear. He must have made some great movies! 
Are they twins?!
Awww! Twins seem like a handful but also very exciting at the same time!
Oh Im sorry. What happened?
I can imagine that you did want to run and hide. Sometimes husbands get us into all kinds of situations.
Ive been in that situation before. Did she find out about it? 
Well thats all that matters. If she was okay with it. Im sure she was happy watching the episodes with you even if you had already watched them. 
That sounds like a bit of work. Are you adjusting to your place now?
Thats whats most important. Im glad everything has gone well.
Oh Im sorry. Why didnt you get to go with him?
Oh thats too bad. I know exactly how you feel. Hopefully your husband will watch your son another night so you can go have some fun. 
Thats great but you dont have to wear a fancy dress to be beautiful. Im sure youre gorgeous no matter what you wear!
Its ok just try your best to remind yourself how beautiful you are and practice selfcare as a habit.
What a great feeling! You must love your dog.
She sounds like a great companion.
Are you looking forward to it?
Exciting! Im sure youll do fine.
Wow thats no good. I hope they get it worked out soon.
I cant play those kinds of games. Too spooky for me.
That would keep me up at night.
Oh my gosh thats insane. Well Im sure youll be able to control your impulses in the future. 
Ive been there before too. The important thing to remember is that there is always another chance to make it right tomorrow. 
Aww sounds like he is teaching the puppy. Thats so sweet.
Yeah sounds like a pretty smart pup.
I do understand I have a son myself. You just need to be patient and continue trying.
That is awesome. I am proud of him 
gotta risk it for the biscuit
 i feel ya but sometimes temptation is good gets the heart pumping
It can be nerve wrecking. Im sure you will do fine though! Have confidence!
You know they say imagine them in their underwear...I wonder that really works. Im not fond of public speaking either.
Did you spend a lot of the time on the project?
I wouldnt get discouraged.  Maybe talk to your boss and see what you can improve on next time.  Im sure at least if you have a good boss they will want you to succeed and guide you in how to do better.
Nice! Enjoy it! I like living alone. It is so peaceful! I get lonely somtimes but for the most part it is great!
Yeah but they are all just a phone call away. Keep your head up your girlfriend will be there soon!
Oh I know mine too! I love how all the colors change with the setting sun.
It reminds you of how beautiful life is.
Wow thats rude! He wont last long...
Yeah some nerve on that guy. He should be grateful to have a job!
Oh wow! Congrats!! How exciting!! How far along is she?
LOL Right!!! Its way too hot to be pregnant right now!
You are so awesome!!! I wish I had  sister like you when I was pregnant.
Ive been in that situation before!  It can be scary
Im glad it worked out in the end!  I wish people would be more careful with their dogs.
Oh no. Did you take it back or keep it
The store might not take it back at this point if it has been to long. 
That sounds beautiful! What emotions did they bring out of you?
Im sorry! What a lovely memory to have of her though. Its good to still have things in your life that remind you of her.
Oh no! Thats so sad. Im so sorry I know you must feel like crap.
I understand completely. I have things of my grandfathers that I can never replace.
Sweet! Where did you go?
That would be awesome to have the whole lake to yourself! My guess is the weather was nice too if you guys got to use the boat most days!
Ive had similar experiences.  What do you end up doing?
Have you ever had a positive experience from that cycle?
oh no! hope all is well with your dog.
Good to read. Always great to find a vet you can trust. Looks like you did. 
BBQ sounds so good right now! How was it?
Well thats kind of disappointing. Its always a let down when you go out and it isnt is good as you were hoping.
i completely agree. though im remote so i am never sitting in the same room as others so i can distract myself 
lol. it kinda is. i moved about 3 hours south of my office a few years ago and since even at the office my work involves connecting to remote data centers it hasnt changed my job any. 
Thats terrible! What did you do?
Thats good. Im glad your alright.
Oh no! Thats so sad. You mustve been so upset. 
Hopefully you didnt and hopefully the other kids didnt make fun of you
Oh I bet! My husband wants an older car when we can afford it
OH NO! I would be devastated. Did he pass or missing?
I am so sorry. I am sure you are. I would be devastated if I was in your shoes. Does she have a chip? Maybe someone will get her to a vet office.
Good job! How do you think you did on it?
That is a good feeling. Time to celebrate before the grind starts all over!
Yeah I like going straight to the point too
I like when I get places earlier than expected
I understand that completely! Did you have to get any work done?
That sounds scary! I always avoid going to the dentist until I absolutely have to. I know thats pretty bad!
Oh no! I hate when that happens. Was he afraid or just didnt want to sleep?
Ugh thats the worst. That happens a lot with my son as well. Hopefully he wasnt too cranky today!
That is wonderful! You must be happy shows that he is getting bigger soon it will be college 
College is when the tear will start to flow. I love children.
That will be fun. What a great way to relax and unwind
I saw the weather forecast. We only have a 20 chance of rain so you know how it is here. Well be good.
That must be hard to do he wants to be beside you. He is going to miss you.
Yes he needs to so you would have to ignore him at nights.
That is so sweet. What is her name?
I can just imagine she sleeps in your bed sometimes. I love dogs I would like to have a dog someday.
That is very cute the little one probably couldnt hold its bladder as long. 
That was very smart of him maybe he remembers back to his puppy days.
Thats good. How is it going?
Thats great news! It sounds like he is enjoying his new freedom and was ready for it. 
Im glad you didnt hit the dog!  Did he jump out at you suddenly?
I live out in a rural area where people dont always have control of their dogs.  Sometimes those little anklebiting dogs will start chasing the car and they make a break for the car and it makes one really fearful that youll hit them.
lol guess you were pretty hungry
yeah might wanna go replace it
That sounds amazing. Whats your favorite beach to go to?
Those are the best. Especially the white sand crystal clear water beaches.
i sure it was beautiful
really i wouldve never thought that. i have a friend who is in Dubai on a teaching assignment
yuck how gross!!
lol right they could easily be your neighbors dinner
Oh my gosh I am so sorry for your family.
Im sure she can with all the technology and modern medicine now. Shes got this!!
why do you live so far from family
i would like a new life. i totally understand
what? that scary
wow a hard lesson
I understand!  I live in the country and have the same problem.
Yes.  The only company available out here is Century Link and they just crash randomly all the time.
That is very cool. What took you all around the world? What was your favourite place?
What interesting stories you must have! I think that would be really neat but settling down is probably good too. 
That is so sad.  I hate it when pets die.
yes.  they do like to have lots of  babies
I am going on a trip to Peru to visit Machu Picchu! I cant sleep because of the anticipation!
I hear it is a very spiritual place to be and full of beauty and history.
Yes my friends are coming with me. 
Congrats! Did you do it because of football season?
Cool! Whats your favoirite? I like the office.
I have never heard of Mr. Robot actually.
Same here! I am glad you are doing well! 
I hope these feelings last for you!
A puppy!  Thats so exciting!  Are you going to keep it?
I dont know that I would be able to give it up.  4 is a lot but whats one more?
Well Im sure he will be most guys are. Id never get to  do anything if my girlfriend didnt trust me.
Everyone gets jealous It when you act on unfounded stuff that is the issue.
Yes sometimes people do stick their noses in where they do not belong
Yes.  Especially men who want to mansplain things to you.
Wow!  How much did he win?
That is awesome that he gave it away!  Maybe good karma will let him win again.
Good choice. You could have broken down and never made it to school.
HAHA! You are super lucky you are smart. Lol
Everyone handles stress differently. My anxiety gets so High I sometimes cancel my plans.
I go to a psychiatrist and take meds It just fixes what your body doesnt make or do properly. It helps so much. 
Oh no! It will be ok. It seems everyone in life has to go through that at least once. Everyone gets through it!
Sometimes you need those times to make your realize how special having a job is. Gives you perspective.
I hope everything is fine How did it turn out?
Im happy to hear that a sick child is always a scary thing.
Neat. Where are you going?
Sounds exciting. Have fun.
Oh wow are you feeling super envious?
Ha ha I dont blame you! Hopefully you can get the car you want soon though.
I m glad to here it will be fine  but what was wrong with it?
I m glad you was able to pin point the problem and I hope he stays in good health.
Wow thats so mean of them to laugh at you! At least someone pointed it out eventually right? 
Thats embarrasing. But hey I think the best way to get over moments like those is to just laugh at yourself! Dont beat yourself up for it. 
Wonderful I bet she is really content if everything is perfect. Love to hear that someone is doing well.
I understand but try not to be jealous. Good things will come to you to in its own time
The waiting must be very difficult and nerve wracking.
Things like that make me antsy.
A new haircut can do wonders! I always feel like a million bucks after.
I bet you looked great! Those compliments wouldve made me feel good too!
Oh? What specifically were you talking to her about?
Haha! Well as we mature we learn so much more about ourselves.
Haha you are a good father. I hope you can make it through it!
Oh my gosh! Im sorry! haha Thats funny. Atleast you have them a story to always remember.
Oh no! So what did you do?!
Thats nice of your neighbor! Your boyfriend shouldve told you that there was no toothpaste earlier. Maybe there wouldve been time to get some. But at least you didnt go to work with stinky breath right?
Haha everyone has to do that once. Can you tell me a great story about the party?
Hahaha thats funny. I hope you guys are still on good terms. To be honest little holes sounds like an easy fix.
Wow cool. Maybe you can ask to tag along?
Thats too bad. Well at least you have something to work towards and plan as a goal for yourself.
Thats amazing! How old is she?
Wow that mustve been a big thing for both of you.
I am sorry I do not know what nclex is but I wish you good luck
O ok I hope that everything works out for you 
Wow! Did you try to get it out?
Thats amazing! He probably loves you so much
Do you feel nice and refreshed though?
I did the same thing today so you are not alone in your behavior friend!
Oh no! Did it break?
Oh that really stinks. I hope you were able to get another one.
Did you do some neat doctor stuff on it?
Oh yea that sounds like you did a good job!
That is good how long did it take before you go him to this point?
Yeah i understand it is good that you took him there though
Wow they must be doing well. Why dont you try to get one?
sounds wasteful to me. life isnt about material things anyway. 
Yeah sometimes kids say things that they really dont mean in the heat of the momment
well maybe you guys should talk
Ugh my neighbors do that sometimes. Its the worst! I think some things should not be allowed to be cooked unless you live alone.
Ick. Hopefully the smell is fully gone now
Oh that is the worst feeling! I hate using the restroom in public as is. 
Maybe.  For me I just dont want to cause a stranger to be embarassed lol
I am with you i like it a lot more than summer personally
I feel that I hate being hot. In the winter I can be comfy and I can always just put on a jacket if I get too cold but in the summer it is not that easy.
I was very nervous. I did not know if I would pass or not.
Did you pass the test?
I am the same way I barely make anything compared to a lot of people I know
I think cities are more expensive like living costs so I do not want to live there ether personally
Im assuming that heshe didnt return it in time. Im sorry.
Oh I understand. Did it bring it to you at all?
That is amazing!  Im really happy for you!
It sounds like you really deserve it!
that does sound terrifying  are you feeling better ?
at least your ok thank god for that
Nice for what position
Thats pretty great you must really take the initiative.  Good job
Youre much braver than me. I would never host a dinner party.. dont feel like Im good at planning and dont feel like Im interesting enough to talk to a bunch of different people.
I think maybe yeah! It depends on whos there and if I felt comfortable with the host. If I felt like I had enough people to kind of rescue me and who I could talk to at the party if I got anxious and couldnt talk to strangers then thatd be alright. Other than that I just kind of do like maybe a group of 4 max
Aw thats too bad. You did the right thing by telling her though.
Maybe you could save up and purchase her a new one.
I am right there with you!  God is good and wow Hes been with me through so much hardship.  Im so happy you feel the same way.
Yes we can always count on Him to know the bigger picture and have faith that Hes working for our good.  Hope you have a blessed day!
They really have changed. I know exactly how you feel and love thinking back to the time.
Those were awesome! My favorite was the coke commercial at Christmas time. So many memories!
Oh fun!  How big was it about?  Did it have neat markings on it?
I think I saw someone post a picture of those online. Maybe it was a lunar moth! What a fun experience!
What is your nieces name?
Thats amazing was it your sisters first baby?
It will be amazing!  I should do that too!
That sounds so great!   I hope your plants grow beautifully!
That sounds like the perfect remedy for feeling down. Getting out in the sun and outside the housebed is so good.  Im sorry youre struggling with depression.  I understand.
I am so glad!  You know what to do to help your body and mind and that is good selfcare.  I try to do that as well as meditate and pray in the morning.  Really refocuses me.  Im glad youre feeling better!
I imagine are you prepared for it?
Oh yes last year with huracan Irma we went without power for 5 days.
Aw did it bring back a lot of good memories for you?
Thats awesome. Sometimes I wish I could be back in my childhood. Maybe if only for a day. ha ha.
I am sure itll be ok. Usually if you stay in contact with them and dont blow them off for a long time it will be OK.
I would call them. They usually give you some credit for that.
Thats good. I assume you have studied hard and are prepared?
Good luck! You will do great!
Haha Im sorry but I had a little laugh at that. It reminded me of the time I did that to my teacher in school. I was embarrassed but it made me feel better to find out that it seems like its a common thing that happens since theyre female authority figures that you can easily mix up.
Yeah she knew what you meant. She probably forgot in two minutes while youve thought about it for much longer. The best thing to do there is to just show off your sense of humor and ability to make fun of yourself and not take yourself too seriously which it sounds like maybe you did.
Thats gross why are they coming in?
You should probably avoid feeding them if you want a clean house.
I sure wish it wasnt. I live far from my family and they cant even make time for me to go to them. So I feel for you it is very sad.
Absolutely first. Especially when you dont live close.
I bet it wasnt Comcast! They wouldnt even give you a cup of water for free.
I am glad you had a nice experience! Its difficult to find such a company that cares about its customers!
Oh wow! That is crazy have you talked to the vet?
I thought it would be normal. Good thing to be cautious. 
Well it is a good thing you unplugged everything!
That is a good lesson to learn early I am glad everything turned out okay for you!
That sounds amazing!  But terrifying too lol
I admire you!  I dont think youll regret getting this experience
Hahah that is funny. Were your parents angry?
Haha did they believe it?
nice what system do you play on?
i really enjoy video games as well
Thats the worst! Have you tried talking to your neighbor?
You might try contacting the authorities though I dont know if it would help. 
thats awesome! its really cool to be able to keep things in the family
did he enjoy the toys
Yeah that can be nerve racking! How did it go?
That is good! Are you guys close now
Good job! Do you feel pretty prepared?
WOWZA! Congrats! Is it a job you can build a career out of.
Oh thats good! Thanks for teaching. 
My mom is one so i know how important you guys are.
Man.. i need some of that luck!
Wow thats awesome! i never win anything like that
I agree! I wish I was able to make things
For sure you are born with those types of talents!
That is cool! I love flash backs from the past especially when it comes to television. I sometimes watch old shows on youtube that I used to watch as a kid. Love it!
I used to watch the Wonder Years after school. I love watching it until this very day. 
that must have been embarrassing I hope you werent to traumatized
that is good to hear it was a motivation to succeed a great character building 
Aw man that sucks. It must have been a crazy storm.
You shouldnt think about death whilst youre alive! Just live each day to the fullest. 
Yes but death comes to all of us someday. So I think its best we enjoy our life whilst we are blessed with it. 
That is a good test of friendship.  Did he keep his word?
It is such a blessing to have good friends on whom you can depend.  
Nice! I hope you get it Ill cross my fingers for you also! Do you think you got a good chance?
Thats all you can do but if you worked hard Im sure you will get it!
Oh cool. Were there any good picture in there?
Well thats nice. I am glad they were happy memories for you. 
Oh boy.  Ive gotten quite a few of those before.  New hairstylist?
Thats odd.  I wouldve told him so and asked for my money back. 
Ohhhh disgusting.  What did you do?
I bet what a terrible feeling!
Oh man your making it even worse.  I never even thought about that.  Now I want to throw up.
is there anything that you can do to help prepare yourself?
yeah i can understand that!! id want to get it over with too. the sooner the better
Oh my I hope that doesnt mean more workload for you.
Maybe you should ask for overtime pay just in case you do get more work!
Yeah flying can be scary.
Hopefully it isnt a long flight.
thats awesome that you trust her
its hard to find good people you can trust with your kids nowadays
Oh no! Thats horrible. Were you driving?
Oh Gosh that is horrible. I am so sorry that happened to you.
Thats the worst! Because now youll be freaking out trying to think of the things you may not even remember whether or not could have been there. That must be an anxious feeling. 
Yeah Im not quite a hoarder or a packrat when it comes to those things but I do get sentimental with some physical objects. If I lost them Id feel like it would be an itch I couldnt scratch because I couldnt replace what I lost. Hopefully you can work past it somehow.
Oh man thats the best feeling in the world. Getting out of a shower especially if its into clean freshly laundered sheets.
Its such a wonderful feeling I should take a shower soon too.
How did you you go over your budget?
I hope you can have better selfcontrol in the future.
awww. that is good news!
how long has it been seen youve seen each other?
Oh gosg. Do you have some greedy roommates or something?
Hahahaa good point. Maybe try hiding your groceries.
yea i have
thats great happy for yo
literally me right now actually
must be nice to have someone that loves you
What is going on with your work?
You can do better next time I believe in you!
Oh I see.  Very interesting that your faith makes you want to die though.
its not so bad it can be intimidating but you just need to figure out the campus layout and classes but its very smooth from there
once you figure the way it just becomes routine
You are so right did you read that somewhere?
That is cool have you studied any philosophy in school?
Yes I feel that every day.
I wish people understood how precious life really is.
Why did you throw your laptop?
Sometimes I lose my temper like that too.
wow thats vivid what game was this?
ah yes league love hate relationship with that game but after 4 years it can really still tilt me more and more
Oh no I hope it wasnt an important meeting.
Sorry to hear that were they understanding about it?
Im sorry your wife is sick.  What kind of soup is it?
That sounds quite delicious if I must say.
Yeah.  reminds me of the good old days!  
Yeah same here.  I remember one time awhile back I took some pictures of when the aliens landed in my backyard.   That was some good times!
Yikes thats a tough one and I can definitely feel your pain on the job market. I think either network your way to a higher pay job depends on connections or possibly go back to school to a doctorate or certain specialist degrees.
Yes but the market is quite flooded with CS degree holders. Its hard to get something unless you are specialized I think. Unfortunately I dont see society changing any time soon.
Life is the most beautiful thing.
I live every day like its my last.
Waiting in line is the worst.
I hope you got your classes.
Sounds like you are pretty confident in yourself!
I agree that it is as well. In most situations it can work to ones benefit.
I dont understand what you are trying to tell me. Is this a joke?
Why would they want to do that?
I can imagine the flood of emotions.
I hope it was worth visiting.
Sounds like you are prepared. I like the confident attitude. Go get them!
I would love to come with you to yours. LOL I just invited myself.
I completely understand. Maybe you need a vacation to recharge the batteries.
Are you looking for a new job?
Thats not true Im sure. Do you have any friends to hang out with?
I can understand. Maybe connect with some likeminded people online? 
ewww thats gross!  Did you help clean it up?  And what was in that pizza anyway??
He seems like a good friend.  
The future certainly can be scary.
I am curious for what the future holds.
Oh wow the whole cake? Has she found out yet? Was she mad?
If you can and have time Id try to get a quick replacement and explain to her. Maybe shell understand.
Oh cool.  How does it work?
Oh thats easy peasy.  Sometimes I only have to wipe once when I go number 2.  
Oh man I would be so jealous. When will it be your turn? 
I think your boss should give you more recognition in that case!
Thats good!  Youre awesome!  Family is what is important
ready for all those ice breakers? those amazing crazy party? what are you hoping to do this year?
yeah defiantly my best advice to you is to learn and focus on your studying and always expand in knowledge thats the one thing we seniors always wish we had done   
what? what happend? why are you angry?
really? was it about something very stupid?
I think thats a kind of natural reaction especially if it is just a hobby. I would have a fear of being judged.
Definitely. I feel the same speaking foreign languages. Its more of a selfconscious thing.
that does sound like fun! where do you guys plan on going?
that sounds like a good time. not the usual country you see people vacation to
Thats awesome! Its so good that you have such a positive outlook on everything.
I think you have the perfect outlook. I hope I can strive to maintain something like that as well.
what did he do yolo?
this is absolutely the worst! he is no man in my eyes!
Oh yuck! Thats gross. Did you get sick too?
thats rough! My husband always did with the kids when he was home.
dont be! i know this is overused but trust me its not as hard as everyone else makes it to be if you focus and aim for your goals you will get it! i know you can do it!
dont be i am sure your fiance will always be right next to you and help you out
It really is what can we do to help?
Thatd be a good idea we could all start biking.
What was the project?1
You must be an expert on nutrition then!
What are you looking forward too?
Which country? that sounds fun are you guys doing anything fun there?
yeah. it would be best to check the website for a list of approved items
yes. hopefully all will go well
Are you his best man?
I hope he does being the best man is an honour and youre ready for it.
sounds quite interesting to code
oh dang i never really dabbled that deep when i did my small share of programming
I hope all goes well so youre as happy as possible.
Thats good! I hope you had a good time?
Yes its great when you run into an old friend you havent saw for a long time. 
What are you planning on doing with it?
That sounds so admirable Id love to see you grow to an amazing person.
why dont you go get yourself some food? or just order some?
oh god i get you! waiting for your food to arrive is real torture.
wow spooky what did you do next?
that must have startled you 
You having money problems?
I dont think Ive ever had a delivery guy be that late. Id be mad.
Oh that stinks...literally! I have pets too so I know how you feel. My cat will eat too much sometimes and throw up!
It is I wished they could just use the toilet like we do!
thats good! nothing wrong with hard work and dedication
that does have to feel really good
Yes where do you live?
I love Colorado. I visit all the time.
Yeah we have a lot to be thankful for.  We take for granted many of the perks of being a US resident!
I agree. There is a lot of suffering.  I am glad people like you and I recognize that.
That is great. Where are you selling your popsicle?
I understand. Good luck.
You were probably just being you.
Haha! Thats usually the case.  
I understand. Is your family living far from New York?
It is always cool to have family and friends close by.
That is a great mindset to have!  You must feel very happy and content!
Why do cities make you feel that way?
Oh no.. and no one really likes pumping gas. 
You could grab it when shes done with it and fill it up real quick for her! 
Did you give it back or just walk away?
Yeah that is a hard one to deal with.  Maybe you should give it back so you will not feel bad about yourself.
I would ask the realtor on some background and even google the address to see if any abuse headlines come from that place. 
Kinda makes you think even more since its such a good deal that people are just like get rid of it  deff look into it! 
Im sorry to hear that...sometime you just have stop and take a deep breathe so you dont get overwhelmed.
Therapy is a good thing. Its is nothing to be ashamed of.
Maybe it isnt your body but also your partners! Something to check into to see which end its coming from but none the less it will happen! 
Its hard to trust anything even the oatmeal recently was put on the news that its high in cancer causing pest spray. 
Thats kind of you did everything go well when you put it back into the wild? 
Sounds like it went well! 
Yes I hate those kind of people. They have nothing to do expect lying about other people.
I just ignore them. At some point they stop but they understand that it is not working.
Im sorry to hear that. I hope he is feeling better. 
It is. Taking care of sick child is hard. Missing work is also hard. The things we have to do for our children.
Sounds like something on a movie! What a work day right my god. Bring extras next time? lol 
I bet they were lol atleast you can laugh about it now. 
Thats very sad has he considered getting help for his addiction?
I can certainly understand your feelings I hope he can somehow fix his habits.
Has it been a lot of fun?
Oh yeah I remember those old Halo days too during my childhood such a great game.
I understand that feeling. It wouldnt make sense for us all to want to do the same things especially if youve partied before already.
Thats cool that you know what you want from life right now and that you dont feel obligated to do things just because of norms.
Oh thats great! Does it come with a nice raise?
Do you kind of feel like theres no where else to go?
I am so happy for you! All of your hard work paid off!
That is great accomplishment! I wish you well on your new path in life!
Oh my...I hope you didnt hurt yourself.
Since you didnt hurt yourself I think I will have to laugh. It sounds like it was funny.
Yea I feel the same way.  Its worse when you have to pass by them twice a day.
Heck no.  Be envious that they were lucky enough to have their parents hand down all their money to them.
Oooh how exciting!! What kind of car did you get?
Ill bet it is! Best of luck with your new truck!
In the 6th grade? Where is this school?
Makes sense. I live in the states. We have no money for such things.
How big a bird was this. I dont remember anything from the 6th grade.
Wow!! Thats crazy. Im like that though. I never win anything either
haha right! Maybe you should buy a few and see what happens. You cant win if you dont play
Oh god I am so sorry. Is he okay now?
I hate to hear that. It is so hard to lose a pet. I hope you are doing okay through this.
Do you not fly often? It isnt too bad.
Well if it is a bigger plane it isnt as bad. Just bring some headphones and listen to some comforting music.
You have to be more careful next time maybe you need a calendar to remind you.
I am so sorry to hear I am glad that it didnt cause a lasting effect.
That is a fantastic feeling. I hope you get it.
Keep riding that confidence. It will get you places. It sounds like you deserve it.
That must have been a bit scary You should have called the police.
You cannot be too careful these days i am so sorry that happened to you.
Okay! Now that is interested I would love to see them.
Oh really? I will be checking it out. I would love to have some.
Free? That makes it even better I will be getting me some posters.
I hope so too. Thank you so much!
I am afraid of spiders. I would run and scream. What happened afterwards?
I would move out of that room. Maybe you need to spray the area.
Oh no! Did it end up raining? Did you take rain gear?
That sounds like it was a lot of fun!
Im sorry to hear that it can be hard 
Yeah i would get a pet
That is so sweet of you. I love cats you must be a caring spouse.
The cat didnt like you oh dear. I am so sorry that happened. You need to spend more time with the cat.
I have heard that is a common side effect but you might want to talk to your doctor about it
Well you could always work out and turn it into muscle
Its a good guard dog then
What kind of dog is he
Animal accidents can be really bad!
At least no one else was injured but it is sad about the cow. 
Just cherish the moments
It will be okay
That is a nice job I am sure
Uh oh! Did you get in trouble?
That is good that you gave it back and were able to admit your mistake. I am sure they appreciate that.
Awesome congrats! Im not too familiar with the Oculus Rift is there a particular game youre eager to play?
Robot games are always fun. I bet youll have a great time!
Ooh how so? Were there a lot of hills and sharp turns?
I see. Do you think youll be going back on that bike trail?
I hope you have tons of fun and enjoy a safe trip!
What kind of con was it
that is really cool! I like in Texas so i cant go to stuff like that
That sounds amazing!  How did everyone do?
Awesome!  Hopefully what you guys learned in the ropes course translates over into the workplace.
Why did you do tht?
That makes sense you are a good older sibling!
I would imagine that is a lot to drink!
I get that well I hope you feel betternow!
I get that did your friends know how to ride bikes?
Well it is never hard to learn if you give it a shot
Aww thats sweet. Did you cry?
Why hold them back? It okay to cry lol
Oh I am so sorry! I used to have a dog we loved so much who had diabetes...we gave him insulin shots twice a day but we lost him. I can relate to how you feel... 
Our pets are our family...its not easy to see them suffer..I feel for you. And thank you about our dog.
That is terrible you must have been devastated  I hope he find the help heshe needs.
Oh dear but are you allowed to sing at work? That must be so annoying.
He needs to just sing in the shower. Tell him to quit singing.
Haha no way I thought that only happens in cartoons!
Im sorry but I probably would have too. Hopefully you didnt get hurt though!
That is unfortunate is he doing any chemotherapy ?
Well I hope everything works out for him!
What were you waiting for!
Nice!  The anticipation must have been killing you!
How well did it work out for you?
Wow!  That is such a great feeling!  I love when good memories come back to me!
o no what did you do?
o no im not sure that was the best response
Oh No! Did you get hurt?
I bet that was a little embarrassing. 
Dont be embarrassed. You know that you had a problem and you are better now for it
Thats understandable. I wish you the best in staying smoke free!
That is great to hear that things are going well for you.
I am sure that things will continue to go smooth since you have a positive attitude about it.
How long has it been since the interview?
Oh well congrats and good job!
Oh that is awesome for your friend!
Yeah I can understand that. I would feel the same.
That was probably not a good idea how did it go for you?
Well you never know if you can do something till you try. I am glad you were able to do so well.
That can be kind of scary. How did it go?
Awesome congratulations! It just goes to show how great things can happen when youre prepared.
Good job.  Your coworker sounds like a shady little bch did you let himher know whats up
For real.  Glad you had enough selfrespect to handle it most people dont
Aww haha how many bags did you bring
Heey there you go...sounds like youre the resourceful one
Have you tried talking to them about it?
I dont think that I have seenheard one of those since the 90s... Possibly the early 2000s at the earliest! Crazy I didnt know that they still exist either!
I loved that too!
That is wonderful to hear good for you. Theres way too much craziness in the world making people unhappy. Its nice to hear someone is doing well and happy.
Distancing yourself from the negative things sounds like a totally healthy way to insulate yourself from that stuff.
Aw that must have brought up a lot of nostalgia for you. 
Did you share it with anyone else?
Nice a step up is always such a relief. Do you feel confident youll get the job?
Well I hope you get it. Good luck!
Thats great. How long are you going to have to wait?
I am glad you are so confident about your prospects. I hope you hear something very soon from them.
I think weve all been there...Ive done my fair share of dumbassery
I know right! I noticed leaves on the ground the other day and got all excited! Is autumn your favorite season too?
I dont mind winter either but youre so right the temperature is just right during fall.
Awe sorry to hear that. I am sure you did better than you think.
That is a good attitude. Better luck next time!
I was doing the same thing!  Hard work but so satisfying when you see the results!  Who is coming to stay?
I completely agree.  Mine can get trashed in 10 minutes flat from the kids.  ha ha. Oh how fun!  I hope you have a wonderful time!  Yeah youll probably be cleaning all over again by the end of it but its worth it.
That sounds pretty disturbing.  Have you called the cops?
I bet.  I wonder what he is thinking.
I certainly hope so  Why do you want to move?
That sounds great That is how I like my houses to be too.
Hmm dont you need fat and protein in your diet also?
Oh I hadnt even thought of avocado. Well good luck with the diet I hope it works for you!
Oh wow! That is a brave thing to do! Your letter must have been a little intense if you are worried how they will take it. How did it work out?
Awe that is great! I am glad there was a happy ending!
Oh man Id be mad too...you should wait outside with a paintball gun 
Yup gotta lay down the law
Terrifying! What was it?
Oh good. I bet!  I wouldnt have been able to go back to sleep after that!  Do you have to replace the pump?
Oops. I hate when that happens. Did they say anything to you?
That was really nice of you to apologize like that. Some people would have just ignored it. I know that could have been embarrassing.
that sounds exciting! Do you bike a lot?
Doesnt sound corny. We all need a hobby to relieve stress!
How come you cant take them anymore?
Awww well maybe youll have grandchildren that you can take one day!
Thats intense. I hope you did well!
Congratulations! Thats great news. Well deserved
I totally understand. The same thing happened to me last week. I thought I was going to lose it!
Right I had to end up calling the homeowners association on them
Wow that is very clever. I would have never thought that could happen.
That is incredible. I wonder what else you can train him to do.
That is great! Hopefully he continues to be
Lol im sure you have to put up with him as well so its even
Oh no. Thats so sad. Was she sick for long?
Im sorry. At least she had a good long life.
That is awful! Did you have insurance to cover everything?
Yeah that is horrible. I am sorry that happened to you. 
Oh no! I hope you didnt get into too much trouble by doing so!
To be fair everybody makes mistakes and its bound to happen even to the best of us!
Sounds like that could be fun if you like your brother and if you like parties. Do you want to go?
Happy Birthday! Im glad you were able to have fun and be surrounded by those that love you.
What was her reaction to that
That sounds like some nice relaxing quality time
Have you ever passed out together watching tv?
How old is your baby?
And how long have you been married?
that is exciting! will it be your first house?
that is no good! hopefully yall will find a better one
You must really trust your friend! How did that turn out?
Good to hear that it went so well. Do you think youll let your friend watch him again?
Dont worry from what you said it doesnt sound like you almost ruined it. It wasnt something on purpose at least.
Lol that makes a lot of sense?
well that sounds fun!
Haha caught red handed!
Yeah I wonder what their bathrooms are like if thats their service
Dont worry about it you will do fine. Kindergarten isnt too hard. Just dont eat the glue.
Oh I see. My mistake. I was wondering how you could type and spell so well for a 6 year old. Well good luck in college!
Did he try to get another diploma in this profession area?
That is a good news. I hope he get it.
Surgery on my kids always scares me but I have heard that it is best to have them taken out while they are young
I understand when it comes to our kids and being worried about them it feels like time stand still
Oh for sure. I hate having to cook and do dishes after a long hard day
Were at work today or doing something else?
Interesting. How do you feel about it? Do you find it fun and interesting or wish she were more responsible with her money?
Yeah I can understand that. Sometimes when youre not in a position to enjoy yourself because youre busy being tied down with responsibilities its easy to get mad at others. Whatever you can do to spin it positively I would suggest that. Being negative about it will only make everyones lives worse.
Oh my gosh!  That had to be super scary!
Yeah thank god you are safe.  I dont know what I would have done if that happened to me.
Yep I thinks its disrespectful and petty. What happened? 
Thats good. I am amazed by people who think its okay to do that. 
Sounds like your co workers respect you then
Or that as well ha
Did you ever get caught?
Was she disappointed?
How many month earlier he came?
Is he healthy?
whatwas the exam for?
tha is really cool what was your grade
What are they arguing about?
Thats so ridiculous!
seriously the social context in which a person lives is a big influence in selfesteem otherwise you can go round and round trying to understand why youre not worthless then go back to the same crowd and be knocked down again 
 feelings of worthlessness is unfortunately common  in fact most people if not all have felt this to some degree at some point in their life 
 id look at finding what is going well in your life and what you can be grateful for  i believe everyone has talents and wants to find their purpose in life 
 when i work with those that are experiencing concerns related to feeling of depression and issues with self esteem  i generally work with my client to help build coping skills to reduce level of depression and to assist with strengthening self esteem by guiding my client with cbt practices 
 you can always change your feelings and change your way of thinking by being open to trying to change  you can always make yourself available to learning new things or volunteering so that you can make a purpose for yourself 
 seek out a counselor who provides ncca temperament therapy and discover the joy of being you  god loves you as you are! 
 depression is a liar  sometimes depression places these glasses over our eyes these dark sunglasses that change how we see things 
 you wrote that you want to fix your issues but never get around to it  i wonder how you are spending your mental and physical energy 
 it takes a lot of courage to reach out  it sounds like you want to get better but perhaps need some help to get over the hump 
 this is the lie that they are living with  the work of therapy is to help people see their true good selves 
 im glad to hear this has not reached the point of suicidal ideation however it does sounds like you could use some additional support right now  i would recommend seeking out counseling to help you challenge the negative beliefs you have about yourself 
 depression can make you feel overwhelmed and paralyzed to change  i would suggest that you connect with a provider who can help you get to the root of where the worthlessness is coming from and help you develop a plan for recovery 
 visiting your doctor is a great first step to address your lack of sleep  first you want to make sure that you are physically healthy and that there isnt a physical condition causing your problem with sleep 
 the sleep should be addressed with a primary carephysician to rule out any physical issues  sleep is the big reset and allows usto function in the day 
please get around to counseling  having someone to listen to you is a gift to yourself 
 depression can cause insomnia and make a person focus on their own perceptions that they are worthless  it is important to remember that other people may not truly perceive you as worthless 
 it sounds like there is a very critical aspect of your self that is alive and taking over  sometimes when we are stuck it is because a part of ourselves a way that perhaps we learned to cope with difficult situations earlier in our lives has decided to run the show 
 improving your self esteem needs focus on that original message from parents teachers or siblings that may be suppressed  most of us need help to uncover the lie because you were born valuable! 
 your comparison to others and you thinking you need to be someone other than who you are  you are not worthless 
 let me see if i can guide you in the right direction  often when i talk to my clients about feelings of worthlessness we start with a little bit of selfexploration 
 we all have narratives that we say to ourselves whether it is valid or not  in your case it would be beneficial to explore when and how this belief began and rewrite your story 
 in fact most people who come to see me for counselling have more than one issue they would like to work on in psychotherapy and most times these are all interconnected  in counselling we work together collaboratively to figure out which issues you would like to address first and then together we develop an individualized plan of care 
 the right time is when you feel ready and open to change  sometimes when we have a history of trauma like sexual abuse the impact of that trauma can affect many areas of our lives as adults 
 regardless of the struggles you have been through you do not have too many issues for counseling  many times when someone starts out their counseling and healing journey there are multiple things they would like to address and work on 
 i strongly recommending working on one issueneed at a time  in therapy you will set smart goals and objectives that will help you reach your goals 
 you would benifit tremendously from counseling! a good therapist will develope a treatment plan that addresses all of your needs  with help you could definitely live a happy life without all of your anxiety and depression getting in the way! 
 in fact that type of thinking may be stopping you from seeking counseling so it may be hindering you from getting the help you need  in fact all of what you described points to the importance of you seeking help in order to cope with the many challenges in your life 
 i hope you are able to find a counselor you feel comfortable working with and do the work if you feel called  best of luck on your journey! 
 it sounds like you have significant trauma and it will continue to impact your depression until it is dealt with  everybody has issues though some more traumatic than others yet it is best to just start somewhere 
 it is normal to have many events in our lives that trouble us and remain with us without counseling help  the right type of counsellor will help you focus on the main and most troubling issue you have first and work your way through all that you are managing step by step goal by goal 
 healing one issue can have a ripple effect and heal other issues as well  
 many issues are often interrelated and can all be worked on with some time and patience  
 there is no such thing as having too many problems for therapy  therapy is great because it will help you process all that you are going through heal from past and present pain and gain clarity 
 you may want to do some research on therapists in your local area who specialize in mindbody connection or one of the struggles you have acknowledged in your post in order to find a therapist that is best suited to meet your needs good luck on your search and remember that the world is a better place with you in it 
 therapy would begin by prioritizing what you feel needs to be addressed first  as one area improves such as processing history of abuse you are likely to see improvement in other areas of your life 
 you are stronger than you may believe at this moment for being able to continue to grow and live through these experiences  take a moment to acknowledge your strength and know that this strength will be an asset during the therapeutic process that you will be able to tap into to find increased self esteem and more strength to address the concerns you are having 
 the most important thing is that you are reaching out to get help  therapy helps you to develop healthier coping strategies and that can help reduce the anxiety and depression as well as improve your sleep 
 seeking counseling can assist you in working on these issues individually as well as ways in which they intersect and impact each other  
 i would venture to guess that several of the things you are feeling symptoms are connected  i would recommend a trauma counselor 
 if you want to work on all the issues youve listed it will just take some dedication on your part to see through the counseling long enough to find a resolution to each of the issues that is satisfactory to you  you work at your own pace in counseling and it does seem like you may be overwhelmed with the evergrowing list 
 participating in counseling with a licensed professional offers a safe place and therapeutic relationship where healing can occur a trained therapist can help a person unpack and process past andor current wounds or events which may negatively impact day to day living 
 many of the issues cited here are connected  for example in this case working on the sexual abuse will possibly address the depression the anxiety the self esteem 
 counseling is a process whereby you and your therapist will help you create goals starting with issues that are most pressing and interfering with your daily functioning  when anxiety and daily stress is more manageable then you and your therapist can examine more deep rooted or more chronic issues 
 in fact counseling can help you understand how most of these things can be related to one another  for example insomnia depression low selfesteem and anxiety are very common to experience after a traumatic event or events 
 the fact that you are wanting to seek help is commendable and you should feel proud of yourself for reaching out for support  i know from my experience working with clients that some may say they have only one issue but when we explore it turns out they have many things that they want to discuss that are of equal importance 
 i imagine it feels overwhelming and discouraging at times if you feel like there are too many issues to address in a counseling session  i would encourage you to share these concerns with a counselor because a counselor can help you organize the concerns into a list of specific goals 
 in a way we take on too many issues at one time  then we become over whelmed with anxiety and depression 
 most people come in with multiple issues they want to address  the wonderful thing about therapy is that often as one or more significant issues begin to change and improve the lead naturally without much effort to improvements in the other areas 
 many of the people i see have multiple issues  these issues are often linked so that helping one issue will positively help the other issues 
 its important to be realistic when entering counseling of any sort and that the therapist be realistic with you about what you might be able to expect working with that person i use the words might be able to expect because therapy experiences can vary  but that not having counseling about trauma that you have experienced much earlier in your life can play a significant role in the process and how long that process could take to unpack all that may have been buried over time 
 these symptoms come about as a result of underlying causes  the obstacles you have been overcoming such as abuse cancer and insomnia likely bring about similar feelings and emotions in you which affect your selfesteem 
 when we think about how much is wrong it can be overwhelming and we may not know where to even start  counseling can provide guidance to help you to begin working toward healing in a way that is most helpful for you to reach your goals 
 i have had clients ask that same question and through more exploration there is often an underlying fear that they cant be helped or that they will be too much for their therapist  i dont know if any of this rings true for you 
 i would suggest that unresolved trauma from sexual abuse is likely a primary contributing factor  however it is important that you first build a trusting relationship with a therapist experienced in trauma treatment as this is an area of specialty that not all therapists are skilled in treating 
 once you start counseling your therapist will help you identify which issues to start working on first and which are causing you the most distress  once you and your therapist prioritize your concerns you can start to address each concern starting with the one causing the most distress for you 
 but you are also a survivor and have the benefit of a long stable marriage  you do not have too many issues to address in counseling 
 whether a person comes to therapy with many issues on their heart and mind or whether heshe comes with something specific one issue leads to another  please dont feel as though you have too many issues 
 and your perseverance will serve you well if you choose to engage in therapy  the trauma and medical event you experienced topped off with chronic sleepless nights would lead to feelings of depression for many 
 you do not have too many issues to address in counseling  it will help to prioritize what you would like to work on first in therapy 
 remember therapy is about you not your therapist  you bring whatever you need to bring to the table 
 your reaching out to ask this question shows you have a resilient spirit  also your happy marriage can be a support and strength to you as you embark on a counseling journey 
 if a client came to me for help with the same issues that you have listed here i would first want them to meet with their doctor to get a physical to rule out any biological causes to your depression anxiety and insomnia  i would work with you on deciding which of these issues to tackle first 
 once you work on one issue it will have a positive effect on all areas  slowly each issue is addressed and actually less issues will need to be addressed directly since resolving one helps your overall wellness 
 there is a lot of anxiety in going to counseling for the first time  this is normal 
 deciding to go to therapy can sometimes be difficult for some but with the right therapist healing is possible and obtainable even with what youve described  to answer your question no you do not have too many issues to go to counseling 
human beings are complex creatures and in my opinion our issues interconnect in a very nuanced web between our levels of being for example mind body and spirit  everything you bring up affects all three 
  there is no correct number of topics yousometimes people go to therapy for one specific area of their life 
first step is to accept your nervousness and restless sleep  as often as possible sleep during daytimes in order for your body to catch up on its need for rest 
 finding out the cause of depressionanxiety isnt always as straightforward as it seems since both issues tend to become patterns we engage in rather than solely related to a specific triggerreason  for example if i am feeling down about a particular circumstance in my life then i start seeing life through this lens of feeling down and typically ill start to see a lot more that i get down about and it can really build very quickly on itself 
 hypnosis and meditation have helped a lot of people with anxiety and depression  google hypnotherapists near me or write for a while about what is going on 
 sometimes just the act of being able to talk about things with a nonjudgmental person helps take some of the burden off of you  a therapist can help you change your thought patterns and teach you coping skills to reduce your symptoms 
a basic protocol of natural health makes quick work of it about 23 monthsish maybe shorter with a good constitution in your body  
meditation…breaks anxious thought patternsa common symptom of anxiety is having racing negative and obsessive thoughts that create a vicious cycle of worry within your mind  meditation can reduce rumination and the break negative thought patterns by increasing your control over random unwanted thoughts and decreasing your tendency to worry by altering the way your brain responds to stress 
 i dont consider them as diseases  depression is a symptom of deep hurts to the sense of self that leaves a person feeling shamed 
 i am sorry that you are suffering so much  depression and anxiety can arise due to experiences genetics or a combination of both 
 depression and anxiety are very common reasons people come into counseling  both can be debilitating 
 overcoming anxiety and depression is not an easy feat to do on your own especially if its been something you have been battling for years  there are some different routes you may go down in order to start the healing processtherapy  find a therapist who has a lot of experience with anxiety and depression 
changing these deep major structures in your life takes time to try new ways and see what develops then fine tune accordingly most commonly anxiety and depression relate to ones self definition 
even if nothing currently goes on in a particular moment it’s possible you’re reflecting on a serious or upsetting matter and our emotions linger within us 
 it could be that there are things that are affecting how upset you are but because so many other things are going on you may not notice another idea to try is to keep a list for a month of one good thing that happened each day 
 please contact us in whatever way is most comfortable for you and we can get you set up with someone who will help you figure out this space in your life  
to know your limitations and the areas of your life which they affect will greatly contribute to stronger selfknowledge within you greater awareness and sense of direction very often decreases depression 
 also google some of the key words you just wrote here like depression and counseling lowcost counseling did your primary physician tell you their reason to not help you? if not then ask the person to tell you their reasoning 
e  pacific clinics hathaway sycamore pasadena mental health center burbank family center 
if you are medically clear in the reasons for losing your erection then reflect on what may be creating a loss in confidence in either who you are and what youre doing with your life or whether your wife has these sort of problems within herself often a problem transfers ownership of who shows it 
 in cases where there is no medical reason for the loss of erection i find that many men have a similar situation in experiencing negative intrusive thinking during lovemaking  my counseling approach for this situation is to incorporate the use of mindful sex 
 while this can certainly cause some embarrassment a diminished sexual esteem or relationship problems it is important to know you are not alone  i am going to move forward assuming that you have already checked with a medical professional to rule out any medical problems that may be related to this 
 a proper detoxification is necessary to reverse the stagnation and get things flowing again lower circulation and pituitary might also be indicated 
 ed can be caused by any number of physical conditions and you need to get checked out once you have ruled out any physical issues that interfere with getting an erection its time to look for more subtle causes 
 there is a phenomenon called the yerkes dodson law see below source wikipedia which basically states that if we feel either too much or too little stress pressure or nervousness about a task it will adversely impact our ability to do carry it out successfully the ideal amount of stressarousal is right in the middle  not too little and not too much 
and to begin we focus upon your physical and move right up the latter to the spiritual and begin cleaning you out unbalance is an experience of blocked energies that should be naturally flowing call them what thou mayest when blockages are removed what is naturally there flows and flows beautifully 
for example at the start of your period do you have that i feel great feeling or are you tired and down? midcycle assuming your periods are regular do you find yourself napping or ready to run a race? either way how you feel may be leading you to behaviors that contribute to your changes in energy and optimism lets say that the few days before your period you feel cranky bloated and want salty food 
as a woman we experience peaks and dips during our hormonal cycles and right before menstruation we tend to feel not ourselves and down  the bloating and extreme cravings do not help either 
as much as posible schedule activities around your expected mood swings   this way youll avoid feeling even more tired from a busy scheduled during a low energy time in the month 
 according to new research within the field of neuroscience there is a valid explanation for this  when a person cuts or uses other forms of self harm the body produces endorphins to help make a person feel better 
 when we get stuck using selfharm as a way to deal and manage emotions when something serious happens it totally makes sense that that will be one the first things to go through the mind  it is its own kind of addiction 
 typically only animals that are specifically trains to accomplish a specific task are legally protected as service animsls  even though that can be very helpful emotional support animals are not generally protected in the same way 
emotional support animals are untrained animals typically pets or other domestic animals that provide wonderful services to their owners and there are many benefits to having one service animals who are trained to provide specific services for an individual with limitations that make them fall under what the ada defines as disabled are protected under specific laws and must be accommodated in public places where the human they serve is present 
ask the manager if theyd accept an explanatory letter from a therapist who is licensed to diagnosis emotional disabilities if the answer is yes then find a therapist whos willing to cooperate with what you need from them and find out this particular therapists terms of working with you to compose such a letter 
 the ones that are officially trained actually go through months of training and then are paired with someone for whom they perform specific tasks you may benefit from looking at the blog written by valerie parrott who has an emotional support dog due to severe anxiety and panic 
 its really hard to deal with a spouse that isnt taking you seriously  in this case i would plan for and schedule a time to talk with him about this 
 it is hard for someone to understand what depression is without having experienced it themselves  unfortunately people without depression sometimes mistake it as feeling sorry for ourselves or just moping around which is not what depression is at all 
 by nature men tend to be more of the fix it type  so if they are sad they fix it 
from what you write your husband doesnt have any interest to know about you and your sad feelings stay clear in understanding that you already did your part by asking him to listen and care about the way you feel 
 this may sound counterintuitive but sometimes we do things that on the surface may look problematic or even cause us some real problems because it serves us in some unseen way  a simple example would be somebody who is addicted to a substance their addiction may be causing serious problems in their life and they may even know it but the addiction serves them by helping them to avoid painful feelings that they anticipate having if they quit using 
 this is one of the most common things that i personally have seen in the population of individuals who suffer from depression  it is often that i notice clients focusing on the negative to the complete dismissal of the positive when they are dealing with depression 
 make sure you are eating well exercising and getting outside when you can  take a trip to someplace warm if possible 
 it seems like since the winter blues happens to you every year it may also be impacting your quality of life and possibly relationships  what you report sounds like you may be experiencing seasonal affective disorder sad and is quite common to many from about fall thru winter seasons but also can impact folks during the spring and summer months 
 you are not alone  the name for the condition is seasonal affective disorder sad 
 winter depression seasonal affective is something that affects a lot of people both people who also deal with other kinds of depression that happens to get worse in the winter as well as people who just deal with depression in the winter  light affects how our bodies release and absorb neurotransmitters such as serotonin and most believe that a major contributing factor for winter depression is that we get less light when it is colder outside and darker outside 
 when winter hits we tend to find ourselves huddled inside from the cold  not to mention the sun is out for a much shorter time 
 the elements along with wind windchill and severely cold temperatures maylead to feelings of sadness anxiety and low energy  for some people thesesymptoms occur each year from late fall to early spring and may be sufferingfrom a condition known as seasonal affective disorder sad 
 many people suffer from the winter blues which is called seasonal affective disorder  some people notice that during the fall and winter months they tend to struggle with signs and symptoms of depression such as sadness or hopelessness lethargy sleeping to much or too little changes in appetite loss of interest in usual interests and possibly suicidal thoughts 
 the amount of daylight hours decreases significantly  most times it is dark when you go to work and dark when you return home 
 seasonal affective disorder or seasonal depression occurs during the same season every year  you might have feel feeling depressed the past two winters but cheered up during the warmer months 
  feeling sad may open many doors to reflect and make peace with the source of your sadness also i believe fighting against the natural cycle of rest and hibernation may not even be possible to succeed 
 also consider what is it that the change in weather changes in your life? if for example when its sunny you are an outdoorsy active person and when the weather changes youre whole activity level changes along with it you could explore how to get some of that activity replicated indoors in the winter months  
 sit outside for 10 minutes three times every day use a therapy light during the day aromatherapy oils for stimulation but  
 understanding that we have very little control over the weather therefore we can focus on the things we can change  exercising meditation guided imagery and deep breathing can be beneficial to combat seasonal depression 
 here are some possible tipsconsider if you know anything about what specifically is making you feel sad? if youre looking for activities because you cannot participate in what you like to do in the warmer months consider finding some indoor winter activitiesconnect with others  one idea is to join a group such as a book club that meets regularly 
are you surprised that your soon to be ex doesnt help with your teenage daughter?usually patterns and dynamics in parenting are not sudden developments is it possible that what youre feeling now is more intensity to the stress of parenting by yourself not that this is a sudden problem?this is relevant because you may be more familiar and more capable than youre giving yourself credit 
 search out a local support group through community counseling type centers  if you cant find a group at least get in to see a therapist who can help you manage stress and upset better 
 if this sounds like a familiar pattern for you this may have happened without you even realizing it if you were raised in a family where you had to pick up the slack alot  maybe your parents were addicts or they might have even just worked all the time and you learned to take care of everything because that is what you had to do to help the family run smoothly 
for instance you do know that youre unsure about your life direction take off any pressure on yourself to decide an answer in a certain amount of time 
 sometimes we are so focused on something we havent achieved yet or on comparing ourselves to others that we lose touch with what we actually want and need  at times like this its important to go back to basics 
having said that i wonder if you could consider how you would define yourself to someone who doesnt know you  for example honest adaptable funloving dependable compassionate openminded dedicated etc 
the real way youll find out what this feeling is about is to ask yourself your own question  inside you are the only one who will feel when you discover the true answer to your question 
emotions are real and reflect how someone feels about a situation since youre sad about losing a loved one be patient w your feelings about this 
your question says a lot about what you want rather than what she wants or what may be best for her  sometimes whats best for a person is the hardest thing to do and may be completely opposite of what you want 
 the best thing you can do is let her know that you are there for her as a support system  i would encourage her to talk more if it helps and encourage her to get move involved in doing activities she likes to do 
did the two of you share drinking as an activity? if yes then did you stop drinking too?often when partners meet each other as drinking buddies when one gets sober the relationship ends  once the terms of any relationship changes one possibility is that it dissolves 
 she may benefit from exploring why she wants to move and see if she would still want to move if she did not feel depressed  12 step meetings can also be helpful 
 have their been some significant events in her life that have affected her? have their been significant events in your relationship that can be affecting you both? if she just stopped drinking she may be struggling to finding an alternativeand healthier behavior  this is something the two of you can explore together 
since you are willing to speak about how you feel keep looking for blogs and forums on whatever topics you feel most describe your current circumstance your mother and sister even though they are family seem to prefer the opposite method to yours 
im not sure what you mean when you say youre not stable and you are breaking down  if you are crying because youre sad that is okay 
wife and mother are meaningful positions  and in your case in order to feel your own growth other areas of who you are would like your attention 
 and there are more societal pressures on mothers to be everything to their children and families  in that effort to be everything cook housekeeper planner social organizer teacher etc it can be easy to forget about being you 
 you have shifted roles in your life  you went from having a career to focusing on your family 
you say you feel like nothing more than a wife and mom so i wonder if you could make a list of what else you are friend daughter etc  
 i find that there are three steps to getting ready for treatment step one is expressing interest in wanting to receiving treatment for the outcome of positive behavioral change 
 however there is a caveat namely you will need the right counsellor with the right approach  this leads to two questions 1 what are the identifiers for the right counsellor and 2 what is the right approach?1 what are the identifiers for the right counsellor? the right counsellor will almost certainly have a lot of experience 
 a medical evaluation is warranted to rule out poor health issues  blood work is helpful 
trust your own instinct that the pills arent helping you pills work differently for everyone and not all people feel better from them 
usually people who have a university level eduction are old enough to work in order to support themselves unless you have a medical condition which limits or prevents you from working a fulltime job would you guess that the effort and thought involved in deciding in what professional area and geographic location to look for work would offer you a way to establish your identity?my suggestion is to pay more attention to your own likes dislikes and interests 
you mentioned that you have an education and some basic daily needs  i wonder if you may be able to look at your relationship with yourself and what makes you feel happy safe and having a sense of accomplishment 
 its hard to determine whether your friend would meet the criteria for an official diagnosis of depression without working with him however whether he does or not therapy may be beneficial for him in working through these difficult feelings and relational challenges  unfortunately you cant make your friend get help 
it keeps trying to get you to know whats going on deep within you anxiety is a sign of stress and weariness 
when you said that you are jaded im not sure whether you mean that you are jaded toward someone something life in general or some combination thereof one of the difficult things about anxiety is that anxiety can lead to more anxiety because of being concerned about having another panic attack 
 often we assume that feeling sadness is bad and that we should only feel happiness and joy but all feelings have a purpose joy sadness anger frustration excitement anxiety among others  is not healthy to experience the same feeling for a long time so we should learn to identify what causes them and how to process them so you can navigate through life experiences with more ease 
 the important part is to recognize that you need help addressing those feelings and reaching out which you are doing already  having small conversations with your family is helpful you can explain to them that you have been experiencing emotional discomfort and would like to talk to them about it 
to have no interest may mean you are already so saturated with recent situations and their meaning that you are naturally withdrawing in order to regain your energy  
knowing the name of some typical ways you may feel think and behave doesnt help you or anyone to understand why the person is the way they are and how to change any of these characteristics both selfdiagnosing and being diagnosed are equally unhelpful to know why you are the way you are and what to do about it 
 selfdiagnosing is something that we all do about one health issue or another  taking a guess about what may or may not be happening to us is completely normal however the actual clinical diagnoses of a mental health disorder requires a licensed mental health professional 
how did you meet the two friends who just moved away?  its possible that you could look for similar situations and see if anyone catches your interest to know as a friend keeping in mind that friendship is based on trust and common interests and that these qualities require time to observe and develop think of what you can do to keep happy while these paths unfold 
definitely all family members have an effect on the other ones from what you write your family members are not considering the effect their negative comments have on you 
look at your major areas of where you spend your time whether you are happy with the people with whom you socialize how you feel toward family members and how they seem to feel toward you if you examine your relationships and life this way then you may start to notice areas where you have some control or at least a say in how your life is going 
 i am very sorry that you are struggling  i have a few thoughts and perhaps some of my colleagues will add something else 
 there are lots of different options nowadays for therapists as you can see them online or in an office  my biggest tip for you is to use psychology today or counsel chat to find a therapist 
 its a great sign that you are seeking to reach out for help  and there are therapists everywhere there are even therapists online so you dont have to be that close to them or their office 
 after youve chosen somebody to try feel free to call them for a consultation! a lot of counselors and therapists offer free consultations and remember that your counselor is working for you so make sure they are a good fit! i hope this has been of some help  
 tons of good suggestions already but to add my two cents  you can find therapists in your area and read a little bit about them to find someone you like the sound of via this website and also via www psychologytoday 
 and if you have a specific topic which upsets you then google around with this topic to see if there are services specific to your interest if youve got time to invest in looking for the best fit therapist for yourself then google therapy or therapist

org who is in your area then give that therapist a call to see if you would be a good match  
 often times people think depression is more about feeling sad but depression can in fact express itself through irritability or bad mood as you say and lack of energy according to the dsmv diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders depression includes the following symptomsdepressed moodirritable mooddecreased interest or pleasure in activities you usually participate in or enjoysignificant weight change or change in appetitechange in sleep insomnia or hypersomniapsychomotor aggitation or retardationfatigue or loss in energyfeelings of worthlessness or excessive guiltdiminished ability to concentrate or indecisivenessthoughts of suicide or planthe great news is that there are many ways to improve depressive symptoms 
 because that could describe moreintroverted behavior people who feel more energy from a more internal approachas opposed to those who feel more energy from being among others  it is morein the second paragraph that i would be inclined to say that furtherexploration is definitely needed 
 it sounds to me like what your family is trying to tell you that they are worried about you and think this behavior might be a result of depression  if what you are experiencing seems fine and normal to you it may be nothing to worry about 
 its most important for me to impress that you dont have to live like this  
 do you feel what you have described impacts your day to day functioning? try to evaluate how is your self esteem motivation and self confidence  how about negative thoughts or hopelessness? any concerns about your grades sliding down? if you answered yes to any questions may be its time to see a counsellor 
 many people indicate that they feel numb or flat  people managing depression often have low motivation 
 being a teenager in our society today can cause depression quite easily  we look at the world in which we live and the doubts we have about being able to make a contribution or to have value and worth with the people around us and we begin to internalize those messages of selfworth 
otherwise people shortcut themselves to go deeper in understanding who they are and what theyd like to do with their lives and accept depression as though it is their new name what you write sounds like classic depression 
 from the very little that you have written it is clear that you are going through something that has made you extremely low affected your selfesteem and motivation limits your enjoyment of formerly pleasurable activities and affects your feelings of selfworth  all of these are aspects of being depressed though you can be depressed and still not have depression 
since the person in question is your friend offer your friendship to listen to any situations or feelings she has about herself and the way her life is going depressed people are often lonely people and feel as though no one around them cares or notices them 
teenage years are the first time any of us starts to feel and recognize our uniqueness  the fact that you recognize your great range of feelings as uncomfortable as they may sometimes be is healthy 
whether or not a clinician would decide to identify you as depressed matters much less than how you actually are feeling if you have some ideas as to what might improve your sense of being and how to go about reaching your goals if therapy during your childhood made you feel better and you feel you may be depressed then trying therapy at this point in your life makes sense 
youre doing the right move to state you dont want to discuss your depression with her i guess you could ask if she would like to know your reason to not speak w her about your depression 
 if you feel sad on most days it is worthwhile speaking to a psychologist to determine whether you suffer clinical depression  feeling sadness is a normal response to loss whether you lose a family friend job or something you deem important in your life 
your feelings sound like they are very strong and meaningful in your life keep in mind that your feelings about others has more to do with ones own selfview than with what the other person is actually doing 
 im interested to hear some more information such as if you live by yourself or family if you go to schoolemployedunemployed and what kind of things do you like to do with friends or by yourself  often times when we are experiencing a strong emotion that we interpret as negative we put most of our focus on that negative emotion and struggle to see that we do not alwaysfeel that specific emotion 
 empathy is the ability to look at the world through someone elses eyes or walk a mile in their shoes  there could be some people in your life for whom empathy is easier to feel and those for whom you have no idea what they are experiencing 
it is a skill that we learn with practice and refine as we become mature if you are feeling anxious maybe you are able to understand better others whoare going trough anxiety 
usually when people feel depressed they also feel lonely and isolated  since at this time you wouldnt want to tell anyone about the way you feel which includes the possibility that a few of the ones whom you tell would offer you emotional support give this to yourself 
 but finding that supportive person that you can share with is a big part of the battle with depression  depression thrives on being secret it seems to grow the more we isolate ourselves and hide it away so im with laura cassidy when she suggests finding that professional support person so you can start fighting back against your depression 
 i would first like commend you for realizing that you need to help with your depression by reaching out here  that is a great start and youve taken the very first courageous step 
 thoughts are not necessarily the truth of what will actually happen though illness makes negative situations look worse so be sure you are concentrating on specific areas of your life and not just assuming they will work out badly because you are ill 
 try to remember that whatever illness you are dealing with you are not the only person to have dealt with it and you are not alone! out there just waiting for you is a group of people that will totally understand what youre going through and will be able to share how they coped  try searching for a support group for your illness  google and www 
 so someone made you happy but is no longer around? i am sure that feels devastating  as a counselor i usually have to ponder this kind of thought because it lends itself to suggesting that happiness comes from the external rather than the internal side of a persons life 
 intimacy is a very natural human desire and at the same time learning to enjoy ourselves even when we are alone can strengthen our ability to lead a satisfying life in and out of relationship  working with a therapist you may be able to gain insight into how you show up in your relationships with yourself and others and discover more fulfilling ways to do so 
 more background information would have to be needed  one thing i would say is that you really need to seek guidance from a professional to work through these symptoms 
 it sounds like you are noticing that there is a significant difference between how you are feeling on the inside and how you express yourself outwardly  part of you is quite distressed and yet it remains invisible to the outside world almost as if it is trapped inside of your body 
 sometimes there are no labels for how we feel  sometimes there is no name for the emotions that we are experiencing 
 it may help you to know that many of us feel that we have missed out on our childhoods as well and that despite such deprivations for many of us our adult lives have been extraordinarily fulfilling due to our opening up to trusted adults  i recommend that you find a trustworthy adult to talk to 
as long as youve reached your conclusion that your parents do not take you seriously when you would like to speak with them on a serious topic and that you feel unable to trust either of them then work with your own information many people dont know how to listen and arent trustworthy 
 so job one is finding someone you can talk to  a good friend or an open parent can be as helpful as a professional counselor but if you dont have those then by all means call your local mental health association suicide prevention or go see your school counseling department 
 while your parents surely love you and want to understand you it may be difficult for them to fully understand your feelings and experiences  they are quite a bit older and have likely not dealt with some of the struggles that you face 
 it can be difficult to share such intimate information  to begin it sounds likes your primary concern your desire to speak to someone who takes your mental health seriously 
 having older parents can certainly pose challenges  most kids feel like their parents dont understand them but yours are older than the average parents of teenagers 
 being 15 years old can be a very difficult time in your teenage life  i remember when i was 15 and how i often felt my parents weren’t listening to me 
 the use of affirmation and gratitudes helps to remind ourselves of all of the aspects of our lives  
youre certainly not alone in feeling this way!try to follow the logic of your feelings by asking yourself questions about the empty feeling   doing this may open up a discovery about the reason for the emptiness feeling 
 it also sounds like current conflicts are continuing to leave you feeling hurt and devalued  in working with a therapist you may be able to get some clarity about your past who you are and what kinds of boundaries you want in your relationships so that you can lead a life that is more satisfying to you 
 adults who come from abusive home histories physical emotional or even psychological may take a long time to heal from that abuse  we carry our past with us everywhere we go and it is up to us to find resolutions to past hurts 
 theres a difference between feelings like sadness discouragement grief loneliness and depression though  sadness is sadness and sometimes we have to go through a grieving or other process that is a normal reaction to events in our lives 
  this is the most natural way to feel at this time depending on how old you are and whether you live under their roof are dependent on their support and are either part of the decision or not of with whom and where you will live start considering these points 
 unfortunately it sounds like you were offered some that were more dangerous than helpful but be proud that you were able to curb those before they caused too much harm from what you have written stress has always been a difficult thing for you to manage 
 often we fall back on coping techniques that would be helpful in other problems stress social anxieties etc  for our depression but the truth is that depression requires its own little tool kit

 watching someone you love suffer so profoundly can bring up lots of difficult feelings  without knowing what you are already doing i have a few thoughts to share with you 
 i imagine that you must be going through your own difficult time too  youve had a complicated shock and trauma in your life and in your marriage its normal for both of your emotions to move from hope to despair to fear anger gratitude 
 it’s wonderful that you want to support your husband but if your husband is feeling depressed and hopeless you can best help him by getting him to a mental health professional  feelings of hopelessness and depression and previous attempts at suicide are all risk factors for future suicide attempts 
the first thing i would suggest is that you consider seeing a local mental health professional yourself to be able to talk about the details how this is affecting you and how you can hold onto you are while also being supportive to you husband from the way that you describe this i wonder what has changed since coming home from the hospital 
give yourself some time to concentrate on how youve been affected by your husbands suicide attempt   even if you decide against immediately telling him how youre feeling knowing this about yourself will guide how and the topics you bring up with him 
 but it is also important of being aware of your emotions  how are you feeling after the suicide attempt? it is common to experience negative feelings while you try to make sense of the incident 
 a full assessmentevaluation with a mental health professional is warranted to understand if indeed you meet criteria for a major depressive disorder i e 
 i would wonder about your experience with anger and if youve ever been discouraged from expressing anger  i would also wonder if you feel like you have space to express yourself in your relationship or if you feel like you really arent being heard 
you could try having a conversation when youre not fighting and starting it out by saying that you would like to discuss something important to you and see if your fiancée is open to that something else is that you could have an agreement that if one of you is having a really strong emotions in a difficult conversation and would like to break from the conversation you could agree ahead of time that youll say that you would like a timeout and will come back to discuss the issue in a certain amount of time usually about an hour and then try to resume the discussion 
 people tell us things and we tend to think thats the truth  
 there are several counselors that see people on a sliding scale that can be as low as 5 based on your income  find a center that is nonprofit they have great counselors as well 
  then you will be choosing a therapist who feels compatible with your way of seeing yourself and your life also therapy isnt for everyone 
i will say that there are several different types of medications that may help and each therapist is different so it is quite possible that a different combination of things youve already tried may be helpful i would encourage you to continue trying different therapists 
 you have no idea what is going to happen in the next second so focusing on thinking you will never have a good career or amount to anything financially is creating a fictitious story  remind yourself of that every time the thought pops up 
 there is nothing worse than fearing abandonment when you are already struggling with depression  it sounds like you are still wanting to work through whatever challenges you and your husband are having but your husband may not be on the same page

how about your friends are any of them nurturing or treat you kindly when you bring up that youve got this problem?are any of your friends willing to accommodate the fact that right now youve got panic attacks from driving and being a passenger?maybe being and feeling accepted while youre in this current phase of your life would help diminish the panic attacks if no support is coming to you then a next step would be to evaluate the relationships in your life and to develop standards and expectations of others especially that they are considerate of your great need at this time

initiate this type of discussion at a time which is removed from the time you’re about to have sex this way you and your partner both have a chance to realize the two of you are having a discussion not a prelude to sex

 the thing about changing things up when they get tough is that they often arent the things that need changing  the awesome and challenging thing about it is that when you work on the internal aspects that may need attention you can learn to find a sense of centeredness that comes with practicing mindfulness and asking yourself who you really are and want to be 
if you feel tension or that somehow doing as you describe is wrong then the first step is to identify the way you feel your methodology described above has a role in working against your best interest basically define what is problematic in order to address it 
 coping with the difficulties does make you more resilientand helps you to build the confidence you need to solve problems in the future now i wonder are things getting tough in a way that you are not able to resolve them? do you need to move or change to save yourself or prevent any harm? if so it is ok to know when to remove ourselves form situations that harm us more than helping us 
 it may be helpful to talk to someone who you trust to get a sense of whether the changes that you are making are those that are considered adaptable or important changes that allow us all to grow  another possibility is that you are changing things in an effort to get away from something that is uncomfortable or difficult

 anxiety is our brains way of prompting us to deal with the stress in our lives by getting us geared up for action some helpful ways of managing anxiety are actually very simple 
try to think of why youd feel insecure or have very little confidence in your ability to complete or be in relationships is it possible you were very heavily criticized when you were young and growing up?very often kids who are not encouraged to try new activities have fun in relating to others learn to not trust themselves to handle these fundamental parts of life 
 often cognitive distortions are the problem  some common cognitive distortions include catastrophizing predicting the worst future telling black and white thinking if its not perfect its terrible mindreading i just know he is angry at me and cantstanditis i cant stand this situation 
 recognizing these nagging thoughts of self doubt as imposter syndrome is a huge step in the right direction  from what you have written here it appears that you are able to challenge your own thoughts and provide yourself with evidence that counteracts the imposter syndrome 
imposter syndrome sounds like a name someone made up to write a book and have lots of people buy it bc it gives the feeling they know themselves by calling themselves this name instead consider your own unique qualities including your fears of being recognized as adding value to peoples lives 
 are there specific situations where youve noticed the feelings of im going to be found out as a fraud becoming more strong? it seems that shaking this feeling is very important to you  in my opinion before shaking that feeling we need to get closer to it and understand its roots 
basically there is a fundamental lack of honesty in some important parts of your life my guess would be relationships that has led to this sense of dread and guilt i wonder where the dishonesty be 
 youve probably read articles already about impostor syndrome but still didnt get the answers you were looking for you probably know that lots of people feel this way that it happens to lots of successful people in professional settings  not helping right?think about people who succeed at big tasks an olympic athlete has a defined goal that they need to meet cross the finish line say faster than anyone else 
 first i am so sorry you are experiencing these feelings  they can be intense i will do my best to offer some suggestions or thoughts that i hope will be helpful to you 
 since youre already going to counseling congratulations on taking that big first stressinducing step  hopefully by now you are starting to feel a little more comfortable with your therapist 
 therapy is hard work! you may be talking about some things that you never talked to anyone about before  opening up to stranger can be scary 
 its absolutely ok to feel nervous going to therapy  i have experienced anxiety going to see my own therapist 
 its completely normal and natural to feel nervous before a therapy session  many people report having felt this way 
 youre likely feeling an internal truth about the sessions the man or woman with you and the man or woman sitting across from you  id listen to those feelings 
 opening up to someone you dont know from a can of paint can elicit some uncomfortable feelings and make you feel shaky  with time and building trust with your therapist you will eventually start feeling less apprehensive before sessions 
 you are being vulnerable and honest which is always scary no matter how many times you do it  the best part about therapy is that the more you go the more confident you are in your ability to work through those difficult feelings and while you still may sometimes get nervous you will have confidence too! 
 i think that with clients who i work with that have difficult times in relationships maybe being able to trust people is tougher for them given their life experiences the expectation would be that they have a harder time moving through those nerves and feeling more at peace in sessions in my opinion a competent therapist could help you explore where these nerves are actually coming from talking about yourself relating to another something else? i encourage all of my clients to bring up whatever emotions are coming up for them in the moment as its helpful to the client to recognize the present moment emotion and then being able to process learn from and move through to a more peaceful place if that is what is being sought 
 that said its definitely worth bringing to the attention of your therapist if you havent already to see if there is anything that they can do or that the two of you can explore together that might make the process feel less intimidating to you  
 i have gone myself as a counselor and know what that feeling is like  this is normal but hopefully you have become more comfortable with your therapist 
 another important thing to note is that although you go to therapy that is just a room most of the magic and work takes place in your real life outside of that room  
therapy is an unusual way to have a conversation with someone   the person is an expert in recognizing and understanding dynamics of human interactions 
 many people take years to make the decision to start counseling and although it is a safe place to explore feelings it may be the first time you are facing certain issues  it takes courage to face issues head on 
 therapy often explores topics and feelings that are uncomfortable  the ultimate goal of therapy is to feel better but the process itself can be uncomfortable 
  its sometimes hard to share our emotions and feelings with someone  no matter how warm and caring the therapist is    are you comfortable with your therapist? is it a good relational fit?   maybe this is a good thing to discuss with your specific therapist at the beginning of your next session  maybe they can help you find some strategies or tools to make it easier? 
 its also common to feel anxious when you are discussing something that is important difficult to discuss or you are making changes that are very difficult for you the most important thing i can tell you though is to discuss with your therapist this idea that you feel nervous and shaky 
yes you could still be shaky and nervous going to therapy  this therapy thing your doing is sometimes scary 
 many of my clients are nervous the first couple of times we meet  this isessentially a strangerwith whomyou are sharingyourfeelings 
 my suggestion is to discuss this with your therapist let himher know how youre feeling especially if you feel as though your level of anxiety is impacting the quality and benefit of your sessions  you might try some relaxation techniques prior to starting the session deep breathing progressive relaxation core muscle disengagementif youre not familiar with these techniques ask your therapist or write back 
 you ask about being nervous and shaky walking in to your therapy session and want to know if its normal?   
 it implies theres one particular way you should be behaving and can leave you feeling crappy and abnormal if youre not behaving according to that prescribed standard  instead what id recommend is to pay attention to your emotional experiences when youre attending therapy 
 being nervous can be a typical emotion one might feel  emotions are our bodys way of telling us important information about ourselves 
 therapy can be a rewarding process however often times we do not pay much attention to the messages being sent to our bodies  i believe in somatic therapy which deals with our mind  body connection 
 in any case bringing up your feelings about therapy intherapy is totally appropriate and even necessary  good luck! 
 id start with discussing with mom your concerns and ideal situation  im unsure what prevents you from staying there but whoever you are staying with it should be brought to their attention 
 i would gently and lovingly tell your father that youve decided to stay with your mother  you can offer to visit him regularly if youd like 
 we have to think of your safety and take care of those thoughts of hurting yourself yes this is a major problem for you and can cause anxiety and depression 
if these conversations are not getting your problem solved then maybe your therapist can have a family session with your parents together and depending on the outcome with you and each parent  
 divorce can be so disruptive in a childs life id really need a lot more information about your situation before id feel comfortable offering any advice or suggestions 
 when we are on high alert we tend to look for threats and often the greatest threats we experience on a daily basis are social in nature  to some extent this is normal for example when people experience late onset deafness they often will worry people are talking about them and usually not good things because our brains tend to jump to that 
 its understandable that it could be confusing andor a bit scary to be unsure if people are speaking to you or not  its hard to say exactly what is going on from just this description but if you can work with a competent therapist you may be able to get more insight into what is happening get clarity about your social interactions and develop some ways to deal with the anxiety 
 its normal for us to wake a few times in the night however when we are dealing with high anxiety or stress those times can turn into being up most night  given that you are having these repeated dreams i am wondering what might be going on in your life either now or in the past that could be triggering stress or maybe memories 
the bad news is the feelings themselves are sickening probably a therapist would be very helpful for guiding you to unfold these uneasy feelings and their source 
 and youre right that being separated from our partners can heighten our insecurities and worries about not only our relationship security but about our partners interest  have you talked with your boyfriend about this struggle youre feeling? it can be hard to have this kind of conversation without triggering a sense of blame and subsequent defensiveness in our partners but it really is possible 
 its normal in a relationship for us to slow down a bit with the attachment behaviours that establish and deepen love and connection  so just because your boyfriend isnt talking as much or keeping you uptodate doesnt necessarily mean what you fear it means 
this way he has a chance to answer your questions as to why he doesnt keep in touch his responses will guide your next steps 
 this way you have an idea when youll be able to contact him  does he recognize the feelings that you have while he is away? how do you feel when you are together with him and he is home?im also curious as to how the level of your anxiety on a scale of 1 to 10 perhaps changes during the parts of his trips 
recognizing your action and trying to directly correct it realizing your action was improper and demonstrating the willingness to take right action are all examples of making things right since the actual driver is unavailable to consult as to their wishes on what they expect and feel would correct the matter you did the next best thing and considered the situation from the driver point of view 
 in your example here id encourage you to always think safety first and never offer a stranger at the accident scene   
try to understand more about who you are what you like feel uneasy about especially your deeper emotions of being emotionally harmed or injured by meaningful people anxiety is best addressed indirectly by understanding and kindly accepting previous hurt and fears from long ago 
try to figure out what would make you feel more relaxed about talking to your dad or stepmom also its possible you simply dont feel safe around either of them and so intuitively realize youre better off not talking with them about a delicate matter 
 the concern that i can hear in what you have written is that the thought of having some anxiety has now left you uncomfortable with any anxiety at all  and that can become a problem indeed as opposed to thinking about your anxiety as something much bigger than you it could be helpful to start breaking it down 
 apparently your employers think highly of you since they hired you!you say that people keep telling you that you have anxiety  how do they know? have you told others you are sometimes upset or nervous? have you been treated for anxiety? or is that a perception that others have that you havent been able to counter?its a new job and it requires you to do new things in new places with new people  being nervous is not just normal it may actually help you be on your toes and do a good job 
 doing some mindfulness activities such as deep breathing exercises grounding or mindfulness meditation can help center and calm yourself in moments of anxiety when being away from your family it may also be helpful to make a list of your concerns or fears about being away from your family 
 anxiety can be so challenging especially when new challenges have come up  it would be good to work through some of these issues you are experiencing and examine your self care and support processes 
 chances are you accepted this opportunity knowing that sometimes you feel heightened levels of anxiety while traveling or at least people are telling you this is true rather than working towards how to stop it from happening it might make more sense to prepare for if it does often when we know how we might deal with a situation the situation doesnt manifest on a more broad scope though tools to minimize anxious feelings abound there are apps headspace or happify for example therapy helps and tools like yoga and meditation can help reduce anxious feelings too 
 here are a few tools you can use that will help in the short term keeping your mind occupied by listening to books on tape may help counting backwards from 100 in 7s naming cities that begin with each letter of the alphabet keeping some ice or an ice pack in a cooler beside you which you may take out and hold in your hand or to your face soothing selftalk such as this is uncomfortable but i can handle it or ive been through this before and can make it through again  i recommend that you seek out a therapist to help you with some longterm solutions to the anxiety 
 starting a new job can be scary and having to travel away from your home and family can make it even more anxiety provoking do allow yourself to be anxious about this new journey we can be hard on ourselves think if it was a friend that was turning to you for help what solutions would you have offered them but also continue to seek to secure right support as well 
 this would be difficult for many people and it seems that you have an added layer of challenge  i recommendvisiting a therapist to determine the root cause of your anxiety and working to unravel those causes piece by piece 
  please dont be anxious about being anxious if you feel anxiety coming over you then pull off the road to a safe place 
 notice if your anxiety feels like excitement concerns or fear it seems like you are excited about your new job but worried because others are telling you that you have anxiety 
first make sure that your seating arrangement in your car is comfortable  if you are driving long distances on a regular basis you want to make sure that your body is in a comfortable position 
 what you are experiencing is entirely reasonable for someone that is still trying to adjust to a new life and also leave behind a long term relationship  it sounds like you lost touch with who you were as a person and need to start exploring that side of you again 
 sometimes we can lose a sense of who we are because in a way we have become defined by the relationship itself  so when we begin to move on and see other people our sense of identity may be obscured 
theres a few ideas ill throw out there and you can choose if they stick  one is to reinvest in the friendships you have by setting up regular coffee gettogethers for example 
relationship breakups mean a persons entire life goes through an adjustment since the relationship impacted all areas of your life give yourself some patience to restore yourself from the old relationship 
sometimes people who anxious in specific realtime situations are helped by talking themselves through the anxiety maybe youd be able to distract yourself from the grocery store anxiety by telling yourself youre anxious and that youll be ok its only a grocery store 
 im not sure whether you have anxiety of public places large crowds being alone sometimes called separation anxiety or some combination thereof one thing that would be helpful would be to track your anxiety and see how anxious you are on a scale of 1 to 10 in different situations 
 you are in a unique place  so few have reached that level 
 looking at your question when it is said that the presentations make me feel stress you are giving the responsibility of the stress to the presentations and taking that away from your self  the presentations cannot give or take away your stress thats something only you can do and you can do it!  what language can you change in your self talk? for example are you saying i cant speak in front of an audience! ill fail? that sounds a lot different than i studied my butt off and if i practice speaking out loud i can ace this presentation! although this is a short answer i do believe that counseling will help you overcome these stressful feelings and bring out your inner confidence 
 in the meantime do whatever you can to help yourself feel prepared for each presentation  do your work ahead of time so that you feel wellinformed on your topic and then spend the days leading up to your presentation practicing 
giving presentations is not necessarily a difficulty with communication   it has more to do with performance than expressing yourself clearly 
 cry away therapist are very used to it first time being in therapy is scary but youll soon know if you are a good match  
 when you start counseling you dont yet know your counselor very well so its normal to keep your feelings in check until you feel comfortable and a bit more relaxed with your counselor and with the situation  sometimes though there are emotions that have been waiting and waiting to finally find someone who will listen with a kind ear 
 i suggest that you consider how you would feelrespond to someone that was confiding to you and they began to cry  if you felt concerned supportive and empathetic then you know exactly how us therapists feel when our clients are emotional in sessions 
 your therapist understands that calling and getting an appointment was a big step for you and will do their best to put you at ease  providing a safe environment for our clients includes not judging them and being comfortable with the information and emotions that they share with us 
 we might encourage you to put words to the tears as well to help you expand on your experience and begin to make more sense of it as a therapist our job is help you open up and feel comfortable enough doing so 
 i can understand wanting to keep everything together and put your best foot forward with everyone you come into contact with but it can be such a powerful experience to cry with somebody that can hear you and accept you  its so brave of you to go and share yourself with your counselor! i hope you will keep being brave as you begin healing 
 crying is a natural way for us to cope with the sadness that we experience in life  when confronting some of these things in a counseling session tears just seem to come naturally 
 starting therapy takes a lot of courage when you work with a therapist once you feel safe  you talk about a lot of very private and potentially emotional things that you may have never discussed with anyone before  i have seen people cry with sadness  cry with relief at releasing painful things they have held onto for a long time cry because they feel so relieved that they finally feel heard 
 crying is a natural response and it also releases toxins so some might say its necessary! remember that you can be in charge of what you talk about in your session and if theres something that feels too uncomfortable just say im not ready to talk about that  your counselor wants you to feel at ease and will probably not push you right away to a very uncomfortable place 
 actually most people cry in their therapists office  i tell my clients that its safe to cry in my office and crying isnt a sign of weakness 
crying when realizing the emotional hurt and unfairness between you and someone clears you for new ways of handling interactions as a therapist i always have a box of tissues on the table next to the couch where people who utilize my therapy sit 
 people cry laugh rage rant and talk during counseling sessions  part of the therapy process is to look at your feelings and to feel what you are actually feeling instead of what you think you should feel 
 you don’t feel safe in relationships and prefer to isolate yourself from the outside world  is it something you can talk to your parents about?a school counselor could help you 
 before deciding whether it was social anxiety or a more general type of anxiety i would wonder what it is that you think will result from you raising your hand or talking to someone you dont know  here is some information on social anxietyhttpssocialanxietyinstitute 
start by meeting yourself reflect as thoroughly as possible as to what you imagine will be the outcome of meeting others or of speaking up during a class 
 as you said these are intrusive and unwanted thoughts  not genuine desires to harm them  this is a form of ocd we often call harm or pedophilic ocd 
  this together with the fact of searching for selfunderstanding sound more like someone who is unsure and puzzled not someone who is bad what was your own childhood like?the sensations you describe feeling sometimes occur in people who are reminded of very deep hurts from during their own childhood 
otherwise the answer to your question would appear naturally  if you genuinely feel close enough to this person to sleep with him then who texts whom first wouldnt really matter too much 
 it would be up to him to reply when he can and wants to but i dont know why you couldnt initiate contact one thing to consider as you get to know each other better is having conversations about conversations 
 oh that is so frustrating! have you ever heard of social anxiety? sounds like you may be suffering from it  here is a link to a quiz 
if youve had any type of violation during your growing up years or witnessed someone in your family be violated emotionally physically or through some terrible accident or incident then you may hesitate to believe other people are safe and not to be feared give yourself plenty of time and reassurance that as long as you are making sincere effort to increase you comfort around other people eventually you will succeed 
 one layer is the daunting news that your son has autism  many parents can feel overwhelmed and distraught with this diagnosis 
 if your discomfort is somehow related to your sons diagnosis or your lack of employment or an abusive relationship you were in and maybe embarrassed about that is important to understand and get clarity around when we can understand on a deep level what is happening for us i 
 it might also be worth thinking about where your bar is set do you want to be as comfortable around people as you were before your recent circumstances? or find your new normal and connect only with people who raise you up and bolster your selfesteem? you have the right to be both cautious if youre still surrounded by the same folks and environment and discerning  only connecting with people who will be supportive  all the best 
 it makes sense that you would feel nervous around people  working through the trauma of an abusive relationship in itself can be a difficult process 
 they will understand some of the things that you are experiencing at home and you may also find someone who feels that same way as you  if you have not sought professional counseling for the abusive relationship i would seek out a therapist who can help you process through it so you do not repeat similar choices in your next relationship 
have you told some of the people in your life about the many changes youve been through?  it is possible people sense something different about you and arent sure whether to ask or not ask questions also understand what type of qualities youd like to offer and receive in a friendship 
 there isnt really enough information provided here to suggest a particular disorder but it might be worth meeting with a counselor or therapist to do a formal assessment  some of the questions they might ask could be what other kinds of physical symptoms you experience how frequently these physical symptoms happen whats going on for you when they tend to happen and how frequentlyintensely you find yourself worrying in general 
 2 mentally anxiety presents itself as worry  worry that spirals out of control worry that dirsupts your life and concentration 
 e  heart racing sweaty palms sweating shortness of breath 
 items to write would be what were you doing before you felt this way did you eat and what what time of day is it how much sleep did you get that night etc  
 different types of anxiety are caused by different scenarios memories or stressors  once you identify what triggers the anxiety you may be able to identify thecopingmechanism that will help you handle your symptoms 
 i think it would be helpful if you work with a therapist who specializes in anxiety disorders  
yes youre describing classic symptoms of anxiety anxiety itself is the indirect result of repeatedly being in positions of feeling helpless or frightened 
 that certainly seems to fit what youre describing here but that doesnt mean you have an anxiety disorder necessarily  thats where there is a difference 
 first i want you to know that you are certainly not alone on this issue everyone atsome point in time has a fear of public embarrassment 
people have the capacity to judge others regardless of whether the group is large or small if you arent afraid of being judged in small groups then study the factors which allow you to feel safe in small groups 
  some people need the daily or frequent interaction to feel secure the question is not so much how to deal with anxiety that your partner is cheating on you than whether your own emotional and relationship requirements are satisfied with a long distance relationship 
although you didnt write this usually what keeps people awake or prevents them from falling asleep are worries about certain situations in their lives if this describes you then 
is it actually permitted that people are able to take support animals to school?i see your point of the animal helping you  i just also see the point that some people have allergies to animal hair or dander or may feel distracted by an animal in the classroom 
it is much easier to manage a problem when youre not fighting yourself for having a problem once you are willing to accept this quality within yourself you may start to feel a little more relaxed about handling the fears when they arise 
  eventually shell find out and better to talk about it when there is less pressure than to be in the midst of a situation which frightens you also she may feel similar to you who knows?discussing a topic which relates directly to your relationship is a good way to increase emotional intimacy 
 the longer answer could come from deeper exploration as to your fears or anxieties that you experience maybe just thinking of going outside  but any sort of exploration about this almost has to begin with an agreement within you and all of your feelings thats its not something to be ashamed of 
 if youre in the midst of severe stress whether within your relationship or effort to establish a relationship upheaval in family dynamics some type of significant loss like a job or someone with whom you feel closely attached then you may simply be creating the solitude which is necessary to better understand and absorb the meaning of these changes i assume you mean you are by yourself when you are indoors 
sometimes people who feel greatly hurt by others or who feel unloved by others imagine if they do the opposite of love which is to kill that they will get the recognition and acknowledgement from others which they wish would come to them in a loving way this is my theory it is not necessarily a definitive description of your inner dynamic 
 clearly this is something that has you very concerned  sometimes thoughts are just thoughts and they are pretty harmless 
the insecurity can sometimes feel overwhelming and this starts the sense of panic one way to build your sense of security within yourself is to have a simple life and a slow paced life 
if you shake all the time consider talking with your primary care physician  sometimes that can be a hormonal imbalance or another chemical imbalance such as thyroid 
 perhaps you are feeling burnt out! that is a big deal and please try not to take it lightly! when we get burnt out i have found that its from one of two things either we are not doing what we want or we are doing too much either of something we want or something we dont doesnt really matter once we get into doing too much if either of those rings true for your experience try as much as possible to sit with the experience and get a better sense of where the burn out is coming from 
what can help you feel better is to be kind and gentle with yourself because this sort of approach will more likely relax your mood and mindset enough for the tension and anxiety you feel to dissipate somewhat try to understand whether certain situations or interactions remind you or feel similar to ones which distressed you before 
 we would build a hierarchy of fears that is a list of fears ranging from least to most for example the man may want to start by looking at a picture of a bridge while employing his relation technique then he may want to see a real bridge from a distance while employing that same relaxation technique then moving closer to the bridge then maybe standing on a bridge all the while moving closer to his fear while relaxing until you come to most fearful proposition which is crossing that bridge or you can also engage in flooding which is for example if you were scared of an elevator go into an elevator until you are not panicking anymore in the movie batman begins bruce wayne who has a great fear of bats goes into this cave and allows himself to be surrounded by bats until he is no longer fearful of them  secondly look at your fears do they even need to be worked on some fears are healthy for example if i was a therapist in new york city and someone came to me and said im scared of snakes i would probably say that is ok because there are very little snakes left in manhattanhope that helps c 
  fears are sometimes irrational so that logic doesnt get rid of them think about whether you felt secure and confident as a child 
 in fact our five main emotions are joy fear sadness shame and anger  we tend to spend a lot of time and energy running away from or trying to get rid of most of those emotions and the more we do that the more we set ourselves up for failure and disappointment 
i wonder the followingon a scale of 1 to 10 how upset anxious or scared to you get when you think about overcoming this? if its more than a 510 i would definitely recommend talking with a therapist in your area a lot of fears that we have come from something that at one time was selfprotective and important 
 fear is not always a bad thing and in fact can be quite healthy and appropriate depending on the situation a phobia however is different 
 overcoming fears is something that everyone struggles with at one time or another  sometimes we come across something that scares us we push through it and suddenly we arent afraid anymore 
i try to understand how severe a problem these voices are if youve managed to get to a point in life of awareness about the voices usually when mental health people hear about voices the immediate thought is you need drugs bc you are psychotic 
 it is not normal to hear voices that arent your own but the fact is some people do  in my experience medication seem to help 
 hearing voices can be incredibly difficult and can feel like you cant get a moments peace even in the privacy of your own mind  and not everyone will necessarily understand what youre dealing with so i imagine you may also be feeling isolated or somehow different 
if you havent already you need to see a medical doctor asap to rule out medical causes for this  many diseases illnesses and conditions can cause hallucinations 
be patient with yourself too bc lasting change takes time alternatives to hitting your head require constant gentle reminders to do these new behaviors or if youve discovered a satisfying alternative in one moment time is required for you to repeat this alternative until it feels natural 
 i have to wonder from a behavioral perspective if what you are doing is useful for you  in other words does it serve a purpose in some way when you find yourself doing it 
 therapy should be a healthy positive experience off g growth you have the right to look for certain high qualities in a therapist and finding the right one 
 no one wants to be raped and i imagine everyone is afraid of what being raped would feel like do you mean that this fear is on your mind more often than you would like?if this is the case then try understanding the reason behind your fear 
 it sounds like youve had a traumatic experience that has impacted your life in many ways  without knowing much about your history i wonder if the trauma you suffered has lead to the anxiety anger and memory problems you are dealing with in addition to ptsd 
 while it seems anxiety is a likely problem here your doctor will hopefully know your history and can help you decide if you need some medical tests or some therapy  without knowing more thats all i can say at this point 
 dissociation is our minds way of disconnecting us from aspects of our experience in an attempt to protect us in overwhelming situations  it also sounds like you are noticing anxiety in certain situations 
 people who dissociate might feel like the world around them is unreal and unfamiliar or that they are not really in their bodies and that they are observing themselves from outside of their bodies  dissociation can also mean that there are parts of you that have split off and sometimes parts are can feel like they are at odds with each other or are locked in conflict 
 you may be right your physical symptoms of getting sick to your stomachmay very well be your nerves or anxiety  that is totally normal and understandable given your circumstances

dont let her opinions and beliefs get in the way of what you know about yourself are you in school and does that school have a guidance counselor?would you talk with that person about your difficult getting your mom to retain helping services for you?keep looking for local resources which will support you either directly or indirectly by advocating for your right to receive mental health care 
drugs dont do anything helpful in solving lifes problems   once the effect wears off the stressful situation is once again waiting for you to address it 
 medications are so helpful and needed at times but its also important to have a varietyof tools you use to manage your responses to stress  if you are not already seeing a therapist consider finding one who can help you learn some effective strategies like replacing selfdefeating thoughts with ones that work better for you or mindfulness relaxation or other tools to keep your anxiety in the manageable range! 
you mentioned that you are afraid that your medical provider will take you off of the xanax and put you on something else  if the xanax is not working well for you i wonder if something else may work better 
 while counselors work closely with medical providers and sometimes have discussions about medications with people we rarely make recommendations about how much or what typeof medicationa person should be taking  this is because prescribing and advising on medication is out of our scope of practice 
 they may be able to help you to know about all of the options that are available it sounds like your partner is open to understanding your concerns 
 is this medical advice or is this someone’sopinion trying to scare you from having sex?and if so how old are you? is it ok to have sex do you want to havesex? it sounds like you want to makeyour partner happy and that you are taking care of protecting yourself andyour partner but maybe you are forgetting to consider what do you really want  having sexual relations is a very personal decisionyou and your partner have to consent 
if this message came from your upbringing then it may a deeply embedded belief since the belief itself instructs to avoid risk and overturning this belief requires taking the risk to believe the logic that reasonable safe sex measures are adequate protection give yourself time to absorb this new understanding

 it can be hard to talk to your dad about this but he may think you love track and may not know you are getting so upset the days of meets  an idea would be to first write a letter to your dad to see what feelings come out and then preparing to speak with him 
 it sounds like you like to spend the time in your head anticipating the worst why not be in the present and encourage yourself that you can talk to people and it will be okay  by telling yourself it will not be okay or that it will go wrong you are hurting your confidence to do what you want 
 its hard to say from a post online what is at the root of this experience but you may be able to get insight into that as well as develop ways of coping with the distress of feeling this way with the help of a good therapist  there is no pill or technique that can guarantee that this experience will go away though it might however there are things that you can do so that you can understand it better and so that it does not have such an impact on your ability to lead a satisfy life 
 human beings are social creatures and rely on feedback from the outside world of people places and things to let us know more about ourselves  we also have an inner voice dialogue conscience etc

 the issue that i see in most of my clients is that they try to reason with this anxiety  you do not reason with sensory states in the body

 anxiety is normal for most when speaking in public  i hear this from even the best of facilitators who have been doing it for years 
 it is believed by many that our dreams contain metaphors that represent meaningful patterns in our lives and relationships and if we pay attention to them we can learn important things about ourselves  one thing you might try to see if you can get more insight into the dream and possibly begin remembering things is to take note of whatever you do remember any details about your experience such as when do you wake up from the dream how do you feel both emotionally and physically what are you thinking about when you wake up is there any pattern in terms of what happens to you in your waking life around the time you have this dream 
 see if you relate to those characteristics  i have a feeling you have suffered some form of loss in your life that you have not dealt with properly 
 as you stated everything was great then you started having low selfesteem thoughts and thinking  what is contributing to these negative thoughts? his actions or your past experiences with unhealthy relationships would be my question 
 often in therapy the things that tend to get in the way of our securing satisfying and lasting personal relationships will appear in some way in the therapy relationship and a competent therapist will be able to help you work through this anxiety in a sensitive way and eventually encourage you to seek out the personal relationships that you want  in group therapy you have an opportunity to have a relationship not only with the therapist but several other people who are all in the group in order to give and receive mutual support to one another 
 first and foremost look into working with someone who specializes in working with individuals with challenges surrounding drinking  this would need to be assessed first since if it has been ongoing it may be making the situation worse and given the time it has been utilized as a coping mechanism there is reason to believe that the structure of your brain may have been effected as has been demonstrated by current neurological research 
since a lot of your stress is directed to uncertainty of whether your wife is happy being with you would you consider continuing the conversation with her about your understanding of her answer to you?your observation that she says one thing and behaves in a different way is meaningful bringing your point to her attention would at the very least demonstrate her interest in showing and explaining her viewpoint about you 
 its not unusual to experience feelings that dont seem to match up with what your rational mind recognizes in this case it sounds like a part of you recognizes that the people around you do not find you annoying and bothersome

 if anything i want to commend you on the selfrespect you have in wanting to wait and share this most intimate of experiences with someone that will feel the same way about it  one of the most common distortions in our thinking is when we try to directly compare ourselves to others while these people and even those in your family share a level of closeness to you they are not exactly like you  they dont see or feel things in the exact same way as you nor do they share the exact same perspective 
 despite what most people think of when they hear the word assertive assertive communication is one of the best ways to manage interpersonal conflict as well as maintain personal boundaries  once we become comfortable with acknowledging our boundaries there is usually a followup whereby we realize that we have the right to those boundaries 
 i have to commend you on reaching out to get some answers on why you are feeling the way that you are feeling  a lot of people secretly go about their lives every day feeling this way because they are too afraid of what the answer might be 
 sleeping difficulties irritability and anxiety attacks all are correlated with these mood disorders  and it’s actually quite common for someone to deal encounter this during their lifetime 
 there are many possibilities in regards to what may be contributing to these things you are noticing and a competent therapist may be able to help  in therapy you may be able to gain insight into these experiences as well as develop strategies for coping with and eventually alleviating anxiety irritability and inconsistent sleep 
 it also sounds like the distressing feelings that you experience when you imagine what will happen for you and your current partner are pretty overwhelming  a competent therapist may be able to help you work through these difficult thoughts and feelings and find a resolution to this cycle that will feel right to you 
 being with him is serving you even if the relationship is less than ideal from being alone  being alone can be scary

 feelings are never wrong but it can help to understand where they come from and talk to someone who can teach you healthy ways to cope  selfharm is not the answer to managing those emotions you feel in your stomach 
possibly you are overlooking that your own self is someone worth talking to as well none of us are ever really alone because we are always with ourselves 
 when we have experienced such scary violations of our bodies  we may experience residual effects of fear for many years to come  this is normal natural and in many ways helpful  at least initially 
 even though thankfully your parents responded well to you telling them and you received treatment its possible and very normal for sexual abuse trauma to affect you in different ways as you age and develop  please see a therapist who can help you find the root of the anxiety 
 traumatic experiences can become embedded in our bodies as well as in our emotions  if the issue doesnt get a chance to get resolved within then external action doesnt necessarily take care of the problem 
maybe you simply are in groups or situations in which you dont care for the people or focus start by trusting your own evaluation of your true interest in being among the groups in which you are 
 but there are also lots of examples of folks who have successfully worked their way through this  so there is hope! in addition to the suggestion to visit your doctor who may prescribe a medication to help you relax there are many social service agencies who provide free counseling or take medicaid 
 they would have resources available to help in your particular situation  
 i would spend it with my family! easier said than done when we are living in a tomorrow kind of world right? its hard to focus on the now when we are so consumed in what tomorrow shall bring time management is a very important factor when learning to live life to the fullest! in fact this is a required course in undergraduate college now 
 it sounds like you are experiencing a great deal of anxiety that needs to be addressed by a professional despite the fact that you are unable to at the moment  i would recommend talking with another adult such as a school counselor that can offer you support in this area 
 i hope that the medication you have been prescribed has provided you with some relief  unfortunately i don’t feel that moving in with your girlfriend would alleviate your anxiety 
 certain anxiety medications can make you feel nauseous but i havent heard of any that cause mouth blisters so there may be some other underlying medical issue there  i would definitely talk to your primary care physician and whoever has prescribed the medication as well as a neurologist if youve suffered a severe head injury 
 on a very basic level there exists a primal need to protect them from harm  the hard part for parents is letting them feel those challenges and working through them as they get older 
 i suggest you have some conversations with your girl to figure out where she is getting the information that she builds anxiety around  i see teens who have heard teachers parents coaches etc push the highly selective colleges idea on kids way too much 
 helping your daughter with relaxation techniques like deep breathing or guided imagery would be a good start  also reminding your daughter that you see her doing so well in school and that most importantly you are there for her 
 its equally important to do some self exploration regarding your own thoughts feelings and behaviors towards making mistakes and how you respond to your mistakes  when she is calm ask her what a mistake means to her 
 it is a good thing that your high achieving daughter is calling out for help and that you are listening  the education system is wrought with social and emotional problems and there is a disproportionate emphasis on test taking scores and achievement in school 
basic listening is warranted here and would be of great use  
 she needs to know that god accepts her as she is  i can provide her with a knowledge of her godgiven inborn temperament to help her find her godesteem 
 we walk a delicate balance of letting go and giving autonomy to our teens get older  adolescents are learning how to be functional adults and its important to allow them to try and sometimes fail in managing their emotions 
 many of the youth i see in my practice are going through similar behaviors and concerns  if she feels like she can talk to you about this i think that is a great place to begin 
 there are simply not enough minutes in the day to get everything done  so they react by cuttinginto important times such as social interaction and sleep 
 based on your description it sounds as though she has very high expectations of herself and is pushing herself to keep up  i hear your concern and recommend that to start you provide her a space where she can express herself openly to you without judgement 
 her behaviors are worry some as you feel she seems to be approaching her breaking point  i would suggest speaking to your daughter about the situation at school and her feelings 
 as her mother one of the most important messages you can share with her is that she need not be perfect nor is it necessary  as a matter of fact failure and making mistakes are only opportunity to learn and grow 
 it sounds like your gut is telling you to help her find ways to destress  listen to your gutalways as her mom you know her needs better than anyone else 
 determine careerminded students tend to be very hard on themselves and can eventually become very anxious about things  whereas it is a good thing to be driven it can break you down too 
 the period of adolescence and emerging adulthood are tumultuous times for youth  and their parents  the pressure to fitin be liked and succeed could be some of the contributing factors for your daughters stress 
 i share your concern  people of all ages have meltdowns when they become overwhelmed with stress and the negative consequences of those meltdowns can definitely have a rippleeffect into other areas of our lives 
 it sounds like they’re experiencing anxiety from their stress  it’s always a good idea to check in with your family doctor 
 what have you tried with her in the past? as exhausting as it might be a good first step is to empathize and validate her feelings  
 i would recommend mindful meditation or yoga just the two of you  something you find time for in a weekly basis 
 but ask yourself this question is your daughters reaction to what is going grossly out of proportion with what would normally be expected if the answer is yes a visit to a psychotherapist might not be a bad idea to learn some coping skills and to alter our reaction to life  
 are you able to open this topic in conversation with her?also reflect on your own expectations as a parent  it is possible that your daughter is trying to please you by getting consistently high grades 
 the key word is adult  if your daughter can afford to join the family for a vacation thats great shes welcome to come 
 they are fun ideally  youre not violating a basic human right 
 when you have enough sense of self you will know how to deal with your family  therapy is an investment in yourself which affects your family 
 sounds to me like you are being treated more like a child than an adult  its time to learn about healthy boundaries and being treated like an adult 
 one thought i have is for you to create a mantra or a soothing statement to say over and over to yourself as you are being bombarded with this negativity and abuse  for example you could say living here is temporarily one day i will have my own place 
 often times we believe we have to allow a certain behavior because a person is family  this is not true 
 considering that you mentioned not having a place to go it may be best to address the problem as oppose to “just take all of it”  confrontation can be done in a healthy and effective way 
 when your parents cross that boundary and are verbally abusive you have to have a plan to stand your ground and act upon it  that plan may include a better job to afford a place of your own a domestic violence shelter if you are unable to provide for your needs a firm talk with your parents about your parental authority or other 
 this is a great teachable moment for your kids  how you handle yourself will be very important for your children to see 
in this case you dont seem to be the issue  sure living with your parents with your child probably is not your dream scenario nor your parents 
explain you are willing to hear their point of view only not when it is expressed as abuse they may not agree with your opinion and also may not want to change 
 i can’t say for sure your children are being abused but i can understand your suspicion since there appears to be a change your children’s behavior  i think it would be important for you to keep an eye on the situation incase you notice any other changes 
 in addition to addressing this delicately with your childrens father it would be wise to speak with your childrens teachers and pediatrician as well  please closely monitor the situation and express to your children that they can always come to you with any information and they will never be in trouble for confiding in you 
theres a lot of unanswered questions and other factors going on here that need attention  nevertheless dont hesitate to seek out legal counsel andor call 911 
 there are other you should be asking though  you said your fiance seems afraid of her ex 
the answer could be anything from some agreement the two of them made either formally or informally before you came into her life to residual sense of obligation she feels toward him as a parent or that she genuinely does fear his physical or verbal anger if she disagrees with what he wants facts are the best starting point to know how to handle a situation 
 i suggest contacting the school counselor and asking for an evaluation once she is evaluated and depending on the diagnosis she could be provided with treatment recommendations like occupational therapy reading glasses or assistance in class  these and more accommodations are enforced under the 504 act 
 speaking with your childs pediatrician as well as school staff may be the first places to start  you can request that she receive an assessment and evaluation with a subsequent treatment plan to meet any needs she may have 
 it can sometimes feel like your kid has a delay because of these different ways of development  if you have concerns about your child’s development then addressing it with the school is the best solution 
 an occupational therapist can determine if your daughter struggles with eyehand coordination visual processing or sensory motor difficulties  the therapist will develop a plan of care if your daughter demonstrates delays or difficulties in learning 
 i have seen children in 3rd and insome cases 4th grade who do not have learning disabilities write in the manner you have described there is however a type of learning disability called dysgraphia which can present in the ways you have described 
 i would also suggest having her vision checked by a developmental optometrist  
without knowing more about the context of your daughters life for example is she a new student to the school and class are there major stressors in the home environment does your daughter have friends does your daughter have the same problems she has in school when she is in other environments?also who is telling you she has these problems? are you the one who notices what you describe here or is your daughter or is her teacher telling you these facts?depending on your answers to the questions start to get clarity with the classroom teacher and the school guidance counselor as to the source of your daughters problem good luck! 
 for instance have her eyes been checked by an optometrist? she might just not like writing or coloring  she could be rushing through assignments so that she can spend time with friends play games or do something else 
 someone working with the school usually a school psychologist should be able to evaluate her to see if she needs extra help and to tell you more clearly what may be happening  
 also children tend to regress behaviorally when facing events and interactions they feel to have no control over this can be as simple as a loss of a pet a recent move death in the family andor as serious as sexual abuse and other things  if you have not spoken to the school that can be a good starting point 
regression can be indicative of some stress in your childs life so the issues she is facing should be examined seeking advice from your daughters pediatrician as well as a practitioner familiar with adolescent issues or perhaps play therapy can equip you with insight into the causes of the behavior and give you tools to assist your daughter in learning age appropriate social interactions 
it sounds like you are really concerned about your daughter because you have noticed a significant change in her behavior    its really a great first step that you are reaching out to get some ideas about what might be going on  
while friendships are key relationships they are not the only indicator of someone not developing normally is your observation and opinion that your daughter isnt normal based on other factors or just this one?if this is the only factor then start with reflecting on what circumstances may be influencing your daughter to socialize with younger kids 
 moving on then would involve accepting the end of the relationship and developing a civil relationship with your expartner as far as is possible for the sake of your childs development generally its good for a functional nonabusive parent to spend time with hisher child but only insofar as that doesnt cause your child unnecessary stress 
 your child needs you  statistics about fatherless children are staggering 
 it is important to handle it with care as it involves your children  when parents are attempting to coparent the clearer the boundaries and expectations are the easier it gets to effectively coparent 
 children have a way of making things their fault even when they have done nothing wrong  because of this when parents cut off contact the child thinks its their fault 
basically distinguish that your father relationship to your child lasts has great meaning for your child and as the adult the responsibility for managing this relationship falls on you your relationship to your ex wife took place between two adults and therefore you are only responsible for your own actions to repair the damage done to you 
 when parents get divorced they still need to figure out how to have relationship so that they can parent their child  we might divorce our partners however we dont divorce our children 
 if you suddenly absent yourself from this childs life then you may be doing real damage  working out an arrangement with the childs mother for regular visits the child can count on and committed to by both parents will serve the best interest of the child which i assume is what both parents are truly concerned with 
short version your child needs you as much as possible  period 
it is an unfair situation for both the person who has autism as well as the campers who do not to expect both sides to get along harmoniously in order to achieve this the campers would need specialized training to know how to respond to distress in the camper who has autism 
if youd like him to work with your suggestions then before you make critical comments be sure to validate his strong points and to recognize his natural talents people are much more likely to take advice if the person feels the criticism is spoken by someone who respects them and isnt only critical of them 
 you can continue to offer assistance for your son but it is ultimately up to him to decide what to do with the information or ideas that you are giving to him one thing you might try is to ask questions in a way that enables you to learn more about what he is experiencing 
 i imagine your mom was really shocked and upset  both of those things tell me you are a pretty honest person  its possible that your mom had a big reaction simply because she has learned that her child from whom she always assumed honesty was capable of being dishonest 
what do you think about telling your mom how youre feeling? she might really appreciate it if you also let her know that regaining her trust is really important to you  
 i bet that as you begin to show her that you are not going to lie any more she will begin to gain trust in you again! be open with your feelings with you mom  she is there to support you guide you and love you! give her lots of hugs  and give yourself one too for being so brave! be wise! 
 there are some great answers that give some guidance about what might be an underlying condition  if all physical and mental health issues are ruled out its time to take action 
 it sounds like she either has a medical or mental condition  she needs help and for the sounds of it you want to help her 
for how long has your daughter lived the way you describe and did it start all of a sudden or more gradually come on?what you write sounds like a major depressive disorder and this can start for a variety of reasons and improve in just as many different ways start with how you are feeling about the situation 
 shes an adult 2 
 there is some key information here i dont know your sons age whether he spent any money whether he put the card back or how many times hes stolen and my answer might be different depending on those details but ill give you my thoughts i see it as every childs job to figure out the rules and find where their power is in the world 
 i can’t offer advice without knowing much more about your particular situation but some things to think abouthas something else happen recently that has been stressful upsetting?is your daughter trying to communicate something to you and if so what might that be?have you discussed these recent changes with her? without being too serious or accusatorythere is so much changing for her and you nowcommunication and connection are crucial i hope you both can talk to a supportive person about all these changes 
her answer will give you some guidance as to next possible steps if shes pretending to be a fantasy figure or trying to find out how being taller feels or walking on high heels or some other image then knowing this rules out that she has some unbearable pain in her arch which may require more practical answers such as new shoes or even indicate a medical problem 
this question about how you feel about your third child leads me to believe you are dis turbed etymology agitated or stirred up  feelings are messages from our soul or spirit that something is not right 
 there are many reasons for attachment disruption  but attachment is important for the child as well as your long term relationship with them 
try to understand your own reasons for not liking your youngest child as much as the others one point to consider is whether it is the child personality or the way they interact with you which gives you the feeling of not liking this child as much as the others or does the reason have more to do with younger children requiring more care?also do you generally prefer older kids to younger ones? it is possible the problem will go away as your youngest grows older 
they may have worked so hard because they understood how difficult and tiring your life was as a single mom i feel you are seeing your kids lives through the measurement of how much toil was in your life as a single mom 
are you the only decision maker regarding your stepdaughter living with you?is her dad and your partner living under the same roof?would you feel any obligation to consult with your husband about his opinion and his way of handling the situation?have you talked with your stepdaughter about your observation and your reaction to the fact of her not honoring your boundaries?consider too that there will be an effect on the toddler your grandchild if you kick out your daughter is your daughter financially ready to live on her own and support herself and her child?you certainly have the right to define the terms of what goes on under your roof 
 it should be a joint decision if you value your marriage  you can mention your frustration about your stepdaughter not honoring boundaries 
 if you dont know where she can go there is probably a list of shelters for the county that you live in  
 if you are in school please consider speaking with a counselor on site who can help give you some good coping mechanisms as well as other resources i believe most therapists would agree that this type of behavior is indicative of emotional and verbal abuse 
its a little difficult to answer your question because the laws that define child abuse are different from state to state  but usually things like what you describe your dad is doing are not considered to be child abuse 
 there is no abuse without emotional abuse  his abuse is demeaning and can have lasting negative impact on your perspective of your self and people around you 
 having said that everyone gets upset once in awhile and may yell or scream which can be disrespectful  you said always and i mean always and that is troubling 
here are two points i suggest you consider for your situation if your dad is ever calm when you and him are with one another ask for some time to talk about your relationship with him 
 masturbation is a healthy expression of sexuality  most families to create some rules about where its ok to masturbate for example stating that it should be done in the privacy of the childs own room 
 sure sometimes kids dont get along but most schools look at bullying seriously and this sounds serious the other though is additional tools to consider to help your daughter 
if your partner doesnt work or doesnt contribute his money to the household bills then maybe you are eligible for some type of stipend from the government especially since you have kids the child welfare service may intervene to help you 
 first identify how to practice good self care which can only happen when you are authentic and real about your needs and desires  you cannot pour from an empty cup and must take find the time to explore your purpose in life 
do you know or can you find out what the grandma and your daughter were doing in the evening of the screaming episode?is it possible the grandma abuses your daughter or tells her scary stories watches scary movies  these are only suggestions of some problem between grandma and your daughter 
the variables are the way this child absorbs and adjusts to these significant changes in their life  all anyone can do is guess at this point and theres no good reason to guess 
 punishment is another word for wanting to cause hurt  there is a different in discipline and punishment 
 this can lead to issues in the relationship between parent and child as well as the childs social relationships  kids have a hard enough time 
 i have worked with a number of young adults in their 20s who have had to move back home after college  or even stay at home through the college years  bottom line is that either way  it is so difficult when you are trying to discover who you are and what you want your life to be  to have to live at home 
 even though legally you are an adult it is a matter of courtesy to respect the homes of your parents  as long as you live there you should be considerate of their needs 
 by living with your mom she is not going to stop her attempts at what you perceive as controlling  there is no use in trying to debate or get her to see your point 
 if you are still under her roof she has leverage as to what her expectations are while you are living there  i would consider therapy for the both of you to see if there could be a middle ground that could be agreed upon 
 it sounds like you and your parents are not balanced in your communication and awarenessofexpectations  your growth is not only reflected in your ability to understand and apply new knowledge and skills it is also reflective of your parents acceptance of your understanding and application 
 the first thing to under is that you can’t change who your parents are and cannot change their behavior  the thing to keep in mind is that you can control your responses and actions 
does your mother mean rules pertaining to the way your family household organizes its daily or does she mean something else?every household needs rules as responsibilities to keep the house clean who does the grocery shopping the way costs are distributed for this and all the other carrying charges and tasks of maintaining the house in decent order as well as respecting the privacy and noise level requests of others who live in the home this set of responsibilities applies whenever more than one person lives with another person 
if youre not in such a position and must continue for a while to live w your dad then emotionally protect yourself from him doing so is much more difficult than maybe it sounds 
 they often do in cases of abuse  your safety is the number one priority 
im glad you recognize hes handling himself less as a grown person and more like a young child i also understand your hurt and frustration that your father handles himself in a way which shows for now that he is unwilling to respect your wishes 
so what the custody arrangement? does your dad have full custody? is the custody shared?what does your mom think about the situation? is she willing to go to bat for you?what is your age? usually you have the right to choose based on age requirements set by the state legally you cant be kept away from your mom unless there is some legal complications that prevent it 
 it is not just for addiction and often we blame the ones closest to us  you can not stop them from blaming you you can stop yourself for taking on the burden 
how old is your daughter?who abused yours daughter?the answers make a difference to your decision obviously if the father was the abuser then unless your ex demonstrates to you and you believe he will not abuse her your daughter should stay with you 
 i would suggest focusing on connection  since you are not currently living together one way to do this would be to plan a date in which she gets to decide what you do together 
 it is also very likely that your daughter does not understand the permanence of death  having said that she is using some very specific ideas here and i would recommend contacting a local mental health professional with some experience working with children 
better to find out why she wants daddy to die than explain the future consequences of death to your toddler a person must be around 9 possibly 8 years old before absorbing the potential effects of an action taken in present time 
 i think it would be wise to have her seen by a child psychologist just to rule out anything more serious  
 they should be told for their own empowerment  knowledge is their power of safety and protection 
 there are what sounds to be real legal is this man a rso registered sex offender is he prohibited from being in proximity to minors? usepossession of child porn violates any  of state and federal statues  
 i have a very strong opinion here  in my book the safety of children trumps potentially insulting or hurting the feelings of adults 
 physical trauma is usually easier to identify but emotional trauma can be feeling a lack of emotional connection in her important relationships having experienced bullying or some other emotional injury  the fact that there are some defiance symptoms going on suggests that she might be in need of a safe place to process what shes going through and the potential issue with control or meeting emotional needs with food is also concerning 
 if the child is considered anadult by state law with regard to counseling states differ on this the range is typically between age 13 and age 18 no one is allowed tobe in the session without the childs consent second ethical and legal standards generally require that acounselor be in the role of a therapist or in the role of an evaluator butnot both 
punishment will most likely result in more of the same not less of the peeing you would like to stop from happening laziness is more of a social judgement than it is a characteristic of its own merit 
 instead of utilizing punishment when he wets himself provide contingencies prior to any accidents  sit down with your son and discuss the importance of utilizing the bathroom and responsibilities and inform him that if he chooses to wet his pants that his video games will not be available for use for him the next dayor your designated realistic time frame 
 parents can usually tell when their child is happy  but kids who are unhappy may be masking disappointment perhaps acting out their feelings in an aggressive manner 
is this something i should be worried about? should i do something about it?every mom is the expert on their children’s behavior  first of all i suggest checking with your son asking him if he is happy while playing alone or does he complain that no one wants to play with him? does he plays alone in school but is social in other environments with family or neighbors?playing alone is healthy for children it helps them to be independent and confident it allows them to explore their environment and use their imagination among other benefits 
 if he is happy on his own and you know he has some friends i would not be very concerned  however there may be bullying going on at school 
 i would request reports from all teachers and caregivers concerning socialization and make a choice on whether or not to evaluate further hope this helpsc 
is he happy or does he seem happy playing alone during recess?does he have friends in other social circles besides the students whom hes with at recess?how is his academic progress?how is his social integration among his classmates?are there any special or unusual circumstances in the home and family environment?go through this list to form a fuller idea of whether your son simply likes alone time and takes this option during recess or if any if the above areas show stress or difficulty for him and which need to be further understood and handled  
to some degree your daughter and you may both feel similarly misunderstood by the other developing ways of listening and talking to one another to better understand how you each feel would probably help a lot 
 the younger the child is in general the more i would see this as your decision not his  a child of any age should be listened to carefully about these matters but just because a child has unresolved issues about a parent doesnt necessarily mean that having contact is a good solution 
 your expartner unfortunately has the power to say things to your children that poison their relationship with you  its a form of woman abuse and child abuse 
 your daughters favor him because he has done no wrong in their eyes  im guessing they lived with you? growing up i was the same way 
 we tend to have big emotions around those we care for most  i would suggest to let her know how hard it is to hear that and sad it make you feel at times and that this is hard for everyone 
 although you dont say how old she isand i imagine that at some point in her life she will be ready to know the truth i trust your instinct that now is not the time  your ability to have clear boundaries about what is adult conversation and what is suitable for a child to know are really important here and i can tell youre being appropriately protective and a thoughtful parent 
 hes a lucky boy to have had you all taking care of him  certainly it seems that his mother might not be making the best decision for her son if you are willing to maintain the relationship it would be good for him to still have that contact 
 it seems very clear to me that no would be the appropriate response  i like your healthy boundaries and ill help you explore possible ways to respond to her 
if your daughter is willing to talk with a therapist then let her find out first hand if the sessions seem useful or not the one move id avoid is to force your daughter to go to a therapist since growing up in a household in which child abuse took place being forced may remind her of her own feelings from this past of feeling no one heard or cared about the way she wanted to be treated 
 it depends on that a good deal perhaps in my opinion a child should never be forced into a situation where they feel unsafe even if it is supervised 
 i appreciate your fiancés need to stay close to his child and be a standup dad and i am glad that you know your son needs an emotionally safe place im a bit confused because the obvious answer seems to be that you and your fiancé would get your own place together 
 its a passive aggressive act if done intentionally so i would wonder if this child is trying to say something i think without any context however or sense of whether there are other signs of disturbance its impossible to say whats going on 
 you dont tell us whether you live together or not  if you do your position is perhaps more difficult because his daughters behaviours affect you you live in the home 
 they must want that too if they still believe in santa into their teen years which is unusual i believe  i wonder if they had already figured it out anyway?but they know now and your ex had the right to tell them if he felt it was best 
 unfortunately there is no generic answer with this one  kids fight for different reasons  wanting attention wanting respect feeling jealous wanting space and to be left alone or a whole bunch of other reasons 
 you dont say how old he is so im not sure whether the problem is deeper but right his fears may reflect that right now he is simply be not ready to take that step  pushing him at this point could worsen the problem so i suggest pulling back the expectations waiting a month or two looking for more signs of readiness and trying again 
do your parents object to you and your boyfriend continuing to see each other in person? or do they object only to electronic communication and dont want him involved in his childs life?ask your parents what their reason is for forbidding you to communicate with your boyfriend  ask them also to understand your point of view 
one point to consider is to strive for moderation in what you offer in relationships a lot of what youve lived through is extreme either as victim or perpetrator 
 your love sounds deep sit with that  also sit with how shes been hurt 
 that is a scary situation for a parent  do you know if the child has been evaluated by a mental health professional? early treatment is often the key 
pay attention to all your feelings toward a girl so that you’ll approach someone who attracts you for reasons in addition to sexual allure also the process of knowing someone takes much more time than only to sleep with someone 
 without being able to fully understand where youre question is coming from i think there are a couple of different ways to look at this question first i think its important for us to consider the message being sent by those in your life stating that youre not good enough 
 in the healing process youll need to work on discovering the root source of where these thoughts and feelings come from and then learn to accept yourself just as you are unconditionally  id be pleased to help you in this process 
 it seems like that is affecting your inner voice which allows you to accept yourself for who you are my suggestion is to explore that relationshipand decide if that person’s opinion should determine how you feel about yourself 
 nor will it satisfy those that are critical and judgmental  i am so sorry to hear that this is what youve heard all your life! you are a human being not a human doing 
first of all please try to allow yourself some time for grief of the loss of your dear grandmother  it appears you were close to her in many ways and she had a great influence in your life 
 work relationships and housingsecurity are major needs for us and to lose all that at once has got to affect you  when things go wrong it is natural for us to look for blameand the easiest person for us to blame is ourselves 
 and having said that you wrote that you have been looking for a job so that tells me that you have most definitely not failed yourself  try taking it one day at a time 
 you want to not hate yourself  selfacceptance is hard! and its on a spectrum 
 when in your life do you feel the most confident? what gets in the way of you accepting and loving yourself big question!  you can and will uncover that confident self! 
 we are bombarded by media and advertisements everyday that try to sell us things to make us somehow better thus leading us to believe that we are not enough  unfortunately i believe that low self esteem is a social epidemic 
 i know it is quite painful and i can imagine that at times this pain doesnt feel like it will subside  but it sounds like it is not all the time which means we can easily say that this hate myself experience is one part of you 
a lot of times these feelings are the result of the people in your life treating you a certain way  you internalize it and accept it as your reality 
you already are at the first step of realizing that you hate yourself not that the feelings of selfloathing are the best of what youre able to expect from life a way to start building confidence is to pay close attention to the way you handle interactions and make decisions 
go slowly and tell your partner how you feel as you discover how being loved feels on a deep level you’re releasing yourself from interaction patterns which treated you poorly and unkindly 
 congratulations!i often hear people talk about loving yourself and self esteem  we often seem to blame ourselves for not loving ourselves enough or put ourselves down for having low self esteem 
 its tough to be in a healthy and loving relationship when we believe we are not worth it  quite often being in such a relationship is very uncomfortable as it goes against everything we believe about ourselves 
 it may be helpful to work through some of this with a local therapist so you can get more specific ideas some other things that come to my mind are maybe talking about spending about 10 minutes or so discussing how you are feeling and seeing if your partner is willing to listen 
 most of us come into relationships carrying old baggage and although you cant change her what you can do is change yourself  we can usually begin to understand ourselves better in the context of our own upbringings 
 i would not suggest breaking up with her without first attempting to resolve your own issues  you may not only regret your decision but might find that the exact same problem arises in future relationships 
even though you are quite detailed in your description of your partner one piece which is missing is whether you feel you are loved by her maybe too what she considers your insecurity is really her unwillgness to love you 
 you don’t have to have your parent’s permission to seek support for yourself! and maybe taking control of your support network will give you the strength to make even bigger decisions about your health! i am rooting for you! be wise! 
 finding that help at school or through your pediatrician could be the first step towards getting the tools to reach physical and emotional health  remember that the weight is only a number on the scale but your health is determined by multiple factors 
 oftentimes when we have overwhelming or difficult experiences as a child including poor caregiving the ways we managed and the feelings we had then show up in our lives as adults  especially when we get close to someone it mirrors our early experiences with caregivers in early life 
 with the information provided and not knowing what your childhood was like or what youve experienced i will say that from my experience working with people these feelings are normal and a normal part of the process of healing and just by posting your question tells me youre aware and desire to change this  very good! i commend your strength 
 what you are experiencing is common for people who have experienced abuse neglect or other forms of trauma  when people experience trauma they develop a feeling of shame and start becoming self critical 
both conditions you have been living under pressure to perform well in school and the tension of someone bullying you are quite draining now is probably time to recuperate from your emotional ordeal 
in a movement class such as pilates yoga aerobics weights dance when the standard for clothing is somewhat fitted and shows more of our physical bodies than regular clothing and to be considered as one of the students not stigmatized for how much or how little you weigh may help you be as accepting of yourself as the teacher is of you! 
  a lot of times we try to have the perfect body when in reality we try to live up to social standards  please set up a free consultation with me! 
 it sounds to me like you are carrying an enormous amount of emotional weight and maybe even an equally enormous amount of guilt and feelings of failure about your marriage  i cannot imagine how challenging this is for you right now 
 i am sorry that this boy said something insensitive  there is nothing shameful about your body and it was not your intention to display everything 
 you are putting yourself out there and becoming a water safety instructor  we often times will focus on the negative and forget about the positive 
 what did your instructor say? anything? if the outfit was not appropriate then the instructor should tell youif heshe didnt then assume the swimsuit was okay but the gentleman in the class wanted your attention and took it upon himself to comment in order to get that attention  if you dont want his attention then you have a couple of choiceswear a shirt over the swim top find an inexpensive swim top to replace the one you have or wear what you have as long as the instructor doesnt say anything and if you get unwanted attention say in as confident slightly loud voice as you can muster 
the key to feeling better is to realize that as long as you learn something for the future from your mistake then you will be doing all that any human being is capable of doing your mistake sounds genuine not that you were deliberately trying to create a stir or harm yourself or anyone 
 we know that it is possible to overcome embarrassment and selfblame but why does it seem so difficult to overcome it sometimes? if you tune into your own thoughts or your internal dialogue youll notice that your thoughts are connected to your feelings  so people who are holding onto embarrassment and selfblame often have thoughts like how could i do that? i looked so stupid! now people saw things i did not want them to see! if we tune in more we might notice we are thinking that this is terrible horrible and that we cannot deal with it 
as far as how to forgive yourself this is probably one of the toughest things that we ask of ourselves no matter the subject  on the other hand it sounds like the location of the mistake means that after you get through the class you wont see the same people much longer so hopefully the embarrassment will be temporary 
you dont say how old you are  its likely that if you are young your body will change as you mature but in general were given the bodies were given and im glad to see that there may be a desire in you to accept your body the way it is 
honesty is always the best policy but honesty comes with risk  perhaps you may want to start with your family first explaining to them what you have done and why 
can you tell your parents what you wrote here? if yes then maybe they will be empathetic and this always helps they may also agree to not make any comments about your boobs when you wear the bigger bra around your friends when they visit you at home 
 one question i would have for you is what is your evidence that people feel this way? is there anything in peoples words or behaviors that gives you this impression? if your not sure it may be useful for you to try to notice what people say and do in response to you even though you perceive these attitudes within them  additionally working with a competent therapist may be a great way to get an answer to your question as well as developing ways to move forward with that answer and gain a sense of selfesteem and security in your relationships 
 how about setting your own expectations for self and strive for those  make sure your expectations are reachable and realistic 
 is there something getting in the way for you? was there a time in your life when people teased you or told you something hurtful or did something to you that made you feel ugly? if so this can be addressed first  sometimes stories are told about us when were young and the best thing we can do is see the authors evil or careless intent and not take that on 
 im glad you wrote because i think a lot of people have this same issue to different degrees and we dont talk about it much  you have some social anxiety that is a bit beyond what the average person might feel 
 each week you sit across from someone who genuinely cares about you who doesnt judge you and who you can voice your concerns to  over time you show them more and more of yourself and as they get to know you they still care about you they still dont judge you and they still think you are amazing 
 we cant change what other people say think or do  we can only change our reactions 
hope this helpsc 
after allwe belong to a social environment where we constantly receive other’s feedback which at times validates us makes feel important and useful like we belong but also at times makes us feel isolated different and neglected which we could interpret as hate the key is to beaware ofwhat you think about what people think of you 
 do you have any opportunity to work with a therapist? it sounds like it might be really great to explore these feelings  if you arent able to there are many awesome gender work books available that you could use to explore your thoughts and feelings 
 so you if you are ready for a change  
 guilt is one of those things that nearly everyone has experienced at one time or another and it can feel like a huge weight around your neck  unfortunately it is unlikely that we can give you some words of wisdom that will make it all go away 
 as an example as a child we continously fall in an effort to learn how to walk  then when we begin walking we know we have to put one foot in front of the other in order to move forward 
 that is ok we all have  however the best way is to say ok i did it learned from it will not do that again 
 id like to throw in a technique i learned from randyrausch author ofthe last lecturecalled the 3step apology i teach this important bit of wisdom to my clients when they need to apologizeto someone else but more importantly when they need to forgive themselves 
 my guess is that you tend to come down too hard on yourself a lot  thats a huge barrier to happiness that you can work to reduce 
are there particular reasons for why you feel everyone hates you?have you been in a clash of ideas or opinions and feel yourself in the minority viewpoint?or does your sense of being shut out start within your own mind as though you anticipate that others will not like what you say?if actual conversations are leading you to feel left out then evaluate whether to bring up certain points to the other person or you may also decide that the relationships in which you feel shut out are no longer worthwhile ones for you 
 but i also do this when things aregoing well  that is i forget how good things can turn bad 
 knowing ones personal truth is always the first step in finding what is necessary to be and develop reflect a little more on the type of care youd like in your life 
 to know that we belong and are part of something larger  it is so important to us that when we feel alone  it can feel almost unbearable 
 i would suggest that you get to know yourself   what do you need in a relationship? what is holding you to this relationship other than your child? what have gone on in the relationship that makes you think or feel you deserve such disrespect? just a few questions to ask yourself 
 you are lucky to have a loving compassionate partner and your boyfriend is lucky to have a partner who takes full responsibility for their actions my hunch is that you learned some things about yourself when you were younger that are playing a role here 
 what do you think that he sees in you that allows him to do that? does he see someone who like other humans makes mistakes? does he see someone who despite hurtful choices is a good person committed to being a loving respectful partner? the compassion and understanding that we can often extend to others can be difficult to extend to ourselves we often hold very unrealistic and perfectionist expectations for ourselves which may even lead to our poor choices in the first place  as a ways of letting off steam or rebelling against our high standards 
 in working with a therapist you may be able to get insight into what is motivating these behaviors develop strategies for taking care of yourself and get a stronger sense of who you are motivated to be when you are your authentic self  
similar to you they are not on fb for the reasons you list  plus no one wants to go on fb and tell the world they dont have a fantastic life 
continue developing some points youve written here that you grew up sensing andor witnessing your moms emotional pain from your dad cheating on her very likely set a standard in your inner self to expect similar circumstances in your relationship life 
he did an ugly action and instead of feeling only your own emotions in response to being cheated on you are holding his ugly behavior within you and feeling it does this sound like a possible explanation of why your feeling of ugliness started after the cheating incident?you may start feeling better by looking within your own heart for the full effects of having been hurt 
 since you seem to care about your friend dont want to hurt him i imagine there are many other reasons that you are together  i suggest that you talk about this openheartedly with each other 
 this behaviour although it might get you the attention you want initially will ultimately drive men away because its not respectful of them  my gut says that you learned early on in life that your value is in your sexuality alone 
 from just your personal experience alone you might realize how easy it may seem to keep such a secret from those around you  in the same way there are many people who struggle secretly with this problem and not many people know or even notice 
 sexual assault or sexual abuse is a very traumatic event that affects victims in many ways  your difficulty in feeling sexually engaged and your description of the shame and selfloathing you feel are normal responses to the rapes you experienced 
 traumatic events such as rape can have some lasting effects  issues with sex drive are one of these effects 
if you have not already explained to your wife about what caused your great distress then please consider doing this  a conversation that happens in a safe relationship will give her a chance of being supportive to you 
in what ways does your boyfriend express his commitment and positive feelings about you to you?from what you write you feel more aggravation stress loneliness and insecurity than satisfaction by being in this relationship does he care that you dont trust him?very often people stay in relationships from fear of knowing who they really are 
 hating yourself may be a sign of extreme sadness feelings of loss and uncertainty do you know why you hate yourself?discovering your reason is the first step in knowing the obstacles and then the additional steps possible to move from hate to selflove 
this may be your self giving you natural time to recuperate from emotional pain also it is your chance to think over how to handle yourself differently in future relationships 
 im sure your doing your best to overcome this feeling but seem to be struggling with your own happiness  trust god no one else 
 emdr has been proven to be very effective in treating trauma  in addition a support group might be helpful to find a more stable support network 
 when you are aware of the negative thoughts or irrational beliefs you can then work on changing them  an easy way to recognize an irrational belief is a thought that contains the words must or never 
 a big part of the process however of strengthening your selfconcept is learning how to tell yourself those positive messages that you heard from your friend! leaving for college may also be contributing to your feelings of unsteadiness  try this  make a list of all of the positive things that you know are true about yourself 
i wish i knew a little more about the situation to give a better answer  have you discussed what is causing you to consider breaking up with your partner? based on the information giveni suggest starting off making a pros and cons list 
 without knowing anything else about the situation  it makes me wonder  what makes you feel like you should break up with him? what brought up thinking about ending things? it will be important to decide if the relationship is safe if it is healthy and if it makes you both happy  are there reasons you are staying in the relationship that dont make you feel good? it might be helpful to write things out or talk to a trusted friend about what each of your choices means 
 i recommend completing a compatability checklist to evaluate which areas are making you unhappy  it is important to discuss these feelings with your partner and determine if together you want to work on these differences 
 my advice is for you to consider what is making you unhappy in this relationship  sometimes we think we are ready to move on but dont know the reason why and then we regret it 
 therapy can help you have a space to be completely honest with yourself about your relationship as you grapple with your decision of whether to remain with your boyfriend  your therapist can ask questions to guide you in uncovering your true feelings about whether this is the right relationship for you and he or she can support you in whatever decision you come to 
 typically if we are contemplating if we should or not it is for a reason  to really come to a place of decision you need to know where you are right now what is not working what the potential resolution would be and if it is realistic 
 there are a few questions you might want to ask yourself like why am i asking myself if i should end it? what else am i looking for in a relationship that this one doesnt give me? is my boyfriend willing to discuss my doubts and willing to work at making this relationship better? is he abusive in any way? these are just a few questionsto think through in order to make this decision  also talk to a trusted friend and see theyre point of view of your relationship 
 it is important that you are aware of your personal deal breakers  some common deal breakers are abuse of any kind physical verbal sexual or emotional or substance abuse however anything that is detrimental to your well being can be considered a deal breaker 
when you ask yourself this question it shows you are not happy or have doubts about the way things have evolved so far  relationships require time and work for them to develop grow and flourish as healthy and fulfilling ones for both partners 
 one of the first questions you may ask of yourself and consider for your boyfriend is whether you are both willing to work on the relationship  a relationship no matter how great or hard cant work unless both people are invested in working on it 
 all relationships go through low periods where one or both people may feel unhappy in the relationship this is normal  what i tell my clients when they are facing this decision is to spend some time and imagine your life without the person in it 
 here are some things to consider to help you make your decision what is leading you to ask the question? has something happened recently or repeatedly that is making you question your relationship? if so what is it 
 spend sometime by yourself exploring the reasons for that unhappiness  are these things likely to change or not? 
 because even with the details its very hard to say as no one is experiencing the relationship in your shoes except for you  it might be helpful to process this in therapy or with your boyfriend directly and voice your concerns about the relationship 
make a list of what you dont like and then decide whether youd like to tell these topics to your boyfriend as a discussion about your relationship he may have similar feelings and together the two of you may figure out new ways to be loving with each other 
 so dont give up on hope however you knew i would say that there is a lot work ahead of you 
 i also believe that you are worthy of respect and love  im curious if you felt loved cherished and respected by your husband during your time together 
 we cannot control him his actions his love or his decisions  but we can work on you 
from your description there doesnt seem to be much hope your husband would like to keep the marriage going has a long time passed since the two of you separated?  sometimes and really this is very rare people decide to return to their marriage 
if you made reasonable custody terms re your son then the relationship heartache is much easier to recover from than if your son’s mother vanished from his life or if the mother wants nothing to do w him re the actual relationship let yourself feel sad and hurt since this is the truth 
 at the same time i dont understand whether you are able to see your son  im curious as to the relationship dynamic between you and your sons mother 
 she is the mother of your son and this new baby would be his half sister  i think telling her is mature and appropriate 
the mother of your son has every right as a parent to know who is directly involved in her sons life first figure out how you will handle your current girlfriends request to end the relationship you have with her 
 i think you should honor that relationship and then talk about it to someone the more you try to not think of it the more you will think of it 
the problem isnt releasing yourself from the person per se   letting go of a person means separating yourself from the qualities in a partner which you value 
 the good news is that people are capable of moving on from relationships even if the person showed them a sort of love that theyve never felt theyve had or deserved before  sometimes even just the fact that this has happened for them can eventually see below lead them to seek out love again because they now believe they will be able to have that again 
 then your road got a pothole now every time you drive you hit that hole and it only seems to get worse the more you drive over it  until that hole is patched  until you choose to fill your heart with either love for another or love for yourself  you might find it challenging to keep driving on your road 
 i believe each relationship we are in is an opportunity to expand and to know self on a deeper level  we are conditioned to believe that we are not valued or worth much without the confirmation of others and the world around us 
honor the love you felt for this person  acknowledgement of your love feelings will most likely help you find a dignified way to accept them while at the same time slowly developing new ways to live your life in a way which does not include the actual person 
 its a catch 22  you know mentally that its not healthy to think about them 
i like the fact that you are looking at your situation logically  feelings can take time to fade but you seem to understand even if it is subconsciously that its the feelings he stirred up in you that are keeping you tied to him not necessarily the person himself 
congrats on your intuition and following your intuition an engagement breakup is full of disappointment and sometimes talking about the particular points help the couple to clarify and possibly set the relationship on new terms or feel more confident in the breakup 
he may very well love you only with the ex so prominent in his mind it is possible your feeling of not being appreciated now would multiply if ever the two of you needed to address a delicate topic since he is emotionally attached to the former gf it is very likely he wouldnt be able to fully love you as much as youd like and are already sensing 
im not able to tell you whether or not you made a mistake because the decision is yours  i am wondering what led you to ask whether you made a mistake and whether you wish you were still in the relationship with this guy 
keep yourself protected emotionally from him   theres no good which can come by arguing with a person who flips their position 
it sounds as if sometimes your spouse want you to be a part of his life which could be a part of where the jealousy comes from and sometimes he doesnt  talking about this would likely be a delicate conversation and from what you mention he has been diagnosed with im wondering if he has a therapist 
 it is a matter of one or the other becoming complacent  if you and your husband have been together for quite some time its likely that you are very comfortable and familiar with each other 
 would you and your husband be willing to attend couples counseling during the separation? that would benefit you both  if you separate and reconcile what will have changed other than you having time apart? you will need to gain new skills to enhance and maintain your connection  otherwise you will risk repeating the cycle of disconnect discontentment and separation 
 in it i offer 7 expert tips to help you get started on a path of self connection and discovery  this is important stuff to do in order to work through that stuff thats holding you back from the relationships you desire 
 you seem to have some good insight into the situation the type of behavior that you are describing is usually rooted in childhood issues with insecure attachment bonds with your caregivers childhood trauma andor abuse or neglect or dysfunctional family issues that did not allow you to develop healthy boundaries for yourself or a sense of self 
keep understanding yourself during your moments of doubt and anxiety  its fine to feel terrible and certainly better to know you feel insecure than to act upon the insecurity by being with men who take advantage of you 
it also sounds as if it may be helpful to discover more about yourself in addition to what you look for in a partner as far as emotional abuse it may be useful to develop communication skills that you could use prior to their relationship progressing to the point that it is emotional abuse 
  people cheat bc they feel diminished regard for their partner you pulling away doesnt explain his behavior 
 everyones different in moving on  first what can i learn about myself because of this painful time? caring nonjudgmental family and friends who listen with the head and heart help a iot 
 having obsessions after a breakup are very normal and many of my clients experience them  it can help to create a distraction box and when the obsessions present themselves use your distraction activities 
when we lose someone were saying goodbye to what we thought our future was going to be  accepting thats changed and allowing ourselves to envision a new future is necessary to move on 
 we have high hopes and then those hopes and dreams are dashed and we feel at a loss for how to deal with this sudden change in our lives  first it is important to acknowledge that losing a relationship is a loss and we need to grieve that loss 
 when relationships end however it can be devastating  it is normal to go through a grieving process after a breakup 
 im sorry youre feeling badly   the first thing is to be really sure you are taking care of yourself  that means eating well exercising getting good sleep spending time with friendsfamily and making sure you are taking care of important things like work rent bills etc 
 recovering from one is a process that is unique for everyone person and will take time  its important that you dont compare yourself to others 
 that means no checking out your ex on social media platforms and no contact  in order to move on and diminish the obsessions help yourself recognize and accept that the relationship is over and make sure to get sufficient support in processing all your feelings 
 there is no timetable or known length of how much time a particular person requires in order to feel that the dissolved relationship is behind them probably the more you allow yourself to acknowledge your sadness from seeing the reminders the sooner you will feel fresh and new again 
when you feel ready and if you feel this would help then consider to talk to your sister from perspective to improve the relationship the two of you have since the ex is gone and the sister is an ongoing person in your life this particular incident is only one in many which the two of you will have with each other 
i can say that divorces can be difficult or confusing for everyone involved  while the divorce is most impactful for the couple going through it the divorce itself also changes extended family dynamics 
certainly she is confusing by telling you she likes you and is with someone new  and not giving you any explanation as to why she made her decision 
 there are lots of levels of relationships from a basic acquaintance to a more friendly acquaintance to a friend close friend best friend early romantic partner committed romantic partner and many more if she is willing to have a conversation with you about her feelings it may be helpful to have her explain her feelings to you while listening as an investigative reporter and asking questions that cannot be answered with yes or no but are what are called openended questions which ask her to provide more information 
strange for someone who was treated badly to describe themselves as bored rather than say they feel hurt is it possible you are being selfcritical about your behaviors toward your ex girlfriend?either she is unaware of her feelings or not being fully truthful with you about her feeling badly treated 
probably you didnt actually forgive him because if you did then you wouldnt have been asking questions of his every move maybe you were open to forgiving him 
 howeverit takes time to heal your pain  you are not a robot that can just switch off your emotions 
  one of the things to consider is give yourself a chance to go through the tasks of mourningto accept the reality of the lossto process the pain of griefto adjust to a world without the person who has just leftto find an enduring connection with that person in the midst of embarking on a new life 
it is possible that since you love her and would like to be together again that you are misinterpreting your former partners actions if youd like to have more certainty as to wether your former partner is cheating or whether she is happy to be with the new partner is to contact her and ask her your question 
the person who must repair the trust is the one who has broken this trust the best way to find out if your husband wants to restore your trust in him is to ask him this question 
 it seems you are in a set of circumstances that are highly uncomfortable for you  do you feel those circumstances are healthy? do you find pleasure being in such a place of uncertainty? why do you continue to be in this situation? without meaning to appear that i might be lacking in compassion you do have the option to leave the connection completely if the harm it is doing is more that the pleasure it brings you 
 boy ending relationshipsis tough isnt it? sometimes its tough even when we are 100 sure that it is the right thing to do!i am going to give you some of my thoughts and hopefully some colleagues will add some others  one of the things that i want to point out is that letting go is not really a thing 
 understand your reasons for staying in the relationship three years is a substantial amount of time to be involved with someone 
 it is understandable that when we are hurt in relationships we may have trouble trusting and allowing ourselves to be vulnerable with others therapy is a great place to explore the roots of present difficulties in relationships to unpack what happened in prior relationships and to find new ways to show up in relationships so that we can have the relaxed intimacy that we want 
 i hate to sound harsh but i am a therapist that call it how i see it so brace yourself  
 that is something that most men struggle with doing at times  time will tell if his actions are of good intentions 
concentrate more on what youd like from your marriage  this will naturally raise the questions and criteria of what to talk with your husband about and what to ask of him 
 its more of the fact that he isnt ready to give that life yet  
 there is definite value in being clear as you are about your own emotional investment in your husband and that you expect sexual exclusivity from him as part of the foundation of your marriage also positive is your awareness that only your husband is the one who must similarly decide his own standards of being sexually exclusive to you or not 
dont be so afraid of your fear that you let yourself beg and are willing to accept unhappiness as a standard in your marriage if you start considering that life can be better than what is current for you now new possibilities and ideas will start developing in your mind 
 you may have passed these things off as being the normal ups and downs of a marriage but whatever it was or wasnt its obviously bothering your wife  i would say yes keep trying to fight for your family at least until you know what the problems are from your wifes perspective and if theyre repairable 
 i think that it is normal to struggle to get your feet under you again after a divorce especially after leaving a relationship that lasted 11 years so try not to be too hard on yourself  take it one day at a time and do the best you can 
 after reading your question i wondered how you went from making out to nothing happened? i wondered if this happened because of an emotionbased thought that sounded like if he liked me he would make something happen  a truer and more empowering thought might be i want something different to happen with him and i want to take a different action to see if that can happen 
theres a difference between an agreement between you and the childs father to not view porn and with you monitoring and setting standards for your childs fathers way to handle his social life try to accept the limits of your request extends to you and the childs father not the way the childs father wants to handle his relationships with other people 
 although you do not like inappropriate content it is not up to you what your childs father looks at or what his friend sends him  it is really hard not to monitor other peoples lives but in the end your rights begin and end with you 
 although it is challenging to supply an answer without knowing the full situation it might be helpful to have a more broad discussion about what you both think about the influences and images that your child is exposed to and what you think your role is in protecting your child  this situation is one about beliefs and values and could well be an example you can use for exploring your parenting roles in protecting your child 
 it is tricky to know how to handle workplace conflicts but there are typically resources in place to help employees and mangers communicate successful and feel confident that they are being treated fairly at work  is there an hr department that you can use as a mediator? 
 it is emotionally dangerous to be at a job for a lengthy duration in which you feel overworked and underpaid  you will not perform well as you mention and thus your selfesteem will continually take a hit without really any effort 
 if seeking another career opportunity isnt viable there are a couple of things you can do to manage stress on the job 1 
 workplace stress is one of those areas of living that troubles many people who need an income to survive  the interactions between you and coworkers is a mixed bag and sorting that out can be difficult 
is this your dream job gone sour or a just pay the bills deal that has gotten stale? it makes a big difference in terms of next steps for example if this job is a step on the way to a bigger goal it might be time to assess whether you need to be moving along to then next phase 
 there are some aspects of this that are in your control and others that are not  what type of work do you typically enjoy? do you enjoy high stress work? what keeps you in this job? is there a reason you have stayed? is your boss reasonable to have a conversation with? i recommend a few things 
sometimes overworked and underpaid is tolerable bc of the valuable learning which the person will take with them when theyve decided the time has come for these lessons to end or are you in this place bc it is an easy commute to your home or fits well with other parts of your life such as education or some health related program?as long as you have a good reason to be there you will feel there is good purpose 
 sometimes the element of power and unavailability can heighten our sexual interest but that doesnt mean its a healthy idea to pursue someone who is in a position of power over you at your workplace  
 in the workplace a boss usually has the power to hire fire set schedules approve vacations and evaluate performance  because of this power dynamic most employee handbooks expressly forbid supervisors and their direct employees being in a romantic relationship 
 that must be very frustrating for you to feel that you to be reminded of constant wrongdoing in your relationship especially when you feel that your wife does not admit to any fault  this could lead you to feel inadequate in the relationship that can harm your relationship in the longterm 
it is possible you are a balanced couple in the sense of neither one of you understanding the other the deeper question to ponder is whether each of you can accept the other person even though you each have very different terms for defining cheating 
 i would recommend to take the time to self reflect on what exactly it is that you are doing that is contributing to the mixup  you both have very valid feelings and those wont magically go away until you address the root problem which could be many factors 
 it really is up to you to decide if you owe him the 25 00 
 it is something you will remember for a long time and it shapes how you begin to think about yourself as a worker  you are literally learning as you go in this completely new environment 
did the matter between you and your boss get resolved?do you feel respected by your boss and does she listen to your point of view even if afterwards she disagrees?keep an open mind over the next several weeks or few months on how you feel in your new work situation expect to be treated fairly and reasonably 
 employers can suggest or something stipulate in continued employment with them for you to go to their employment assistance provider eap if they have noticed the same behavior and concerned of how it is effecting productivity or employee relationships  no one wants to work in a environment which they consider hostile 
 i believe most government agencies have an employee assistance program eap where employees can talk to a therapist about any issue not just workrelated for free up to a certain amount of sessions i’m wondering thoughwhy your coworkers would tell your boss this if it’s not true 
 on the one hand you want to get over him on the other you are still holding out hope for something more  it will be really hard to let go of him and create friend boundaries so long as there is a part of you holding on to the idea of something more 
most often staying engaged in dialogue affection sex with someone who has different reasons than you have for doing so creates longing frustration and sadness since the guy has told you he would like limiting his involvement with you more than likely you will be protecting yourself from disappointed wishes by taking his words seriously 
 if you want to maintain your friendship and continue to have regular contact with him getting over him may not be possible  what makes it even trickier is that his actions hugs and touching may be misleading and are allowing you to believe that a romantic relationship is possible 
there are however a few types of counselortocounselor relationships that are prohibited by the ethics codes  such prohibited relationships include those between supervisors and supervisees between professors and students or any time the relationship might negatively impact your or their clients 
 for example one person may define himself by his values and morals while another identifies herself by her personality and characteristics  still another person may define himself by his interests and hobbies 
 were already 100 there  what we do have to do is become more mindful of the times when we feel the most alive most happy most creative and most fully engaged with life 
 by the fifth day i noticed i was light headed and felt very strange  i began to realize within my own being an experience of no separation 
 a competent therapist will work to create a safe and curious therapeutic relationship in which you can explore your identity  there are also many different exercises which you can do in and out of therapy which you may find helpful in this area as well 
 there is a part of you that you can access anytime anywhere  it is the part that has always been with you 
give yourself the freedom to your interest in having interests  are you motivated because of competing with others or because an activity itself feels satisfying?if you are able to develop a sense of defining yourself without fear of judging yourself you will start coming close to knowing who you are 
if you are talking about learning more about religious or spirituality consider either going to or speaking with someone who is involved with a nondenominational church service the salvation army usually has something so you can discuss questions or ideas that you may have as far as finding yourself in general i suggest considering what makes you happy andor comfortable 
 we are fluid beings we are never the same from day to day we learn or unlearn we evolve or some of us even devolve we are in a state of constant flux changing and adapting like a cloud in the sky that has its shape changed by the wind life whittles us away and carves us constantly trying to understand this question is like trying to bite your own teeth however we can have a sense of what we would call our core and to understand the core we need to live and to experience but also to think deeply analytically and critically by engaging with life we get a sense that we are like the earth itself inside of us there is a core just as there is inside our planet but our continents shift and change over time like those continents so does our own nature shift throughout our lives  
 if you feel comfortable enough to ask your parents to see alife coach or a therapist this may be an excellent place to start  you don’tneed to tell them the reason why maybe say that you simply need someone to talkto for support with school or homework etc 
you remember the previous lifes connection with the masculine experience and body and wish to find a way to be more comfortable we will approach this matter spiritually and i reckon youll feel a great deal better  
 with that said it is also so important for you to be safe  it may be helpful for you to find supports in your life community or online that you can talk about how you feel and potentially gain supportive persons if your family does not accept you 
 a parent knows their child  
 unfortunately many unjustly ostracize members of the lgbtq community away from faith and spirituality  i believe that folks can embrace the identity that is genuine to them and still maintain their spiritual beliefs! briefly the keys are to first monitor how we allow those in our life to influence our thoughts and emotions 
however difficult painful frightening it is to tell your family about your discovery about who you are trying to avoid your own truth will do you harm eventually one way to make this conversation easier for yourself is to prepare yourself for the outcomes you expect and know will be difficult 
 i know how isolating and lonely this can be  the most important step you can take right now is building a community of supportive people who do accept you 
 being that you mentioned that you both come from a christian background maybe you could start there he needs to forgive and trust your love for him  his insecurities stem from something bigger than you not being a virgin 
 if you are speaking about jealousy he may come from a divorced parent upbringing may have seen parents cheat on one or the other may have had partners cheat on him in the past  he may have fears that you may go off the straight and narrow once you get married 
 you cannot change that for him  he will have to do the work to handle those emotions on his own 
 i am not averse to religion i just think that many times it puts unreasonable expectations on us and helps us to form a guilt complex or perhaps even insecurities we are humans and humans make mistakes  you mention the straight and narrow this is a notion that you must give up on and let go humans can never travel the straight and narrow for their whole lives there are bounds to be mistakes we are the most fallible species on the planet and please tell your fiance to have some mercy on himself he is not perfect 
everyone accepts a new understanding at their own particular rate  yours may be faster than his pace 
 the best way to build a great relationship and have a great future believe it or not is to be firmly placed in the present  that means that when we stay in the moment with our partner and can notice what we are experiencing in the here and now we reap the best benefits of that relationship 
 if your fiancé wants to learn to live more in the present and learn to let go of the past or move in a different direction you can certainly assist him but you cant independently make it happen i wonder if both of you would be willing to have a discussion where he is able to explain to you what he is experiencing and you are able to listen for five 10 15 minutes in a way that is not blaming or pointing fingers or asking him to change but just listening kind of like an investigative reporter so you can have more details and ask questions that you may have about what certain things mean when it feels like to to him when this is discussed etc 
 spirituality religion god higher power and many other parts of this discussion mean different things to different people  my question for you is what does real actually mean to you? often the concept of god has to do with what you believe in 
 this is a significant issue for many people and can make us feel helpless among other emotions due to the uncertainty  you said that at times you feel like everyone is lying 
 god has been developed over time as a security blanket for our childlike selves the world is a beautifully brutal place and what is more reassuring than a master that will take care of us and show us the way  on earth alone there are thousands of gods and even many more systems of thought economics societal structures and so on it is almost as though it were a supermarket with so many choices we have more choices in gods than we do flavors of ice cream at baskinrobbins so then i ask you which one is real? and what is real? 
 to help answer your question let me begin with the premise that you will never have absolute proof  with that being said one can look at different phenomena in nature and history and figure what is the statistical probability that they happened randomly 
no one knows if god is a lie because god is a concept in which people either make up their own definition of this concept or believe one of the concepts of what god is handed down by religions all the religions exclude the other god concepts and expect loyalty to believing in their particular version of god 
 there are many opinions out there for and against god’s existence  but the real question is not if god is real or not but do you want to have faith and decide that he exists? this is a personal choice 
 mistakes can be forgiven and you can make amends but it is not the end of your relationship or gods will for you 
 i would say the first thing you want to do isif you havent already have a calm reciprocal conversation with your parents telling them how you feel and lettingthem know what you need from them  if communication attempts are unsucessful then you will need to make a decision with how you would like to move forward 
 although everyone may not agree with one another the most important thing you can do for each other is to respect their faith and beliefs instead of trying to sway them in a certain direction there are many families that are united despite their differences 
 are you creating one? many families have various members who have different spiritual beliefs and religious practices  accepting the idea that those with whom we are close may be different from us is the only way to create a world of peace 
 you are accepting your past you are not denying what happened to you you are talking about the past  you are already doing a great job of starting this journey 
 sometimes it doesnt feel safe enough to share the information until the person who hurt them is far away or even dead trusting and vulnerability are difficult especially when weve been hurt 
 it may also take off the pressure you feel to complete your own trajectory of making peace with your past burdens of ilife if you find your possible new partner is patient and understanding then youve both removed pressure off yourself and will feel validated and loved for speaking your plain truth and finding it well accepted 
 however just because you are not able to feel or express emotions does not mean that you do not have emotions after such a traumatic event that you experienced your central nervous system goes into defensive mode dorsal vagal nerves that protect you from any further harm 
 its very normal to stop feeling emotions as a way to protect yourself after experiencing a traumatic event  you can think of it as emotional shock you experienced something that was so awful that you have numbed yourself mind and body as a way to stop the emotional and physical pain of the event 
 please rest assured that you are not a sociopath and that your reactions are normal responses to traumatic events  im guessing you are experiencing a sense of numbness which is a common response to trauma 
 when we go through a trauma it is natural for us to shut down as a way to protect ourselves  a kind of freeze response 
 when we are pushed to the extreme and we are unable to escape we “freeze” which numbs us from pain but disconnects us from our bodies  we oftentimes continue to feel that disconnection until we work through these traumas 
 sometimes when a person experiences a traumatic event an event called dissociation occurs  dissociation is the brains way of temporary creating and increasing emotional distance between what is happening and what you are feeling and experiencing 
 rape is an aweful experience and i am very sorry that happened to you  when horrible things happen people often react in a way that interferes with the ability to live a normal life and function the way they did in the past 
 it is normal to feel a range of emotions after a severe trauma including no emotions at all  try not to push yourself to feel just notice the lack of emotion you are experiencing right now 
clearly you realize you have pretty deep emotions and have lived through several severely distressing situations your sense of self may be protecting for a while until you recover the practical aspects of daily life and feel some sense of predictability and stability in your life 
 shutting off feelings is our brains automatic way of protecting us when something bad happens and we just cant deal with any more pain  its temporary  which is both good and bad news because after the numb goes away and your brain decides youre ready to handle it youll feel the emotional pain 
 you havent suddenly become a sociopath  this is a normal reaction to an event that is completely overwhelming  there are most likely too many feelings to feel right now so your body in its wisdom is shutting them down 
 it is very possible that a car accident could lead to an increase in ptsd symptoms that were related to other traumatic experiences if you have been deployed to a combat area you are most likely eligible for free counseling services through the va vet centers 
 it is good that you recognize the possibility of this occurring not everyone who experiences a car accident develops ptsd 
 without treating the traumas or incidents where you felt there was a significant risk to your safety or that of others there can be a cumulative effect  what we have learned in the mental health field from studying traumas is that the body as a whole responds to these stressors in order to keep you safe during the events 
 especially if it was serious you could have feared for your life felt everythingvwas out of control and had normal reactions to an abnormal situation afterwards this may or may not be related to the traumas that you experienced in the military 
 yes a car accident could increase ptsd symptoms such as hypervigilance anxiety nightmares replaying the event etc  depending on the severity of the accident new triggers might exist 
 ptsd can be very complex and debilitating  it must be very difficult for you at this time 
 this can be a really scary feeling  it is a common reaction for individuals who have endured a traumatic experience 
being traumatized means not feeling safe in almost all areas of life be patient with yourself as you try to regain trust that people will not harm you and will be sources of satisfaction in your life 
 please know that you are not alone and with the right help you can overcome these challenges living with ptsd can be very emotionally exhausting but you can learn ways to cope with its challenges and findfulfillment in your life again 
 i know that from personal experience  recovering from it is possible and doable!first is step is to acknowledge to yourself that your ptsd symptoms are a normal reaction to an abnormal and traumatic event 
 you may need the guidance experience and support of a professional to identify all the triggers that effect you and obtain the best coping skills that would work for you  
 it takes courage to have posted your question and that is the first step  here is an article i wrote a few years back 
one suggestion is to develop patience with yourself and the process of regaining your willingness to trust other people sexual intimacy engages all of who we truly are 
 somatic experiencing brainspotting and internal family systems therapy are all highly effective treatments for people dealing with complex trauma  if you are interested in reading a book that is supportive and compassionate bessel van der kolks the body keeps the score is a wonderful book that discusses treatment options in depth 
this can be either strong positive or negative feelings she may be fearful of becoming more intimately attached to you and withdraws 
 i think its wonderful that you are approaching this with openness and curiosity  the reaction you are describing is extremely common in survivors of abuse 
 we may find ourselves feeling guilty that we did not see it or that we couldve have done more or something to stop it but often the fish in the fishbowl cannot see that which is closest to him  you are currently trying to numb your feelings those feelings as nasty as they are are meant to be felt those feelings help us to process the event and also help us to pass through the situation 
 as im sure you understand alcohol and marijuana may take the edge off of the pain in the short run but in the long run they may prevent you from being able to work through the thoughts and feelings that you have about the loss of your friend  grieving is a process that is unique to each individual and each relationship that may involve difficult confusing and even contradictory seeming thoughts and feelings and a competent therapist can help you work through this process 
 suicide is difficult to understand and those left behind have many mixed emotions that make their grief complicated and anguished  your friend either had an impulse that no one could stop or they made a big decision that impacted everyone around them 
 everyone deals with their grief in different ways  one way i recommend to deal with the loss of a loved one is to write letters to them 
 i can understand how difficult this time maybe for you especially if you have several unanswered the questions due to the circumstances surrounding the death of your friend  its during this time that you may experience the various stages of grief 
 there is such a large feeling of uncertainty that befalls those of us left to sort through these emotions of such a loss and its never easy  i think its important to remember that there is no right or wrong way to deal with loss and the best way for you may not be the best way for someone else 
 most people go through the grieving process  i would get a better understanding of what that process is 
everyone has family legacy patterns of behavior and ways of handling emotions handed down to them simply by living all of what any child observes and how they are treated within their family context creates their foundational expectations of others 
 the good news is though that the effect doesnt have to be negative  im met many people who have horrific pasts and it helps them know confidently every day what kind of person they want to be and what kind of world they want to live in and it helps them make really great decisions 
 having past traumatic experiences creap up on you without warning can be very scary and stressful  you may be suffering from symptoms related to posttraumatic stress disorder 
 all past experiences both positive and negative are what have brought you where you are today physically and emotionally  that being said your fathers behavior does not have to define you or your future 
 getting to know yourself after a trauma especially at the hands of a caregiver and learning to trust yourself can feel terrifying  i would encourage you to seek out a trauma therapist who can work with you slowly and at your pace 
 even consensual sex can be experienced as an intrusion if a partner was not careful or insensitive to your pain  it would be normal to have some difficulties with sex after such an incident 
 your body is yours and yours alone  i would highly recommend that you find a therapist who specializes in treating trauma in order to help you to heal from your ordeal 
 my heart goes out to you  please find a therapist who specializes in working with ptsd 
 if the abuse included verbal or psychological condemnation you will often have a negative selfimage that you may know is not true but often feels very true  this negative selfimage and fear of being abused again can activate protections in you that were needed at the time you were abused but now create a wall in your current relationship 
 you mention that youre the one who ended the relationship in the past yet are haunted by nightmares and flashbacks  your comments here lead me to wonder that you may have experienced some form of trauma in this past relationship and if so i would encourage you to additionally consider the whole of your storyline as it relates to trauma 
 it would help if you have the opportunity to speak with someone on a regular basis until the symptoms of your trauma have subsided  
 if you are able to connect with them via touch or focusing on their tone of voice that may help to center you  tried to stay grounded andor mindful 
 if you are unable to find a local emdr specialist then i would suggest some meditation and journaling in addition to talk therapy to process your trauma  your anxiety response centers int he brain are in hyper vigilance mode and retraining to turn down that response could be helpful for you 
 our brains tend to replay scenes in our life that we wish had turned out differently or in an effort to desensitize us to it  if you are comfortable with it you may want to consider sharing what youre experiencing with your current partner so that he is able to understand whats going on 
the nightmares and flashbacks show that you were deeply affected emotionally and on the foundations of your basic nature the way for these to stop is by the slow process of realizing how badly injured and frightened you were of your former partner 
 people seek approval from others in an obsessive way when they are failing to truly accept themselves  i encourage you to truly love yourself and know that you have every right to every sensation emotion thought and inspiration that you may have 
 treatment of trauma is like surgery it requires a skillful clinician to help resolve it  while you are contemplating getting help you can focus on calming techniques like meditation and yoga 
as far as feeling scared when you are alone im not sure if you are referring to having flashbacks or thoughts on what happened to you or reminders in the environment around you or something else one thing that might help is to find a bead or a rock that is smooth that you can hold onto or rub against your hand or fingers 
 there are a list of them herehttpwww natboard 
 if you feel able to it may also help to open a dialogue with your boyfriend about what you need from him when you have these flashbacks  let him know what some helpful responses may be 
 you may want to consider seeing a therapist who specializes in trauma to work through the abuse if you have not already done so  often times triggers still hold such a powerful effect when the emotions related to the abuse have not been fully processed 
 ptsd is best treated with the help of a mental health professional and if using the cognitive processing approach can be treated in as few as 17 weeks  as for your other concerns many of these can be treated independently if you have the motivation to manage your way through 
 getting help and having someone to be there with you through the ups and down of ptsd makes the journey much easier  
 the blur in your memories is your brains attempt to protect you from the experiences in your past  to recover them can be a slow process done by a trained professional that you trust 
your blocked memories are a selfprotection from the enormous emotional pain and feeling destabilized by realizing that the people whom you expected to trust are harmful already you are at the first step which is to know that memories exist about the disturbing events concerning your brother 
dont allow some random professional to pronounce your boyfriend as cured  a relatively qualified therapist would never make this call 
 there is no technique or pill that can guarantee these thoughts will go away or be reversed however there are things that you can do which may help you to change your relationship to the thoughts and to the distress that they cause  i understand that working with a therapist sounds risky given your experiences and at the same time a good therapist may be a beneficial resource in helping you deal with the intrusive thoughts cope with and alleviate the stress that they create and perhaps even lead to the alleviation of the thoughts themselves 
 hypnosis can be a valuable tool that a trained therapist can use to bring back suppressed memories  however keep in mind that hypnosis doesnt work for everyone 
 what you are going though sounds overwhelming and exhausting  here is a link that talks about the signs of an abuse relationship if you are questioning whether or not you are experiencing an abusive relationshiphttpswww 
i would take very seriously that she doesnt show any willingness to hear and understand your point of view in a relationship in which one person claims the right to verbally abuse the other there isnt much genuine care and trust going on at all 
if she gets angry and then calms down a little while later maybe one of you can take a timeout in the discussion and set a time when you will come back to it discuss what it is that you find acceptable for you to do during an argumentdiscuss what it is that you find unacceptable for you to do during an argumentdiscuss what is acceptable for her to do during an argumentdiscuss what is on acceptable for her to do during an argumentyour partner can answer the same questions related to herself and you 
 i’m sure this is all overwhelming and frustrating for you  the biggest thing you can do for your friend is to be supportive as you are already doing 
 all of this sounds overwhelming and confusing  all of what you discribed is common in an abusive relationship 
 to address your question the best answer is that it will take time and from what i read you are still living through it  so your feelings are perfectly normal for the situation  i get the impression that you really need someone to process through all that you have been through and unfortunately getting adequate feedback would best be done meeting one on one with a therapist vs 
 i’m not sure of all the details so take from answer what you can  if you are feeling unsafe or scared in your relationship please know that there are non profit domestic violence services that can help and provide you some more support 
 often in an abusive relationship the person who is being abused starts doubting themselves and starts tolerating then accepting abuse marriage is based in love and feeling taken care of by the partner 
 even abusive relationships have positive moments in them and typically for survivors those are things they still love and care about of the abuser  a lot of it could also be grief over the loss of the relationship and also your children 
 it is important that you encourage your siblings to seek assistance with a therapist and maybe help them find one they should have school counselors available and if not our college counselor may help you to get referrals  it’s also a good idea to talk to your mom about the issue and ask her if she would like help as well 
 if they are affecting you the the point where you feel like you need to do something you may want to consider processing your memories of the events with a trained trauma therapist  another good option may be to attend a support group for survivors where you could process your memories in a safe space where others will be able to provide support and understanding for what you went through as well as encouragement for the strength it took you to get out of that relationship 
 first things first i am so glad that you are alive and very sorry that you had to endure such a terrible experience  now lets talk about these nightmares 
 there are some exceptions to the general rule of confidentiality however  for example when a therapist has a reasonable concern that a client or someone else is in imminent danger he or she is generally allowed to disclose confidential information to protect that person 
 what strikes me in your question is that you describe several ways in which your husband is hurtfulabusivecontrolling with you and then you ask should we call it quits?  we? i wonder if maybe the first step is for you to start seeing this decision as yours rather than yours together 
 i meet couples who seem to have all the ingredients but cant make it work and others who have severe issues and they decide to make better decisions and things change  but in reading your story the image of a slot machine came to mind 
 the first step here is that you are taking some responsibility for your behaviours  i do hear you minimizing your actions you say you dont hit her enough to cause harm? but youre headed in the right direction 
 regardless of whether or not your girlfriend leaves your relationship taking control of your anger needs to happen sooner than later  if left unresolved it will follow you into any relationship you have 
 unfortunately without a batterers intervention course or a desire to change the abuse cycle is unlikely to stop  i do not recommend that you try to leave on your own due that being the most dangerous time when in an abusive relationship 
 you have to ask yourself why you dont want to leave her  is it because of the child? or is it because you want the relationship to work? you must consider that being in an abusive relationship is not healthy for you or your child 
this seems to be a very unhealthy relationship  in my experience relationships such as these rarely become positive ones 
 however i highly urge you to do so because longterm childhood abuse does have negative consequences for your life as an adult as it seems you are already aware there are confidential and free crisis hotlines that you can call that deal with sexual abuse 
  accepting that a person is permanently gone from this earth is unsettling and can feel painful that you had no current contact with this person doesnt exclude the meaning or feelings from within your relationship with this person 
 anger is not usually just anger  behind our anger may lie rejection grief loneliness a longing to reconnect etc 
 now that you know that you snap and push people away you can look into ways to control your anger  if you give yourself the time to analyze why you experience anger you will discover that there are other feelings underneath shame frustration disappointment and fear are some of the feelings that we cover with anger when we are not ready to deal with them or don’t know how to express them 
 some people seem to really provoke emotional responses in us  one thing to learn for a quick review of yourself when you are provoked is to pay attention to your body 
it is possible each of you triggers the other in very deep and irrational ways on occasion if the choice is to tolerate being triggered or to dissolve the relationship then your decision is which of these two choices is better for you 
 its not anger that gets us in trouble its the overtness of the emotion or how we allow it to manifest that gets us in trouble  being able to control your temper depends on several variables how you saw anger acted out as a child in terms of your primary caregivers and what you internalized as being normal in terms of managing conflict and your communication style regarding how you confront problematic situations 
 they see someone they love behaving is frightening ways  thats a good reason to want to manage your emotions differently 
  if you cannot control your temper who can? you have more power of your emotions thoughts and feeling than you are giving yourself credit for 
 when anger is experienced often or the magnitude of it does not fit the scenario such as your losing comb the question becomes what does losing that comb mean to you? in the very split second that you have realized the comb is missing there is a reaction that occurs within you accompanied by an image or thought that like lightening flashes so quickly that you may not be aware what it is  as sherry noted below awareness 
 it is such a strong word  however i would say that you have an issue that needs to be addressed and controlled before it directed at the wrong person and gets totally out of control 
your answer to the question is what matters since you already understand that your reaction is overstated to the events which trigger them the reactions youre having are more than likely anger that is leftover from past events either in the near or distant past 
 he is the one in the position to change his violent outbursts   they are his behavior not yours 
 childhood trauma carries its negative effects into our adulthood and affects everyone who loves us your question is brief so ill just try to give general answers as best i can 
 the more you try to avoid certain subjects the more likely they will come up between you at worse possible moments if you can get ahead of the pattern of old topics coming up without your control then try scheduling a discussion about them 
 i agree with you!maybe he felt so overwhelmed by anger hurt and frustration that he went back to an old behavior from his past in which someone hit him for having strong emotions now that the incident is past bring up the topic to him so the two of you can discuss it 
 consider what else you may be feeling at the same time and keep track of your different mood changes  you may be able to notice patterns such as being more frustrated when you dont sleep well 
 if you are angry and you can talk about your feelings that would be very helpful  anger usually comes along with something else like feeling sad worried overwhelmed confused and many others 
anger is like a blanket that contains other emotion from bursting out and serves as a shield to protect us when we are not able to manage external issues  anger also helps us understand that there’s something wrong that needs to change 
 dont take his reports lightly  for him to tell you he knows that something is not right 
i wont label this occurrences as normal yet it is important to note these things do occur  my first observation is to say that it is a tremendous advantage that your son is communicating what he is experiencing 
 before he becomes your husband you should examine these areas and see if they are high in rating  otherwise yes this relationship will affect your girls and you negatively 
 you can start by accepting that this is who he is and you wont change him  you can only change your own behaviours and i see you taking responsibility for those which is great 
anger whatever the magnitude generally reflects emotional pain that has not yet been placed into words try thinking over your growing up years because maybe you will discover certain repeated dynamics which upset you and that no one helped you feel secure through such times 
there is extraordinary strength in being willing to notice your effect on others and consider what changes are possible start on the inside track of your own heart and mind 
 i wonder where the anger is coming from  learning what is atthe root of it can shed some light on what the problem is and can provide somerelief in itself 
 relationships dont tend to last when we treat people poorly  it is very possible for you to learn different ways of relating with some strong effort 
sometimes the family in which someone grew up did all they could to stop the kids from knowing who they were in some families there were very severe consequences if a child spoke up with an independent mind 
if youre sleeping beside your partner who does these actions would have a different response than if you overhear mouth breathing and snoring from a family member who is napping on the couch and you are walking past them on your way to take a snack in the kitchen basically if the person who does these actions which bother you start by telling them 
since you ask what is wrong with me? there is a disconnect between what you are doing and what youd like in return this is true even with imagining doing harm to others 
 a surface situation like a store told you theyd have delivery of a certain item by tuesday and when that particular tuesday comes the store doesnt have what they told you they would and you are furious the fury may have more with many times before in your life having been deeply let down by someone who mattered to your life at the time who similarly promised something and failed to deliver whatever it 
 it is also really good that you understand where the source of your anxiety and stress comes from  fortunately there are many self help books and internet sources that provide free tools to help you cope withlifes obstacles including anger management 
 ideally parents are people who tolerate that their kids are people with their own unique characteristics everyone likes feeling loved by their parent 
 it doesnt feel good to be angry all the time and its stealing your energy as well as affecting relationships im sure working with a therapist you can learn to recognise the deep emotions that lie underneath the anger 
 typically by not reacting right away we are better able to gather our thoughts see the situation more clearly and from other perspectives and respond more calmly  one of the strategies that almost always helps is deep breathing 
 it sounds to me like your husband is going through something and i think you understand that  you might feel very helpless sad and disrespected at the same time 
 im glad you wrote  in general when a small thing bothers us and this happens to all of us its because the small thing triggers an emotion in us that we have felt too much or too intensely in the past and we dont know how to manage that emotion effectively 
emotional awareness basically means knowing what you are feeling and why emotional awareness also means that you can identify the link between the way you are feeling and your actions 
since we cant really control the nature of our dreams while theyre happening we try to alter them while we are in a waking state in a nutshell this refers to first writing out in detail the events of a recurring nightmare you have 
besides having some type of relaxing bedtime routine to set a peaceful mood for your sleep and avoiding viewing violent films and video games as entertainment maybe even avoiding news stories which sometimes have similar themes of violence the content of our dreams and nightmares is out of our direct control your nightmares may offer useful clues as to what youre trying to resolve in your life 
 i know you said that your doctor said it is not related to your physical condition but have you tried speaking with your primary care physician? ive seen people with many different symptoms that end up being related to acid reflux or something of that nature  as far as the out of body experience there are different stages of sleep so if this is happening in the middle of the night and you are waking up from a dream you may not be fully awake when its going on 
 you are clearly aresourceful young person to reach out like this to find help  good for you 
 it sounds like thedreams and difficulty sleeping are reminiscent of previous experiences you hadaround the time of your break up the difficulty with your father’s businessand your mother’s health issues  these connections to past events may beimportant insights to continue exploring in addition to finding out more aboutwhat your dreams may be trying to tell you 
 thats great that you have added this in your routine  have you also considered altering your diet? certain foods are linked with poor sleep 
 i find that change states while sometimes difficult are very exciting  they give you opportunity to grow more rapidly 
if youve got a lot going on in your life then your dreams are your assistants in understanding these happenings and dynamics  
we remember dreams i believe because dreams are messages always in code from the unconscious communicating the crux of unresolved conflict between who we are and who we think we are supposed to be  you might be remembering so many dreams because your conscious mind is ready to hear these messages 
dreaming is a normal and healthy part of the sleep cycle  the current thought is that we all generallyexperience roughly the same number of dreams  the difference often is justwhether we remember the dreams or not 
start with short time spans of expecting yourself to concentrate  youll more likely succeed with concentrating with small time spans than longer ones 
what you are describing is one of the most common scenarios i see in my practice with couples one partner feels terribly lonely and unimportant in response to the other partner either turning towards other people and activities or being withdrawn and turning inward my mind immediately goes to a question for you what happens when you are feeling alone and uncared for? what do you say to yourself about you about your spouse and about your relationship? what do you do in response to these feelings? do you ask for what you need? does this lead to arguments? do you stay silent or withdraw?very often couples enter into negative patterns where one partner feels afraid of rejection by the other partner and so withdraws from the relationship and is often seen as cold and aloof towards the relationship and the other partner feels afraid of abandonment by the withdrawing partner and so pursues the other and is often seen as critical and nagging 
surveying the demographical data on longterm relationships its pretty common for couples to start to struggle around the 710 year mark and in fact thats often when first time divorces happen  and for lots of reasons 
 see if he relaxes and opens up to you even a little bit  dont try to have a heavy conversation or even unburden yourself to him during this first conversation  just try to be lighthearted and focus on hearing him 
 are you and your husband able to talk directly about your feelings? the way two people connect is usually by talking with each other to understand what each one cares about and thinks your current emotional suffering is the natural result of being married to someone who shows no interest in doing this 
 the more you know about each other especially your everyday lives creates a bond between the two of you  much like the saying goes in the military the same is true for a couple complacency kills 
 wanting connection with your spouse yet feeling the all too familiar distance thats keeping you apart can be so hurtful  but change is possible 
 your question shows that you are going through a lot of pain and im sorry for that  many couples go through this disconnect and hope to come to reconnect before things get to a breaking point 
 this is the idea that you feel like you are living with a roommate and no your partner or spouse   it is not uncommon for members of a couple to report to feel both physical andor emotional distance 
 i dont know how much time you actually spend together but one thing you could try is to spend 15 minutes a week together talking about common interests or other things that make you feel connected have you considered a date night or anything doesnt have to cost a lot of money but could make each of you feel special?something else you could try is to consider talking to each other in a way where you summarize what you are hearing and reflect back to make sure that you got it right rather than just assuming so 
clearly since youre writing on a site which offers psychological and emotional support and guidance you do not consider your gf to be a whore she may not realize or considered that you are somewhat protective of who sees her body 
 it can be helpful to keep in mind that alcohol lowers our inhibitions and for first time threesomes or any new sexual behavior really we humans tend to enjoy a little extra oomph to our courage levels  that being said it also lowers our ability to make well thoughtout decisions 
try to distinguish between your feelings of excitement from the novel sexual arrangement and what you feel is necessary in order to feel emotionally close and attached to your husband  
 evaluate the status of your relationship with each other  are you having issues? fighting? not feeling satisfied with each other? how has your sex life been with each other? if there are any problems insecurities issues introducing something like this may only make your relationship worse 
 as you have courageously explained your soulful dilemma  i can appreciate the complexity of this situation 
 nervousness when doing something new especially something sexual that can feel so personal is very common  indeed despite the fact that nervousness can be uncomfortable it is also part of the excitement of trying something new 
marriage is its own unique existence dependent on what the partners want from it examine your terms of satisfaction from the marriage 
 but it seems like there is something that keeps you with your husband  and i have so many questions for you what are you looking for outside of your marriage? are you willing to give that up if your husband is not able to provide it? do you want to stay together and make it work? do you want to open the lines of communication with your husband so you could analyze the situation together?i suggest attending couple’s therapy or even couple’s mediation to assess and discuss where you want to go whit your relationship 
whether or not you should get a divorce is not the first question that comes to mind for me but more along the lines of do you want to be together and what kind of relationship do you want to create?for some people polyamorous relationships those involving more than two people are acceptable  this does not work for everyone but if each of you agree that that is okay it may work for you and your husband 
1  i would recommend a complete medical examination including blood test 
 you dont say whether he complains or not but even if he doesnt it seems theres a sense of something important missing for both of you most likely to connect better with him physically youll need to become better connected with yourself and your body 
the key is your and your husbands satisfaction with the amount of sex you are having and know if there are reasons besides low sex drive that possibly explain this 
first different people have unique levels of sex drive and sometimes there is a hormonal imbalance because you say both that there is a possibility that neither one of you actually knows what youre doing and you want to be better connected with your husband consider having some time where you sit together and touch each other in nonsexual ways and communicate about what you like and dont like 
 i would take some time to explore your own body notice what feels pleasurable and play with different ways to achieve orgasm on your own  explore your own willingness to be open emotionally sexually and to play and have fun 
 sexual intimacy is an important part of many peoples life but how much importance is placed on it varies from couple to couple the first step would be to have an open conversation with your husband 
 the one aspect i tell many folks that i work with is this every person and relationship is different  there really isnt a normal amount of sex a person should have or want to have 
 this is really frustrating to hear but you will never 100 be able to guarantee that he has given you the truth  so if you can work on accepting that breathing through thathe may not fully remember he may have lied to you in the past or he is lying now 
 in my experience he was lying and trying to cover it up  by pushing you to std testing hes distracting you so he can shift the guilt he feels and blame it on you 
the reality is you wont ever know  mostly because of the various versions your husband has provided you infidelity though painful does not have to kill a marriage 
 one thing is for sure though not knowing and having this uncertainty in your heart will push your husband and you further away from being able to repair the marriage  the best thing you both can do is seek professional help to navigate this issue and start doing damage control 
the question you did and can answer is the reason you would doubt your husband which is bc of his multiple stories ideally your husband cares to restore your sense of confidence in the stories he tells you 
 how will things end if you find out he had sex with a prostitute? will you leave? will you try to work things out?the multiple versions are concerning  he seems unable to be truthful and this is damaging your relationship 
from the brief description you write your husband has very limited capacity to recognize how others feel and even less capacity to empathize with the person the best you can do is convince yourself of your own worth and associate with others who believe similarly about your qualities 
 you can not change your spouse but you can respond to his behaviors in ways that protect your boundaries and ensure your safety  this is very hard to do without support 
 in a largest study conducted to date about 1015 of women and 2025 of men admitted to being unfaithful while in a monogamous relationship  you are not alone and you can get through this just like countless couples have done before you 
 how sincere is he with wanting to work it out?that means alot in recovery  the key is to understand that cheating is a choice 
 thank you for your question  many couples that experience infidelity in their relationship face this important question  is it possible for us to get past the cheating or should i just move on?deciding to stay or leave is such a personal decision one that only you can make 
 im sorry that this happened to you and that you are struggling with making a decision about this  in my experience a couple can absolutely overcome cheating and get back to the relationship they once had 
since your trust was broken your fiancé would need to earn back your belief that he is faithful to you do you feel he empathizes with how you felt to find out about his cheating?before you have this question answered based on what you write there is a sense of your own doubt as to whether you are with the right partner 
 the short answer to this is not only is it possible to have a satisfying and fullfilling relationship after infidelity it happens more often that we may know  the current rate of infidelity is high while its not important to go into many reasons it mau be important to know you arent alone in this! my biggest suggestion for you would be to seek out a professional counselor that specializes in working with couples healing from infidelity 
 sometimes feelings about the betrayal may also trigger past wounds  the fact that it only happened once may not make it any easier to move forward 
 its usually jarring  i encourage you to give yourself some compassion about emotions that you have 
 both partners need to be feel motivated enough to repair the relationship and dedicated to the work needed to address whatever underlying issues led to the serious breach of trust  for some people cheating is an absolute deal breaker—for others the context of the cheating allows them to see it as a mistake that they can forgive their partner for 
 i think the first and most important question you need to ask yourself is do you truly believe in your heart that you can forgive him and trust him again? once you answer that question honestly then you can move in one of two directions  first if you truly love this guy and see yourself being with him long term and for the long haul so to speak 
 there isgenerally no lack of uncertainty anxiety fear sadness and anger  these areall normal emotions and being allowed to feel them is the beginning of thehealing process 
maybe next time you start to like someone talk with the person to find out if they feel similar to you  this way you have a good chance to avoid being hurt in the way you describe here 
 the sudden withdrawal of these is certainly possible to trigger a reaction like the one you describe  
your husband may not know want to know or want to discuss with you what his true feelings are toward you and the ex the topic is very heated which is why discussing these matters alone may do more harm than goodusually people start deeply complex emotional matters discussion and get so upset the conversation goes off track and unintended hurts happen 
 ask your husband if he wants to stay married to you  if he says yes then it would be helpful to go to a marriage counselor and work this out with a professional 
there are so many maybes that the best way to strengthen your relationship is to ask your girlfriend if she feels any pressure from her family to avoid involving herself with you if the answer is no then continue to talk with each other as to what would make you each feel more secure with one another 
 because this much time could be scheduled ahead of time at least you would know there was that time that was set aside  that may also help you to rekindle some conversations between you 
that your ex bf has trouble accepting your gesture as kindness shows your ex bf is not seeing the situation clearly i believe your ex bfs words about feeling burdened by your action 
i see why you would want them to reach out  i also wonder about how close he was with his friend and what he thought you meant when you asked him to reach out 
 a few things may help with thattry having the conversation you are both able to have a conversation about something that is important for example not during a commercial for a tv showmaybe your boyfriend will be willing to listen to you for about five minutes asking questions to learn more about your experience kind of like an investigative reporter wouldsee if your boyfriend is able to capture the essence of what youre saying by summarizing it for youremember that hearing you and following what youre saying does not mean that he agreesalso consider if there are events in your past that are affecting the way you are looking at this relationship between your boyfriend and this other girl we all bring our own histories into relationships and we unconsciously expect that what has worked in other relationships will work in current onesthen you can switch so that you can hear more about what he is experiencing for example what it is that he likes about heralso consider having a discussion that if one of you becomes very emotional and needs a break from the discussion discuss having a timeout that will last for a certain time frame usually between 15 minutes and one hour and then come back to continue the discussionremember that the goal here is just to learn more about what each of you is going through not to find a solution right awaythis can be difficult  consider working with a couples therapist to discuss it together 
there isnt anything you can directly do to stop his relationship with this lady it is possible to influence his side of their relationship 
 when faced with these kinds of difficult challenges i usually encourage people to look to their values for help in determining what their behavior should be  indeed it is usually when our behaviors conflict with our values that we dont feel very content with our lives 
 regardless of your sexual attractionorientation id encourage you to get honest with yourself and your partnerfiancee and put a temporary hold on your wedding plans  getting married will not resolve your acting out  it seems to me you need more space time to sort through with an experienced therapist more of your sexsexuality storyline and apparent anxiety surrounding the upcoming nuptials 
you gave yourself the biggest clue as to where to start solving this problem since you dont know what to do then for right now postpone your wedding date 
 are you getting something from the other men that you do not currently receive from your current partner? such asis itmore exciting with others and that excitement is lacking in your current relationship? 
 if your fiance is not ok with an open marriage it would be a good idea to seek the help of a counselor before you get married  
having said that some people have feelings toward people of more than one gender that are not really related to romance or attraction but any number of other feelings such as trust and communication  i dont know whether your use of the phrase messing around was related specifically to being romantically or sexually involved with the people who you are or referring to or if you are saying that you are enjoying spending time with them 
step one is to understand a true friendship which is based on trust is probably not possible with this person if youd like to offer words of advice to protect her from herself then try gently pointing out that some of her actions which you know about may come around to harm her 
 you will feel good knowing you did the right thing  
 consider making an appointment with a local therapist to discuss what you are going through  
 you must be extremely frustrated and heartbroken  to begin he is correct 
 each time we have a breakup we are a bit more in touch with how much is at stake in this whole love and relationship business  we are falling in love and letting someone close to our hearts and theres a vulnerability in that we can get hurt 
 it is your choice to participate in an abusive relationship  you can not stop an abusive partner from being abusive no matter how wonderfully you treat your partner 
its pretty common for members of a couple to have different ways of resolving conflict  very often one person wants to deal with the conflict right away or shortly thereafter and the other person wants to wait 
 but if he doesnt reply it sounds like its just as hurtful though more in my opinion in terms of the longerrange effects on the relationship  the behavior he is exhibiting would easily pass for passiveaggression as it is manipulative and controlling through passive withdrawal behaviors 
when a person shuts down and withdraws the only choice is to withdraw yourself   if this continues on a regular basis after a while the two of you will become increasingly distant and have developed the very unhappy habit of not clearing the air between the two of you 
 you can ask yourself  what am i learning from the way i am being treated?  and consider whether or not this is in fact either 1 a message or value that you agree with and believe will strengthen your relationship and help you to grow as a person or 2 a message or value that is damaging to the relationship or to your view of your self and others  once youve considered that and come to your own conclusion you will likely know what you need to do 
are you able to tell him how his flirting affects you?maybe he doesnt care enough to change and maybe he does long term if he continues this then usually people feel they have two choices put up with it which of course greatly reduces the sense of satisfaction in the relationship 
you know you are not getting the amount of love and kind of relationship youd like it is almost as though you feel that something is better than nothing 
be glad something within you is telling you that there are better ways to be treated than how your husband does for support and guidance in real time look up the organizations in your area which help women to leave abusive relationships 
 being able to assertively identify express your wants and needs to your boyfriend may be helpful in times of negotiation  often couples focus on recounting all the negative traits and issues when is time to negotiate and that impairs the ability to explore and find solutions objectively 
 but it sounds like you may be feeling stuck in a pattern of pushing people away and are wanting to change that  pushing others away may be your way of surviving relationships and may have proven to be very helpful at one point in your life 
think over how major a problem this is to you and if it is reason enough to leave the relationship there are always plenty of areas of disagreement between partners in a relationship 
otherwise how would you actually know whether hes lying to you now or not?start the conversation with him about wanting to trust him and asking for whatever details you feel will give you confidence he is telling you the truth if he really wants to clear your doubts then he will be willing to invest in answering your extra questions or wanting to look through his phone or whatever areas you felt were violated by him in the past 
ask him what he expects from you so that he will trust you again if you are consciously willing and do try to earn back his trust and have periodic conversations with him on whether he feels more at ease with trusting you then after a few months of this both of you should feel more secure in the relationship 
 if the other person does not appreciate your effort and good will then this feels dissatisfying offering happiness to someone does not include tolerating mean comments such as the ones you describe here 
one point to keep in mind is this just because hes not telling you his opinions doesnt mean he doesnt have any opinions 
your friend and the boyfriend are doing what is natural for couples who are in the early stage of their relationship  being almost inseparable to the point of overlooking friends is understandable as long as it doesnt continue for long enough that friends feel hurt 
 if he tells you he isnt lying and you have proof that he is then you can either accept that he denies the truth or not  
 for example you may want a relationship where honesty listening compassion and romanticism are major parts  you could also see what your boyfriend wants 
 human sexuality can be incredibly complex at times e g 
not only will you potentially feel more deeply connected from a sincere conversation about your sexual questions maybe this increased emotional closeness will inspire the sexual closeness you wish to receive  
  by trying to control whether or not you visit your mom unless you are in agreement with this is building tension between you and him ask why he resents your interest to see your mother 
 you are both under 18 and your age is appropriate for a relationship  there would be a possible problem if she was 10 or younger 
 that term is reserved for older adolescents attracted to children or adults who are attracted to children  i see an age difference as being one key factor in determining pedophilia if the older person is still in adolescence 
  a 15 year old cannot be a pedophile because youre not an adult also if you mean girlfriend in a romantic way then this makes sense bc romantic relationships include physical attraction to the other person 
 you are not a pedophile  you are both under the appropriate age where it would be seen so 
 youre under 18 too  youre only a year older than she is 
 i think the most important part of what you mentioned was that you do it because it makes you happy  for that reason i would encourage you to keep doing what makes you happy 
your problem sounds more a matter of timing and reason to tell the girl about it not keeping a secret is a good attitude regarding meaningful parts of your life 
 if you are comfortable with your kinks and fetishes if i may call it such not my intention to pathologize in any way though then be as open as you want to be  but i also dont know that you need to be announcing it as part of your online dating profile because you do say it bothers girls i ask out which to me implies that that is what youre leading with 
 i would not suggest that you hold back and keep it a secret  you should be upfront about it but perhaps gently bring it up on a date 
 its better to weed out 10 people who cant accept you to find that one who can  
does he care that youre upset with him for drinking more than he can handle?does he care about you more than drinking?living with an alcoholic which is how his behavior sounds is lonely and frustrating concentrate on what you like about him as he is now with his drinking 
 the one thing that struck me was the sentence he had a alcohol addiction in the past  addiction is not something that comes and goes 
 he says hes willing to cut back on the drinking but he drinks and hides it  his behaviour is passive aggressive and immature which puts you into this position of having to act like a disapproving parent

i wonder if the two of you would be able to have a conversation about what it is that she would like you to know about what happened yesterday and the day before so you know what message she wanted you to get out of all of that i would also recommend seeing a local mental health professional 
it is best to decide any serious matter through reflection and discussion start by knowing what you want from the marriage and why you are willing to move in or out of your own house because your wife tells you to do this 
 the good news is there are ways to deal with this you may have already answered your question 
 it could be part of how you were raised it could be because of culture it could even be your own insecurities about yourself that are then outwardly manifested in you pushing him away what is important in all this is that you both find a way to connect

 do you want to measure your trust based on knowing how many female coworkers your husband has? and if so what does that say about your marriage? trust is something that we earn based on our actions and the actions of people we interact with it’s also based on our ability to communicate and understand what we value and have in common  if you are focused on every little detail around your relationship it may turn into an unhealthy obsession and it may harm your relationship more 
 what would you tell her? if i were her best friend id tell her to run the other way you may love this man

 yes because he broke a boundary of yours that he knew was important to you  the question that should be asked is are you able to go forward with your husband with his behaviors not changing for the better in regards to your feelings and emotions? 
i dont know whether he would be open to having a discussion with you about your concerns about this and whether you would be actually willing to listen to your thoughts about it this might be something to discuss with a local therapist so that you can look at the patterns of lying in the past as well as whether you have a way to discuss this with your husband in the way that you would feel comfortable feeling vulnerable with your own feelings and also listening to what his responses are 
 is he in therapy? does he recognize that he has a problem and is he trying to repair it? even if he truly forgot to tell you about the woman at work i think the real issue here is trust  i am not saying that he doesnt have a lying problem 
everyone has their own tolerance for lies and their unique reasons for being married  trust your own answers to the question you ask here

 it could be that you are showing caring in a way that doesnt quite match what she is really looking for in that moment  for example having an indepth conversation could be something that you want but she may just want a hug in that moment 
what you describe holds the seeds of classic abusive behavior which is blaming the partner for what in fact are the persons own responsibilities start by withdrawing yourself from paying his bills 
 i wonder if your fiancé is still angry about it or if he was angry in that moment and has now worked through it it sounds like there was also a difference in expectations here 
 as a certified sex addiction therapistcandidate im convinced your partners acting out creates trauma for you  your partners addiction is not your fault and his recovery is his responsibility 
 one thing you need to ask yourself is am i happy? do i feel loved? these are deep questions but the answers to those questions will give you a direction to travel in  
 i want to encourage you that his actions may have little to do with you and regardless of outcomes i hope you find the help you need to process through your pain and still have hope for your marriage  if your husband was to work with me id explore with him his understanding of and experience with intimacy in relationship with others 
 have you tried asking him about it? sometimes starting with asking whether he would be open to having an important discussion can be a good beginning  if that starts well perhaps continuing with something like ive noticed that we havent been together intimately or whatever phrasing works for you as much lately 
 couples have to work to maintain the spark  find a moment to talk to your husband aboutyour concerns and suggest ways to rekindle your sexual life be open to listento his concerns and demands as well 
sex is after all a two person enterprise if he would like to talk about the way youre feeling great and wonderful 
 that doesnt necessarily mean that your partner will give everything that you ask for but this is one of the ways that he can learn more about what would help you through this and you can learn how you could support him since traditional medical treatment is not something he wants you may also consider using some openended questions not yes or no answers to talk about what youre feeling about both about his cancer and about your relationship 
 i am very sorry about this lifealtering situation that both you and your boyfriend are going through  to be sure this is a devastating and lonely road for both of you 
 if youre aware of the reasons why you are jealous i dont know if they relate to this relationship or a previous one but you could remind yourself of the differences if your feelings of jealousy relate to something from your past also it may be beneficial to have a conversation with your childs father if you are both open to having a discussion about this in a way that you summarize what each other is saying so you are sure that you are understanding each other at least to some degree 
 is he open to having a discussion about this so you can ask questions such as that one?its possible that he does not understand the degree to which it hurts you try asking if there is a time that would be good to have a discussion that is important 
 i am very sorry that you are experiencing this  to be honest this kind of behavior is really emotionally abusive and you likely know that already 
 it may also be helpful to ask if you could talk for two or three minutes to make a point and then have space for her to talk for the same amount of time  you can adjust the timing for what works for both of you 
 if you are saying that you are not attracted to your girlfriend you could try changing what you do during sexual intimacy  you could also try slowly using nonsexual touch and discussing what you each like and would prefer to do more of compared to what is not as desirable 
five years is long enough to know that the way you feel toward your partner is more than likely going to remain this way talk with your gf about your feelings because she may not wish to be in a relationship in which her partner is not sexually attracted to her 
 this can often change the way that we look at different situations  try to look at what feelings for you when you notice that someone is checking her out and perhaps when you have felt these feelings before 
 and entertaining a tough is only going to make it a stronger target  careful with that friendship! you do not want to fill your marriages void with another person 
 i suggest to talk to him about how you feel let him know that although he is gone for a long time his presence as a husband and father are required and important  ask him if he will be willing to engage again and how he would like to do so 
 it sounds like you may benefit from personal counseling to explore where this jealousy comes from and what keeps you from having complete trust in your boyfriend  this is not stupid this is your mind telling you that there is something that needs to be worked through 
 youre only two months in? at this early stage this is a bit of a warning sign  if he cant accept or feel comfortable with who you are and decisions youve made theres already a level of discomfort here that shouldnt be ignored 
what you can do is explain how pressured you feel by his questions ideally the two of you will become much closer by talking openly about your respective discomforts and wishes from the other 
 your husband tells you that hes not in love with you but oops hes changed his mind and will tolerate you for a while longer? excuse me? my dear its okay if you expect more than that from a marriage  maybe the question has shifted from whether he is happy in the marriage to whether you are happy in the marriage 
 fear is telling you that she doesnt respect or like or want you? look at the bigger picture  what is the evidence that your wife wants to please you?

 the question aboutwhether or not to cheat is based on personal values that can only be answeredby you  however here are a few things to consider and questions to askyourself to help you find your answer1 
 almost everyone has the same fears you do to some degree especially if they lack experience  men also feel far more of these fears than you realize 
no one is a fantasy we are all real and unique  we can be influenced to believe that being a fantasy is better than being who each of us is genuinely 
 this is something that you should feel comfortable in talking with your partner about  the relationship needs to be strong before moving to the bed anyways 
 some people feel tremendously guilty when they cheat and others not at all  it could be that your partner doesnt know about the cheating and you havent had to face hisher emotions and reactions 
do you feel a commitment to your partner?your guilt probably is pointing out the feeling of having done with your body what your spirit tells you is a violation of the commitment you feel toward your partner the good news is that this is a moment for you to examine how strong your commitment is to your partner 
 dont allow their problems to become your problem  you didnt mention that your partner in your present relationship have done anything to make you not trust them 
 when youre in a relationship you assume that you will continue to receive warmth and affection  when it dries up its a very lonely place 
 most of the time this is simply because weve pulled back from all the attachmentforming behaviours we did at the beginning  we stop talking a lot because we have less to discover 
and these features are eating away at your selfconfidence start by believing in yourself 
 your boyfriends behaviours are about him not you  at the start of a relationship its easy to be loving and attentive but it takes years to really get to know someone deeply 
 theres a great book the five love languages by gary chapman  he explains that there are five main ways to give and receive love but we dont necessarily all speak the same love language as our partner 
 it can be scary frustrating and lonely  have you tried talking to him about your concerns? i would suggest to start there 
have you brought up any of these topics for discussion with your fiancé?now is a good time for finding out if and how your future husband is interested and addresses the way you are feeling until the two of you open up what bothers you all you or anyone who talks to you about the situation can do is take guesses as to what is driving your finances behaviors 
he has no time for me  
 i understand how lonely you must feel not only sexually but emotionally too from what you describe it seems that he wants tobe there for you but he clearly has barriers to engaging fully around this issue 
 how do you trust after you know someone is capable of hurting you? i totally get that its hard and i believe its worth it if you truly love and want to be with someone  you can be stronger in the scarred places 
 you may be feeling very close to this friend and mistake that feeling for sexual feeling or the feelings may be real  this is something you will find out for yourself however it definitely doesnt mean that you are a lesbian just because you have those feelings for this particular person 
 i have to say its a cruel thing to say to someone you love  
 lets figure this out  first has your partner given you any concrete reason not to trust them? have they cheated before? if not then they deserve the benefit of the doubt until there is evidence 
since you both are planning a long life together instead of his custom of ending relationships when he feels bored with the sex he will be facing the situation of being in a relationship and not having sex with his partner to whom he is committed what are your own views on the meaning of sex in a relationship?knowing this will help you be better able to collaborate with your boyfriend on finding ways of balancing what you each would like 
 differences in sexual desire between partners is common and can create real friction and conflict  i would encourage you to do some couples counselling or sex therapy as often these issues can be worked through and low sexual desire can result from relational fears and misunderstandings or sex that isnt as arousing as is possible 
from everything you describe about your wife she sounds to not yet have become comfortable with having a wish for sex the other side of the sex equation is you and your relative ease with having sex and whether it is for physical release or as an expression of love some of each

 there is new data that post part depression starts in the pregnancy before baby is delivered  there maybe those factors  
 id be curious about what it was like at the beginning for you both but these things can change  sometimes people with sexual barriers are very active for a period when theyre young because theyre trying to prove something or overcome a fear 
 there is obviously something that you are getting from this that you are not getting in your marriage  maybe this is a cue that there is work to do on your marriage to try to make it more fulfilling and if that is not possible then maybe you want something else for your life 
 will you have a list too? there are elements of control here humiliating you in front of coworkers saying you have to sign the contract before you can move forward  
do you and your boyfriend have an agreement on looking through each others phones?i ask because the overall problem sounds like lack of trust and that there may be a difference in what each of you wants and expects from your relationship probably if the two of you talk about these topics and you each become clear as to the commitment status of each of you to the other youll have more clarity as to what either of you would like from the other 
this dynamic itself creates problems of its own about your husband telling you he feels pushed out did he do anything on his own to address his problem of feeling like this?all you state is that he blames you for creating a situation he didnt like 
what was the context of your boyfriend adopting a cat since he was aware that this would likely cause problems in the relationship with you?if you dont already know his answer then find out  doing so will tell you a lot about your boyfriends expectations about you 
 i get how upsetting this is if i was your therapist id want to explore this a good deal because there are several possibilities concerning what might be happening 
is it possible that at this time period in your life being alone is positive for sorting through your true values or sorting through key situations in your life?if yes then possibly you are giving yourself some alone time even though to some degree being alone is not your first choice at the very least since you arent happy with being the one who texts others then some alone time may encourage new thoughts and ideas creating more open space within you to attract other people who do enjoy texting you first 
? if you feel pressured into being sexually active by your friends or boyfriend it is understandable that you want it to be over  i would encourage you to ask your boyfriend to be patient with you at this time until you figure out what is going on 
if no then possibly one reason for hating sex is that your boyfriend doesnt notice who you are as a person not simply a physical body engaged in sex  
 being unable to trust your significant other certainly can cause one to feel unsettled  has your spouse ever done anything questionable that would cause you to not trust her? if so then it will take time and some work to gain the trust back 
these type of discussions are hard to have and especially for the first time  a lot of emotions arise and often people lose their conversation focus from this 
 i also would bet that there are things that your wife would like from you this is a very common issue two people with different sexual drives or needs 
 i have biases that are about respect and every individuals need for and right to respect  your husband lies cheats and physically hurts you 
 you dont mention ever having hurt the trust in the relationship trust is the first stage in a relationship 
also there are many ways of making love  if your bfs cyst hasnt yet healed then another way of both increasing your emotional intimacy and learning different love making suggestions is to read about these together with him 
 the truth is that some people cheat and some dont and our partners deserve the benefit of the doubt unless they show signs they cant be trusted the answer here is in two different areas 
 he might feel like hes carrying his family on his shoulders  your love language is different 
are you and your husband able to talk about any or all of what youve written here?his answers would be a starting point for knowing how he understands his share of your relationship and whether and how he would like making any changes if the two of you feel too much tension in the relationship to bring up any of the topics you write about here then ask yourself the reason for this 
 not actions  it is your choice whether you act on these thoughts 
 if all physical possibilities are ruled out then its time to look within and enlist the help of a sex therapist  heres a good article for you to start with 
 it takes a lot for a man to reach out for help when it comes to erection problems  believe it or not this problem is very common for men and women 
 what if you take the focus hint pressure off of her orgasms and focus instead on connecting with one another  you know like the gestures you each likely made while dating 
 your sexual lives will ebb and flow  what id be more curious about is the quality rather than the quantity of the sex you are having 
 its a relatively modern dilemma you are facing with perhaps unrealistic expectations of what marriage should be  it sounds like your definitions of love and sexual passion have merged together thats both common and confusing! intimacy and sexuality within your marriage are bound to ebb and flow 
 i do understand that this is something that is bothering you though the first thing to ask yourself is if this is something that is illegal or not 
one thing i wonder is did you volunteer the information about your past or is this something that he asked about? in the future it is probably best to leave details out of conversations like this  i think it is common and natural for partners to ask about the sexual history 
 my heart goes out to you during this time first of all it is of vital importance that you discuss your symptoms with your doctor 
 if you feel like things situations your outlook are shifting for you  
 i understand the difficulty of needing help and not having financial resources  in some areas you can dial 211 and find resources in the area that may be free of cost or low cost

 he must have been very special to you and it definitely makes sense that you are having a hard time with it counseling may be an option if you have a university near you with a graduate marriage and family therapist program 
 some things that may help you through this tough time are to journal or write about special memories you have of your grandpa  you could also journal about your feelings of loss and how you miss him

 the sadness and crying is normal when you are missing a loved one  you are noticing that grief changes it doesnt just stop 
the academic point that grief takes a different length of time to lift for each person is true also from a spiritual perspective your grandma and brother are still here in loving relation to you just not in physical body 
 losing someone you love is always difficult however losing a mother is a significant loss in a daughters life  what makes this loss complicated is that it appears you have also had a loss in your relationship with your sister 
 death and grief bring up so many painful reminders of relationshipswhat they could have been never were and what was lost  with death of a family member the family often falls apart for a while 
the good news is you know how happiness feels that you were able to create situations and dynamics which produced happiness in your life is good motivation to believe happiness is possible and to try new ways to create this in your life 
 do you see it? i feel guilty about my fathers death and i spent my whole life taking care of my dad  wow 
 death of a child always leaves a permanent reminder to the parents of a very painful time in their lives the good news is your awareness that you and your wife are not connected in a satisfying way 
 grief is something that can take a long time to recover from  have you considered speaking with a grief counselor? being able to speak with someone that specializes in grief would be very beneficial 
 that is a really hard thing for someone to go through there is really no set time for grief to be over but i agree that if it has been three years and you are still crying every day then this is past the time for normal grief 
 it sounds like youre concerned about what happens when you drink too much and i suspect you already know the answer to your question about whether you have a problem or not  i imagine you would like to stop feeling guilty and would like to avoid cheating on your boyfriend or other negative consequences and maybe have a fear of being or becoming an addict or alcoholic 
 what you could do is visit this website by the national institutes of healthhttprethinkingdrinking niaaa 
 i would say the first question you should ask yourself is why you are drinking? the second would be why you feel the need to drink in excess? it may be due to a life event or the crowd you are running with  either way a therapist will be able to help you through this as you already made the first step in admitting you are having a difficult time 
 some possibilities are feeling unhappy in the relationship to your boyfriend not having enough discussion between the two of you not feeling cared about by your boyfriend not liking your boyfriend did you grow up in a family in which the grownups drank to the point of excess at the times they felt stressed?family modeling of how to handle problems may have left you no knowing how to handle stress except to drink to excess 
something like this alcoholism is a whole family disease  in other words family members often unknowingly contribute to the alcoholism and enable the alcoholic to continue the destructive behavior 
 often times individuals will be forced to stop when they were not ready  remember we can not ever make someone do something they do not want to do 
 good for you in planning ahead to do whats healthiest for your baby and yourself  thats a great first step! its also good that you are able to identify that its not always a physical need thats driving the addiction 
 the next thing i want to share is that there are so many different ways to kick the habit  some people find solace in groups while others prefer to see a counselor about this individually 
 and certainly planning to have a baby can be exactly the catalyst that one needs to motivate to complete this sort of task  but as i said it still wont be easy even with the motivation there 
 the mental aspect of quitting a drug can and usually is the hardest part  first it can be helpful to change the focus of your thinking so you are focusing on the healthy behaviors you will startimprove rather than only focusing on the behavior that you are trying to stop 
  cutting down or cutting out cigarettes is very challenging and there arent any one size fits all solutions  fortunately there are a lot of tricks and tools that you can use to stop smoking 
1  for a week  log when you smoke  time place and activity2 
thinking about smoking is a typical and frequent reaction to being without the substance be creative with what you know about yourself to distract you when this psychological urge comes up 
 its also true that there is part that is sometimes a physical need and a part that is often connected to emotions in some way  from the way that you wrote this it sounds like you may have been able to stop smoking physically but still have cravings 
 we often crave the things more that we know we can not or should not have  with that being said i would encourage you to become aware of the chemical dependency part that cigarettes have on your brain and your body 
 i would recommend that you speak with someone abut your relationship and your concerns  not only so you can have more clarity in the situation but we often tend to gravitate around or toward the same types of individuals 
 if not no matter how many pills you take they will find a way to get more  it is also a federal offense to take someone elses medication so if you did take it she could have you arrested

 i have a worked with many people who have become addicted to benzodiazepines like clonazepam  it is a difficult road for people who are trying to become clean 
 usually there are other signs of use that can often be missed  be aware of behavior changes and mood swings 
 it can be challenging living in a household with someone who is currently addicted  it is also important that you realize that you can only work on yourself

 i know it can be really difficult to deal with issues like this to answer your question you might be able to get you brother some mental health help even if he doesnt recognize that he needs it 
since the description you write here is that your brother may be a serious risk to himself and others it is worth contacting a mental health hotline or one of your local area hospitals and talk to a social worker or other professional level person in their psychiatry department  ask the same question you posted here 
in new york you cant institutionalize someone else directly  you can however call the police or ems 
 if you had this you could do something like that  im assuming that you dont though 
 im hearing your hopelessness and fear about the damage of your substance use and it sounds like you have reason for concern  while there can be negative stigma about using substances for the most part substance use is an attempt to cope with emotional distress in the absence of sufficient coping strategies 
 addictions of any sort are difficult to overcome especially when they serve to bury pain and suffering that one is experiencing  it is not impossible to overcome alcohol or drug useabusedependence on your own but you will likely find much greater success with the help of a therapist or other support system such as rehabilitation or alcoholics anonymous 
 how to stop abusing alcohol involves a few steps most of them time consuming with slow progress and very often with tremendous emotional pain the basic path is to figure out what motivates you to drink too much and be addicted to weed 
 it is hard to to be told over and over again how not good enough we are  let me offer you this frequently when we say harsh mean nasty things to others we are simply projecting our own thoughts about ourself 
 frequently our problems keep us in denial  although feeling hopeless is an uncomfortable feeling it suggests to me that you know that you can not do this alone 
 i would suggest that you first get evaluated for your alcohol consumption  alcohol is one of the addictions that you may need to seek inpatient treatment for

 your mom means a lot to you and that is why you get easily frustrated  im guessing that it is not that she is making you do work or that her expectations are nonimportant to you because if that were the case you would not feel any guilt

 however you also need to make sure that you have time away from her so that the stress of caring for her doesnt overwhelm you  balance is the key! 
 it is not your moms fault  always remember that in spite of the disease that human being you call mom is still there 
 your mothers behavior as you describe it is a part of this disease  as the disease progresses and she is less aware of the present including her surroundings and who she is speaking to 
 then say that word to yourself as you take deep breaths  but know that this is normal for caregiversfamily members to have these reactions because it is also an emotional roller coaster for you 
 yes this is a symptom of an ugly disease but that does not make experiencing it any easier  if your mother was a sweet and understanding lady i am sure this change in personality feels awful! on the other hand if your relationship with her has always been difficult this can definitely open up old wounds and anger 
 in this stage of alzheimers individuals tend to be blaming and difficult to deal with  they may often hide or throw things away and then blame family members for this 
feeling a sense of guilt in relation to a parent is pretty common for everyone this is because as little kids and babies we had a strong reliance on a parent and believing every word they sad and wishing to follow each action they ask or demand was for the benefit of our own survival 
has your mom usually ignored your opinions and wishes in relating to you?if prior to the onset of alzheimers she never examined her way of relating to you and if both of you have never had an open conversation about your sense of feeling hurt by her attitudes and manner with you then the relationship between you and your mom will change in ways other than rational dialogue she may continue ignoring or overlooking your wishes because shes been stuck in this attitude for most of your life 
expressing positive emotions to her i e 
in fact it is not okay for one person to be the authority for another person unless the one for whom this is being done does not have their own ability to think for themselves separating your own wishes and way of handling life matters from your mothers point of view may be difficult 
 having someone whos outside the situation and even more so with knowledge and experience in human behavior and relationship dynamics such as a counselor can do wonders in helping us feel less alone in frustrating situations like the one youre currently stuck in with your mother  a professional can also assist you in finding some assertiveness techniques communication strategies and coping skills to help you find your voice and stand your ground in a way that feels most authentic to you 
based on what you describe about your relationship to the woman in question your discomfort with the idea of your dad marrying your friend is reasonable have the conversation with your dad that includes your viewpoint and also ask him for his impression of your feelings 
 this person moving from a friend of yours to both a friend of yours and in a sense your step mom is a lot  i wonder if you have let your dad know whats going through your mind with this and how it is affecting you 
 you cannot change your mothers feelings and responsibilities which could create feelings of frustration and helplessness  it must be equally hard for your mother to assume full responsibility for your niece at a time where your sister cannot take care of her 
the truth exists whether or not it is acknowledged   bu acknowledging what feels real and necessary in your life you are helping your mom see what she may not like to see and what nevertheless is right in front of her 
you mentioned that you want to learn how to avoid them  im not sure whether you want to avoid them overall or if you would like to ask your mom to maybe only talk to you about it for a few minutes about your niece in each conversation that you have 
 she has returned to parenting after she thought she had raised her kids and while i am sure youd like to be supportive you recognize that listening to her complaints really does not help her and drains you  in addition to that it sounds like moms complaining has become the conversation she has with you leaving other more fulfilling conversations out of your relationship 
 i would encourage you to identify how it makes you feel after talking with your mother  work on establishing healthy boundaries where you do not feel obligated to engage the complaining daily 
 read it  apply it 
 boundaries are important in relationships  they are invisible lines that we will or will not cross 
 perhaps having a conversation with your mother about making the communication more productive in nature  it seems like your mother is obviously having some difficulties and she is stuck therefore making you stuck listening to complaints on repeat 
 therapy can help you to define establish and enforce boundaries between self and others by being assertive  this involves determining what things make you uncomfortable and how to communicate that with assertive not passive not aggressive actions and language 
 i encourage people to validate the other persons feelings by saying i am sorry you are going through this  then to set the boundary bye stating what you need from them or what you are trying to do with your life to destress and that you cant be a listening ear right now 
 you can do this by letting her know that you understand how she is feeling and you understand that she is under a tremendous amount of stress  validate her feelings and words 
 setting boundaries is important to maintaining a peace of mind  if you have not communicated your feelings to your family member that would be a good first step 
 who exactly is complaining? 
 i am very sorry that this was your experience with your family  i truly wish icould give you some things to say to them that would change their reaction but unfortunately i cant do that 
 if your family is not supportive of you this can be a huge challenge  are you dependent on them in some way financially etc 
 it is truly heartbreaking to hear  the important thing to remember is that your identity as bisexual is valid and you are worthy of love no matter what other people say 
 this can be hard for a family to hear for several reasons but you should be proud that you had the courage to tell them  once they realize how brave you were and how much you need their support they will come around 
 family hearing news of any kind for the first time if they are an anxious type of character will always be tough to digest  time is important to let it all settle in and also making sure youre taking good care of yourself 
here are a couple of things to do right nowpractice giving yourself some love  bring your awareness to the room around you and some of the positive energy within you 
maybe eventually they will come around to greater acceptance of you   if this was the first time they heard this fact about your sexuality the information may have overwhelmed them 
 it is hard to know which way might be advisable if we dont know quite why they would yell or why would they care who you choose to sleep andor partner with to begin with?however it is of utmost important that you accept yourself as bisexual and sometimes that is easier said than done  but when you are able to get to that acceptance that you are not in the majority in society as far as sexual orientation goes and all that comes with that and perhaps other issues you might have with it it will be significantly easier for you to tolerate your familys lack of acceptance and perhaps chalk it up to a severe lack of openmindedness 
it is possible the two of you have very different opinions on a great number of matters each person including you has the right to decide whether and how to respond to someone 
obviously if your family doesnt accept your questioning status then this feels painful all you really can do is continue your selfexamination and know youre in a nonsupportive family of doing so 
maybe you could talk about your concerns with your significant other and discuss different ways you may be able to discuss your relationship that fit with how each of you defines your love for one another because you are saying openly that you are gay and it sounds like you already identify yourself as gay as compared to considering being transgender soon it may be worth considering disclosing the fact that you are gay now and disclosing the idea that you are transgender after you have worked through that yourself 
if there already is strong animosity mistrust dislike between both of you then there is more chance he will not seriously consider your advice for your own peace of mind say whatever you feel must be said to him 
i wonder if you could talk with your brother about whether he would be willing to have a discussion with you about something that is important to you  i would also suggest trying to make clear your true intentions 
unless you are lying to yourself or to them then your best effort deserves appreciation and support from family the family members may have reasons besides the actual outcome of your school work to be so blind to your investment of effort 
where does your family get the idea that you are not putting in the effort? while people can interpret effort differently with talking about schoolwork i would think that your grades would show the effort that you are putting in if you are getting good grades and you are saying that your family does not think your grades are good enough maybe there could be a conversation where you are able to ask them what they are expecting from you and try to listen without defending yourself for a few minutes and then you could explain what you are doing to prepare 
im very sorry your mom has such negative views on you please know that there must be some reason in her personal history or relationship life which drives her to criticize you so strongly 
it sounds like there are things for which you are proud of yourself which is really good  i hope there are also other people in your life that are currently able to recognize the good things that youre doing 
 as a teenager you may be able to get counseling on your own without needing your parents consent under some circumstances  if your parents are refusing toconsider counseling you might want to try talking to your doctor or another trusted adultabout finding some counseling resources  even without your parents help 
 can i get my family into therapy? how can i get someone else to do something that i think is best for them? the answer is you can suggest but you can’t force them  i spend a lot of time teaching my patients the importance of recognizing the difference between the things that we can change and the things or people that we cannot 
the fact that she is your mother and is not supportive and willing to point out your strengths is a good reason to not believe what she tells you parents are meant to nurture their children not take them down with words 
start by telling your boyfriend to keep his remarks about you and the interests he is in which you two disagree limited to these areas your relationship with your mother is between you and her 
 im not sure whether talking with her on the phone or through some videoconferencing application such as skype would be something you could do in the meantime until you sort out what you want to do some things i wonder arewhat makes the two of them not get along?what makes him feel threatened or on edge if you visit your mother without him? what does he think will happen?what is he getting out of trying to choose for you?what is he so afraid of?if you decide to talk about these things with your boyfriend try to do the followingconsider using questions that start with the words who what where when and not why 
 there is nothing wrong with you for not liking your sister  some people are fortunate to have siblings that they get along with really well other dont 
 my guess is theres a lot of deep history here that i dont know about  have you felt hurt by your sister in the past or are you just different people? its a common feeling people have about siblings that theyre very different and they wouldnt choose them as friends but most people stay connected to family unless theres a good reason not to 
  its fine to not love your sister you may make some discoveries about yourself and your relationship with your sister by studying the reasons for why youre not close 
from what you write it sounds like your wife and you have differences as to what is the proper and right way to talk with your mother once the both of you agree on overall philosophy and some specific details for examples then ask your mother to make time for all three of you to discuss together the expectations and standards you and your wife would like to see happen 
 you have been triangulated by your wife and mother this is often seen in families 
since you are in a relationship with this guy your emotions keep your feelings active toward him does he respect your upset with his lifestyle choices?are the two of you having conversations about your opinions on him?youre as entitled to dislike what he does as he is to like what he does 
from what you write your family members do not offer you your very reasonable expectation start by telling particular family members with whom you feel youd have the most likely chance of success in their meeting your expectation by loving you 
 you will have a neutral person that can listen to both sides and help you all find a common ground of understanding  if she doesnt agree to counseling really the only person you can change is you 
since the father is his your boyfriend is the person in position to speak directly with his dad about the expectations you and he have of the father if your boyfriend has a good relationship w his dad which is not what this sounds like then great!if your boyfriend has a stressed and tense relationship w his dad then somehow he needs to develop or be coached and encouraged by the people in his life who truly care about and know him a way to state the very reasonable standards you describe here 
once the two of you understand what if any the differences are in the opinions you each have on the double relationship status youll be more clear whether the differences can be aligned somehow  
it certainly is irritating and annoying to be yelled at for being yourself maybe at a time when hes not yelling you can bring up the topic of your own willingness if this is true to discuss questions he has about your gender 
you were betrayed by two people close to you  thats a complex injury 
 facebook is watered down candied version of our life you put on there only what you want people to see  the questions you should ask is how have i grown from this? is my marriage currently in a good place? i really wish there was some form of magic that could be performed to solve peoples issues and help them sort out their emotions and troubles however there is not the closest we can get is by using time and insight to heal our wounds 
concentrate on your own life and making your life the best it can be  
 you and your sister then you and your husband have a mediated safe talk 
 the power of the affair comes from the feeling of injustice that seems to have happened to you  the struggle i notice people have is with the forgiveness 
on the positive side think of how much you learned by going through this very painful time maybe you are naturally very generous and caring to the point of expecting very little from the other person for example 
 if the woman was your therapist or had been at one time this could represent a significant ethical violation when she created a dual relationship with you even if you were not her client this might still be an ethical violation 
if you are concerned about telling your dad regarding your gender identity i would suggest a couple of things  there are a lot of groups or other supports for people who are working through some of the same changes that you may be going through now 
 this is certainly a tough spot  i have a few thoughts and perhaps some colleagues will add some things 
 have you ever told her about how much she means to you when shes not angry? 
 do you think he would be open to an honest discussion? it could be that his comments about your outfit are designed to make you feel good or to help them show how much he cares about you as his stepdaughter  as far as scanning you from head to toe i can think of reasons that parents might do that 
 a lot of us have natural instincts that we do not want other people to be in pain  for other people conflict is just hard to watch andor listen to 
in the situation you describe both you and the family members who ask for your intervention will be affected by any change you decide to make in the way all of you handle family disagreements always it is best for any two people who have a disagreement to talk directly with each other 
something you may be able to do is call the area agency on aging for the county where you live and ask for information about having other people help to care for your mom  i dont know how old your mom is but if she is younger they would probably have resources to other ways that you could have help 
 even parents who live in different states can do that sometimes  its not as frequent as spending one week at one house and the next week and the other but i know that it happens 
 perhaps you could send him letters expressing your feelings and hopes  but do understand that if he is under the influence of drugs he might not be able to empathize with your feelings or react in the way that he would have done so in the past 
all the words you wrote represent psychological conditions which are either lifelong or take a lot of motivation and effort to change since the only person who can change how your mom handles her life is your mom and you are the only one who can do the same for yourself devote more energy and time to living your own life fully despite the emotions you feel regarding her 
 at times it seems difficult to communicate with our family because many feelings and “undercover” messages are attached  especially with our mothers who often provide advice and feel responsible for us it may feel like they are making everything about themselves as they express their worries and concerns 
 i really want to be able to talk to you  
 you have already figured out that other peoples behaviours  
 being bisexual can be particularlydifficult because it is often misunderstood even by people who are “supposed”to be part of your own community such as lesbians and gays  it happens sooften that there is actually a term for it –bierasure 
 however although i cannot promise what their reaction will be the benefit is that you will no longer have to hide who you are  perhaps researching or getting information on bisexuality can help your family understand what it truly is to be bisexual 
 often timesour readiness is not dependent on what others will say or how theyreact but more so dependent onhow emotionally prepared we are to deal with others reactions 
 this is one of those times when you wish you could assure someone that everything will go perfectly but unfortunatelyi cant do that  there is no way of knowing how parents might respond until you tell them 
 you grow up gradually and parents often forget to shift their habitual responses according to your newfound level of maturity and growing need for freedom and independance  im all for helping you find new ways to cope and interact with your mom 
 stressors come in many forms and you are engulfed in a few of the major ones as it relates to dealing with the declining health of your father family conflict as well as trying to balance a work and school schedule  stress if left unchecked has many negative health related implications 
 i can only imagine your hurt pain and confusion on what to do  honestly this is a hard question to answer without knowing your age your parents ability to handle hearing information from you and your maturity to handle what may happen in the end 
 its a dilemma you want your dad to know how hes hurting you but you dont feel safe enough to say anything to him  your reaction is understandable its his responsibility as a parent to work harder than you to create that safe place for you to be open 
also given the other facts you mention in your post if household and financial management are areas you feel your daughter is vulnerable then bring up these topics too stay open minded about your daughter having views which are different from yours 
i wonder what gets in the way of you celebrating your daughters pregnancy?are they excited about it? i bet they are  theyve been together for seven years 
 its possible that your aggression towards your friends is connected to your mothers behaviours  when we are treated poorly especially as children it affects how we ourselves others and the world 
these steps ideally allow a new door to open in order to develop new paths in the existing relationship or accept that this will not be possible due to either persons way of handling themselves the long answer would be that youre not yet through with this process 
 youre scared that if you forgive your mom that would mean it wasnt so bad or shell think its okay to do it again or she wont realize how hurt you are i invite you to look at forgiveness in a different way 
 one of the hardest things about this however is getting both people within the relationship to recognize that they are both responsible for the successes and failures within the relationship and remove all the allornothing blame the best style of communication is open and asking for clarification why not try asking your mother why this particular fightsituation is eliciting such an angry response 
 its so sweet that you have a special relationship with your brother  you will always have that you know? hes doing whats natural at his age 
 feeling sad over these losses are normal  while there may be some things you can do to remedy this situation it is important that you try and understand that part of life is change 
 its sad that youre feeling excluded at christmastime and family events  while i would suggest that you dont really know what he or his family are thinking or feeling you assume theyre against you and that he doesnt care he is certainly behaving in a very distant excluding manner and its understandable that you would feel rejected and hurt 
 if they don’t see these qualities in you then it may be your cousin’s issue and she’s taking it out on you  you can always ask her what would be the best way to communicate plans with her so you know specifically what she is expecting 
 it also sounds like you would like to see if you can find a new way to relate to your cousin so that your relationship can be more satisfying  if you can find a competent therapist to work with there may be a great deal of opportunity to learn more about how you relate to people in the world and to learn strategies to show up in your relationship with your cousin in a way that feels right to you 
 have you had a discussion with your mom as to why she does not want you and this boy to see each other and what her concerns are? it sounds as though you and your mom may be able to use some help with communicating and compromising  it is understandable that you do not to feel comfortable having to lie to your mom 
 i always say that a little bit of guilt is healthy because it teaches us who we want to be  listen to that voice 
are you and your parents able to talk together about their reason for their standard?are your parents willing to listen to your reasons to not play on the team you hate?if yes then maybe some type of compromise is possible for all of you to negotiate if none of the above is possible then you may want to get specific and direct advice from a professional such as the school guidance counselor or psychologist whom youd trust and feel safe in talking 
 regardless of whether or not you are sensitive it is okay to want better communication with those who are important to you  when we feel that we are being talked down to or being ridiculed it is difficult to not take it personally 
 i appreciate your mature instincts and strong efforts to draw clear boundaries in this very complex situation  i agree that it sounds like the adult drama is unnecessary and potentially will affect the children 
 it may be precisely because your brothers demand so much more your moms attention through fighting with her that she pays more attention to them  it is a common situation in families where the squeaky wheel gets the grease and the siblings or family members who dont demand as much attention end up feeling invisible 
 since they are adults and you cant force them to seek treatment you might be able to suggest that there could be an underlying medical issue and advise they speak with a medical provider   
 your relationship is repairable but you may need some qualified support in the process  
 trust is a huge thing in relationships and when that is broken or perceived as being broken it takes a long time to repair  from what you shared it sounds like your boyfriend took steps to correct the situation and has shown to be trustworthy since 
 its called the childhelp national child abuse hotline  the number is 18004achild 18004224453 
 i do not know what all is going on in your family and i cannot answer for your dad’s actions or his reasoning behind this i would recommend that you focus on developing healthy coping skills 
 there are several things to consider before you make a decision  you mentioned that you dont want your wife and mom to know because you dont want to hurt them – why would it hurt them? is it necessary for them to know this information? what are the consequences of either telling them the truth or not telling them? for you and for your wife and mom 
in both temporary or longer term arguing ask yourself if the points being argued are core principles of yours or matters which you can accept in service to the benefits you feel from the marriage if your core principles are rejected you’ve been arguing for an extended amount of time and the value of the marriage doesn’t outweigh this then seriously consider if ending the relationship is a better option than to stay in it 
 in one sentence i would say the followingrecognize that while you and your partner probably have common interests and areas of commonality you are separate people each with different wants wishes and desires – if you consider a diagram of two overlapping circles they may share perhaps a third of the circle with overlap to indicate commonality could be more or less and then there are parts of the circles that are not overlapping indicating separate interestsas for ways that may strengthen any relationship even the great ones this is what came to mind  there are certainly more specific unique answers or elements for different people as far as the details but here are some general ideastry to have at least 15 minutes a week where you are spending time together and not problemsolvingrealize that listening to your partner does not mean that you are agreeing with them it just means that you are saying that you hear where they are coming fromlearn to hold on to your own wants wishes and desires while also recognizing those of your partnerset boundaries for what is and isnt acceptable behavior during an argument or difficult discussiondiscuss how having important discussions can be anxietyproducing and consider having an understanding that if one of you or both of you feels overwhelmed you can take a timeout for a certain amount of time 
 ups  downs doubts and fights are a part of it justthe same as the wonderful tender blissful moments of connection  recognizing that hardships are normal and something to work through is a big part of the healthy attitude partners in lasting relationships share 
 john gottmans book seven principles for making marriage work dr 
 a good marriage is one that takes hard work and commitment  being in a good marriage does not always mean good times because lets face it we are dealing with 2 unique individuals with differences 
 an unequal participation comes in many forms such as one person checking out of conversations when it becomes emotional or speaking over and for each other in these conversations  couple’s should strive for engagement and support but doing it in a way that works for each person individually 
the answer of what makes a good marriage are as varied as there are marriages basically similarity like mindedness in beliefs and values makes a good marriage 
 however i do believe their are some basic fundamental areas that are beneficial for a healthy marriage1  effective communication2 
 you need support right now and yes you need answers  she is in denial and is trying to hide the truth to protect herself 
 communication is essential between couples and often times gets neglected in relationships  working with your husband to help him become a better listener and consequently a better communicator is going to take some work from your part 
 this is a great question  communication is definitely a 2way street 
 but i would look at this as an opportunity to see if you can become aware of what exactly is happening between you when you try and talk with your husband sometimes it can be in the way dialogue is approached 
some partners prefer that one person is the rule maker or the only one who is entitled to talk about themselves if your husband tells you he wants to listen to you or even that he does listen to you then you can explain in detail the way you define listening which may be very different than his definition 
 however you can give him feedback on how his not listening impacts you  the best way to provide feedback is in 3 parts 
 there are many different house of things that may be helpful here  i can give you some general ideas but if some of these things dont get you to where you would like to go consider seeing a therapist who specializes in couplesremember that you can only guarantee change in yourself 
 he needs to understand that how you feel about this issue equates to not being as happy in the relationship as you could be or he thinks you are  so start there that may be more of an attention getter than you never listen to me yes i do etc 
 when couples are able to repair after an argument they have an opportunity to learn more about each others needs moving forward im also curious if youre having the same type of arguments over and over? if youre stuck in a particular pattern and can start recognizing what happens between you when this pattern happens then you can start to name it 
 this is a process of adaptation even if you had known your better half for a long time during the first months and years of marriage you go through a process of settling in your new roles and confront new challenges together that as you resolve become new rules and agreements yes you can work this issues by practicing assertive communication being clear with each other about what is the problem how you feel about it and how would you like to resolve it 
 your perceptions of interactions that you are having dont sound like they match up  it would probably be helpful for you both to work on communicating using i statements i feelwhen you 
 infidelity is an extremely challenging obstacle to overcome  there are some things that you should consider 
 like many of the professionals have stated infidelity is a very difficult obstacle to move forward from  its not impossible 
 id highly suggest going to couples therapy and addressing all the issues that danielle raised especially whether he has expressed genuine remorse and is being completely transparent with you and is taking responsibility for the choice he made including acknowledging the immense impact it had on you your relationship and your ability to trust him if you have doubts about being able to trust him he needs to be willing to earn back your trust and do whatever it takes to do so 
 youre entitled to your feelings all of them and you need to know that your husband understands you  that said some ways are more effective at rebuilding and repairing relationships that others 
 unless he has already told you so  i agree with the other poster who recommended you try and ask him more questions with an open and curious attitude and see if he might be open to explaining more with you 
with regard to what you said about your husband dressing as a female in your bedroom i wonder if you would consider asking him more about this  if you choose to do that i would suggest that you ask him whether a certain time is a good time to have a conversation and asking questions for five minutes or more that are related to you learning more about his experience 
 the challenge here is you cannot control another person no matter how hard you try  the only person that you have control of is yourself 
 loving someone whodoesn’t respect or treat you well can be enormously difficult and painful  many people who find themselves in an emotionally hurtfulrelationship say that it was wonderful when it first started but that overtime their partner’s behaviors changed and they became emotionally orphysically abusive 
 it could be that he is showing that he is getting mad at you because he is worried about you and it is just coming out wrong  maybe he would be open to an honest discussion? 
 obviously something has shifted which you do not understand  therefore perhaps you should consider attending couples therapy to help work through your concerns and feelings? it would also be beneficial to assess if in fact any depression or other underlying issue is going on 
 please try to find time for you to clarify your thoughts and feelings by writing talking to a trusted friend or family member and perhaps seeing a therapist whats really going on with your husband? does he discuss in detail his sudden change?can the two of you still talk? do you want the same things? before you go to couples counseling i suggest that you get some support first to feel grounded within yourself and your life 
 am i to assume that you cant afford a new one? ideally she buys you a new couch but it certainly would be a gesture of love for you to do it too and it will help you both move forward t will be interesting to see if theres anything else that keeps the problem alive after the couch is long gone 
 thousands of people are having this same feeling right now  im glad youre paying attention to it 
since you and your wife are in a relationship the sex she will have with another man will affect emotions in both you and your wife i suggest you and her prepare emotionally before you both go ahead with the sexual arrangementby anticipating any jealousy or feeling helpless or out of control or in control since its your wish being fulfilled all the feelings you and her are able to expect youll be more prepared for the actual emotions from the episode which may also resolve your conflicted feelings about creating the event 
 with appropriate professional support for your relationship a lot is possible  im not familiar with the resources available in jackson but im sure there are some good local couple therapists and there may be some agencies that specialize in couple counselling and family therapy 
when the immediate situation has calmed down have you ever told him that this upsets you? is it possible he simply is not aware that you feel upset by how he talks to you?keep in mind too that what you believe your husband must change may not agree with his opinion on what he needs to change a helpful starting place for the two of you to discuss once the immediate situation has calmed down is what you each feel would have been a reasonable way of handling the situation that just happened 
 if you are feeling like you need to walk on eggshells or that you cant speak your mind and say how you feel then that sounds like a problem  i would recommend having an open discussion with your husband about communication between the two of you in general 
 trust as you clearly know is essential to healthy relationships  past indiscretions or dishonesty can damage this trust and make it really hard to confidence that these things will not happen again despite reassurances 
the typical therapy formula for restoring trust between two people after some sort of betrayal is for the one who has broken the trust to earn it back restoring trust requires both persons to actively involve themselves in this process 
 if the lack of trust on your husbands end has to do with something you did in the past then be patient and give it time  once trust is broken it takes time and effort to gain it back 
 his reactions may not mean that he doesnt trust you but rather that he gets scared that hes going to be hurt again youre a bit vague about the past 
 with that being said  relationships and mental health are very complicated and you are unlikely to find the answers you are looking for  in order for someone to be diagnosed with a mental illness or in order for them to identify what leads them to fall into particular patterns in relationship  they would need to be willing to seek help and honestly talk about their challenges something that you say your ex is not willing to do 
 betrayal is very hard to get over so if its taking you awhile to get over know that this is normal hopefully youre husband has been very regretful and upfront and honest with you since this happened 
 this was something that you and most women think about for years so its understandable to be disappointed  but please be aware that it is rare that any wedding is perfect 
 it is called open path collective  there is a one time membership fee of 49 and it lasts for your lifetime 
 many of them provide treatment on a sliding scale fee  i would google online mental health treatment providers and that should lead you to a list of providers that can help you 
 additionally churches will often timesoffer counseling for free or for a small fee  i suggest doing a simple google search and contact therapists in your area 
if you have a style youre already happy with to reflect on these sorts of topics keep following your own logic with the aim to free yourself which usually takes place gradually from these sort of selfdoubts the other approach would be to find an unperson or an online discussion group where youd be able to offer and receive the support from other people who live with a similar problem 
 this means that typically after you binge you experience emotions as you described shame and disappointment and then because of these emotions you repent i e 
 it is more common than you might think and tied to so many variables that it is easy for an individual to become overwhelmed in trying to navigate the influences of such variables  i have been working with individuals dealing with such challenges since 1998 and have found over the years that behavioral analysis is highly effective in helping you begin to isolate understand and then be able to address many of these variable impacting your behavioral and cognitive choices 
 you can absolutely break the cycle but it takes a lot of effort  much like growing a physical muscle developing coping mechanisms must be practiced exercised in order to gain strength 
coping mechanisms are superficial instruction that people usually give up on when feeling extreme pressure from the problem behaviors take the slower road of understanding why you would deprive yourself of enjoying food 
 this is such a great question and im sure many others will relate to exactly what youre describing  there are a few different ways we can look at in understanding your concern 
 a simple walk around the block calling up a friend and going to visit or even going to another room in the house can help  if you find that you truly have no self control over food i recommend attending overeaters anonymous a 12 step group for those with compulsive issues related to food 
forming a relationship does bring up our values and the way these are different or similar to our own   at the same time we already have values which are rooted in those from the family in which we grew up 
possibly you consider the quality of your selflove as inferior to love someone else gives you the best way to push through to your own selfcomfort and acceptance is to be aware of this tendency so you can remind yourself to practice appreciating the unique love you give to yourself 
 the relationship sort of soothes this temporarily and the others interest or desire helps counteract the ingrained belief  there are many questions that may help understand why how was your relationship with your mother caregivers? how was your childhood etc 
 it sounds as if there is a part of you that is looking for support  i wonder what it is that you feel when youre not in a relationship?because of the way you asked the question im getting the impression that you are referring to romantic relationships 
 if you are asking i believe you trulycare for your boyfriend  it seems like he is having difficulties in establishing trust in this relationship 
 from here we can objectively decide if spending time with your previous partner because that is likely what your boyfriend sees them as is worth harming the relationship you currently have  it is very rare that a person would be comfortable with their partner spending more than a very little amount of time with their exes 
 was it objectively wrong to spend the weekend with a good friend who also happens to be an ex? probably not  but it upset your current boyfriend and he is entitled to his feelings if you are in a relationship with him 
 both people in a relationship bring their own expectations into it  these expectations are usually unspoken but result in conflict as you are experiencing here! your boyfriend expects you not to spend the weekend with this guy 
 there are a number of factors playing into this situation  a former romantic partner coming back onto the scene during a current relationship you spending alone time and spending the night with that former partner and the uneasy feelings experienced by your current partner boyfriend 
start w a discussion with your current boyfriend as to what specifically he doesnt like about your friendship with your former boyfriend it is possible that you can answer his concerns as well he can find out from you more as to what the friendship is all about 
 the boundaries of relationship include the rules to follow in the relationship  it is important to follow the rules of your relationship in regards to each person being able to spend time with exes 
 i think this type of situation can be common for many couples struggling with how to keep friendships with past relationships while being in a new relationship for me more information is needed here 
 you both need to discuss it and come up with a solution that works for the both of you  you want to spend time with your friend but your boyfriend may feel betrayed by you spending quality time with another man you have been intimate with 
 when you cross over from friends to a relationship it does change things  some people are very easy going and wouldnt feel threatened by what you did others would be upset 
youre not overreacting and instead are genuinely sensing that something feels unsettled within your girlfriend you are overreacting because you have difficulty accepting how safe and loving your relationship is with this person 
 thats an excellent first step because without recognizing these things about yourself its unlikely that you would change that said you sound as if you are really ready to start some therapy to work on your own personal growth 
 on one hand most of us would say we want our partners to always be honest with us but on the other disclosures like this can lead to feelings of worry and inadequacy if were not careful  so let me first of all say that it is very normal for human beings even very committed and happy partners to have moments where they notice an attraction for someone else 
 you do not want to appear to jealous and yet its hard not to be when you hear about the crush  its only natural to feel a little insecure and youre doing a great job by asking how to cope better 
 even if you have spectacular communication while in a longdistance relationship it is difficult to maintain intimacy because you are lacking in the physical contact aspect of intimacy  here we are not talking about sex but about the emotional connection that happens along with physical contact 
 several things come to mindi dont know how you are communicating but there is a great deal of difference between communicating through videoconferencing compared to text message when discussing subjects like this  being able to hear andor see each other will help you to be able to gauge a lot of the emotions connected to what is going on 
 when faced with our significant other telling us about a “crush” it can create or highlight feelings or thoughts that can promote feelings of insecurity  talk to your partner about their crush and use the conversation to strengthen your bond 
 but you should absolutely give your girlfriend the respect of believing both of those statements she gives you development of feelings and it being a crush  if that makes you feel a certain way mistrustful? no difference in feelings then that is what is most important to understand 
 it sounds like you and your girlfriend overcame the initial challenges considering that you’ve been together for over a year and she was honest in telling you about her crush  these are some clear strengths in your relationship 
since any longlasting relationship in which both people thrive means each partner freely speaks their mind and will be listened and responded then your current situation is a good one to start these foundations of talking with one another tell your girlfriend whatever is on your mind regarding her crush 
 it sounds like you are both having difficulty with the distance and i can only imagine that you have both been coping with this distance as well as you can  there are a few scenarios that i think would have pretty radically different paths for your own mental health and i would like to explore them separately 
 is that ok with you? and if it is what does it cost you? he says hes done but still wants the connection  that seems to leave him free to explore other options but it doesnt allow you to do the same 
to start the discussion w your partner understand your own reasons for continuing the relationship given his stated disinterest in the relationship your mood is probably affected by this 
if you think your boyfriend would be open to having a discussion try asking him for a time when he is willing to have an important discussion  when that time matches with a time that is good for you try discussing the type of relationship that you each want to have and what you can start and stop doing to get there 
 to answer in detail would require having quite a bit more information about what relationship problems have occurred that woke you up to the fact that youre not listening as well as you could and that youre running the risk of losing her given that i dont have all that information ill offer one simple suggestion 
 first i want to say that it is great that you are are willing to admit that you share some responsibility in some of the relationship problems you are having  this isnt always easy to do but it sure is important if you want to see improvement 
 becoming a good listener is an essential piece in being a better communicator  being an effective communicator will almost always improve the quality of your relationships 
 it consists of 3 steps1  mirroring what she says without judging commenting refuting defending arguing or scoffingjust listening no matter the content and repeating it back wordforword 
 i would secondrobins suggestion of reading anything by gottmann  hes fantastic 
as far as learning how to listen try some of these stepsask whether a certain time is a good time for your girlfriend to have an important conversationif she has a subject that she would like to discuss consider listening to her as an investigative reporter and asking questions that help you to gain more understanding of her experience  these questions usually begin with words like who what where when 
 life is not out to get you just listen and work on how your reactive to people and sitations around you  c 
the easier way to fix a relationship is when both people are helped to recognize the ways the couple dynamic falls short of what each person would like couples therapy is exactly this 
 however if you focus your attention on her what shes saying what shes feeling instead of trying to make yourself heard and understood first thats often a good step  also work on building winwin agreements with her and follow through on them 
 seeking individual therapy will help you to cope with the mood changes that come with bipolar disorder will give you a space to vent your negative thoughts and will allow you to find the coping mechanism to address life and relational challenges  if your boyfriend is interested in attending couples therapy with you it will assist in identifying the problems in the relationship that pushed him to the breakup and will give both of you the tools to communicate and resolve conflicts 
what type of move would you like him to make?if you mean youd be happy to have sex with this guy and not a relationship then wait for as long as your patience allows to wait for him to change his mind that he does want a relationship doesnt have a very strong base on which to stand 
 im curious about your comment that you are not as attracted as you should be  what is your measuring stick is for what you are supposed to feel in terms of attraction in a relationship? do you want to be sexually intimate? do you enjoy having sex with him? are you satisfied with your sexual relationship when you are with him?the fact that there is lust for other more attractive men does not necessarily mean anything  there will always be attractive men and more attractive men than your partner and these attractive men will be even more appealing when you are in a longdistance relationship far from the arms of your partner 
 and since you are considering marriage for how long do you imagine yourself being satisfied living with and without certain qualities of your partner there is a hard wired dynamic between two people that defines the basic structure of the relationship 
 he might be an amazing person but theres something missing for you  im curious 
since a lot of time has gone by since you and this girl saw each other on a regular basis right now youve got no idea if youd feel the same way about her today as you did a few years ago the relationship does point out the priorities and values you hold for a potential partner 
 relationships are tough enough and im sure your partner being distant has been upsetting for you  you are confused and want to mend the relationship with him but are finding it so hard to do 
a relationship means two people who relate right?!  if only one person does all the work to change their approach what they expect what they offer the other then this becomes the new problem to solve if youve already done a significant amount of reflection and change in the way you relate to him then the next step may be to be patient as long as possible while he decides what to change about his part in the relationship toward you 
 this will give clarification to the situation as we need to remember that everyones perception can be different  remember that relationships take work and take communication 
since you already are on the best road possible for yourself since this resulted from your own introspection keep trusting your own self work as to what develops and at what pace your relationship attraction qualities grow  
  then go ahead and tell him if what he does bothers you  in the best of cases he doesnt realize how his actions affect you and he will change 
when a relationship ends the daily life structure changes significantly  a break up means adjusting to differences in everyday life not only that the person is no longer connected with us 
if no then definitely have a private and direct conversation with your friend about the fact youre attracted to the brother find out the reason your friend becomes angry to hear you like the brother 
id start by understanding more about why you feel unable to trust your bf does this have something to do with a bad encounter you had from previous relationships or with a sibling or parent?its also possible youre intuitively sensing you cant trust your bf bc hes not trustworthy 
keep in mind that the best the amount and the number of times you tell your boyfriend some information about you still means that whether or not he is willing to accept and rely on your information is in his hands only try to feel satisfied with your own effort to explain yourself 
also depending on exactly what you mean by becoming emotional feeling overwhelmed by feelings typically happens when people feel a lot of stress and pressure in their lives   loneliness contributes to feeling overwhelmed too 
there are other many reasonable options too maybe he doesnt know a lot about hair styles or didnt want to even think through the question carefully and also didnt want to tell you this directly 
have you told her about feeling slighted? start telling her about your feelings  how she responds to you will tell you a lot about where her heart is and maybe too some of the reasons she has been so involved w the friend 
also one way to lessen the tension before speaking to someone is to tell them you feel unsure on how best to express yourself  this way youve prepared them to be patient with whatever words you do state 
 expressingyourself is vulnerable and being vulnerable is hard  it takes courage and workto be vulnerable 
these are very good predictors that youll be successful in what youd like to change try the next time you realize youre depending on your bf instead of friends yourself to interrupt whatever typical action youd take 
 it sounds like its time to explore and develop your own interests and engage in some activities that excite and challenge you  if you have time it could be useful to begin a new activity or class cultivate friendships outside of your relationship with your boyfriend and begin to reflect and meditate on ways to enhance your own personal fulfillment 
 when you find that nobody is around do you feel alone? your never alone  once you take the journey to really understand who you are and unconditionally loving all that is you there will never be an alone moment 
 thank you for sharing your heart here  i want to start off by saying in kind of an ironic way your struggle is something many people go through i might say quite often 
 generally the lack of connection can occur when you dont feel heard understood or valued  these are common emotional needs that result in a good and secure emotional connection that reduces feelings of loneliness 
it is possible you are a more sensitive and aware person than the people whom you describe as listening and not really hearing you not everyone has the same capacity or willingness to pay careful attention to what is going on in life 
 sometimes the fear of being rejected by the other of being criticized or judged by the other person or that what you will say stirs anger in the other person if you are able to know what your particular reason is for not talking then maybe you and your partner can talk about what makes talking easy or hard 
 so while you still look like grown ups your actions and words are motivated by very early preverbal parts of both of you  in simple terms it is as if two infants somehow acquire the ability to say words but they are motivated by very basic early wounds that were created due to deficits in what was able to be done for each of you and likely understandable in terms of caregivers life experience and that still fell short of what you needed 
 both have to be willing to do their part to make communication work  this is something that takes both and not just one 
 a few questions id like to ask him is why he says he doesnt love you when the topic at hand is about a specific practical matter id also like to know what he hopes will happen from dwelling on a matter 
 one person working hard in a relationship can make things better for a while  but in the long haul you need two people giving some effort 
 the dynamics of having a romantic relationship with someone is not always clear  sometimes we jump from one relationship to another without giving ourselves a chance to adjust and grieve for the one we had to leave behind 
 the ability to listen considerately to your partner and to have your partner listen to you is one of the keystones of a successful relationship  if your partner is not listening to acknowledging and remembering your wishes that is likely an indicator of some fissures in the foundation of the relationship 
 do you typically spend most of your time together? if so it may be important to reflect on how you feel when you are apart  if any separation is difficult you may need to examine why 
 at least one of these groups will have some guidance as to social activities for dating or even specific sites for dating when autism is a criteria all the rejection on dating sites is rough for anyone to handle 
 these questions help couples to build connection and trust  its based on the idea that if you reach out to him for whatever reason support openess understanding empathy you can count on him and can expect him to be responsive 
 share with him that you looked at his phone as well as sharing with him any fears or concerns that youre having about the long distance relationship  trust is the foundation of any successful relationship and when doubt  distrust creep into a relationship it can undermine the long term health of the relationship 
 i would defintelylet him know you are asking out of concern and not to judge or criticize  allow him to explain his answer and see how you feel about it 
im not sure how you saw his phone if youre in a long distance relationship because long distance means you live far apart from each other and dont get to see each other in person  therefore i think we may have a different understanding of the definition of long distance relationship which makes it hard for me to adequately answer this question for you 
 youre definitely entitled to know if your wishes to not have him texting another woman are being respected often people are afraid to ask because they fear the truth will hurt them 
 you are asking a very good question about how to sustain a longdistance relationship  although maintaining a longdistance relationship has its challenges with the proper communication commitment and understanding many longdistance couples are able to thrive and maintain a close connection 
 my husband and i joined the usaf two months after we got married! how long do you expect to be apart? do you have access to skype or something similar? how far away from each other are you? can you meet half way periodically? i have a number of military friends who have dates over the miles with facebook live  they pick a restaurant order and talk about their day 
all you both can do is state your intentions and wishes keep in contact as much as possible and wait to see how your relationship unfolds to a large degree each of you is relying on faith that if the relationship is meant to last for a while then it will 
 if he loves you and you love him thats a great start  i wonder if you would be able or willing to have a discussion about what you love about each other and what makes each of you feel loved valued special and appreciated 
 and hollywood culture hasnt helped with romantic comedies and song lyrics telling us that when a man appears evasive theres something to worry about its been my clinical experience though that most women value transparency and security in their relationships 
have you blocked the unwelcome phone calls?has your girlfriend said she doesnt believe you or is this your interpretation?find out the answer and then ask your girlfriend to tell you her reasons behind her thoughts it is much easier to help someone understand a situation if the person is engaged in a conversation 
 your girlfriend may be suspicious if you dont give her enough information  answer her questions fully 
one of the terrible results of being abused in a relationship which is expected to be loving safe and supportive is that the one who is being abused starts to question their own judgement rights opinions overall way of thinking this happens because partners who are intimately involved with one another are very meaningful 
 i dont know how long you have been together  it is also common to want to be very closely connected to people who are important to you 
love deepens a sense of peacefulness and security obsessions give anxiety and worry of feeling abandoned 
 if you are at a place where you are willing or able to disclose the reason that you left your ex that could be one element of the discussion but it doesnt have to be i dont know how long we have been together with your current partner but perhaps his or her parents would see you for who you are and make their own opinions over time 
when you do everything right are you saying that you dont argue? it sounds a bit as though you are trying to read each others mind without being able to communicate effectively  i recommend working on this with a therapist though even if you end up going without your boyfriend to sessions so that you can talk about specific strategies and what you can do when he is not calm 
 maybe when youre in a relationship with someone you can discuss the amount of attention that you are both comfortable with andor what you are both looking for as far as amount of connection  
 you said that youve never felt this sort of feeling of your heart beating faster with your current boyfriend  depending on how long youve been together and if youre looking at different ways of making a life together and getting to know each other on a deeper level thats a different stage in a relationship and sometimes it feels different 
 can you have open conversations about your concerns? is he able to listen to that? im not sure how you know for sure that he lies and cheats but does he recognize these things as problems? which part of you is bigger the part of you that wants to stay or the part of you that wants to leave? can you consider what you want wish for and desire while also considering the same for him? can he do that for you? 
 sounds like you are stuck in a cycle of hearing your ex say you dont matter  thats why it didnt work with him btw 
 we learn how to be in relationship as children  the caregiving you received or didnt receive set the stage for how you show up in all your adult relationships 
one way of evaluating whether youre actually needy is whether you feel that you give yourself love take good care of yourself when youre in situations that are not connected to being part of a couple if being by yourself feels uneasy most of the time then probably practicing selflove consciously treating yourself with consideration and thoughtfulness may help you feel less needy of others 
 if the medications are not working and you have taken them as prescribed i would encourage you to seek the help of a sex therapist as the dysfunction may be due to a psychological andor relational issue rather than a physicalmedical one as for your question only you can answer this 
 i completely agree with dr  zehner 
 they are the only one who can tell you what it will take for them to trust you again  what they tell you may seem hard or impossible but unfortunately that is what they need 
what keeps you feeling connected to him in positive ways?if youre truly not happy most of the time in this relationship then youre at the time of asking why youd want to remain in a relationship which is draining  
 dont feel that the first second or even third relationship is the relationship you are suppose to be in for life  the one that is meant for you will require work but should be be draining and a constant roller coaster of breaking up 
 i worked for a number of years with people who have been both abused in their relationships and those who have been abusive  being involved in a relationship with a partnerwho does the behaviorsyou describe can be incredibly difficult and many would argue is even harder thanovercoming actual physical violence 
regardless of whether the response you receive is what youd hoped to hear including not hearing back from him you will have done yourself a great honor and respect by following through on a wish and curiosity youve had for some time  
 you never know where it will take you  you dont want to hold this regret of not letting your feelings known and wondering what if for the rest of your life 
 if you really want to be with him why not now? if you dont have time for a relationship why are you dating at all?i dont understand the whole phasing out thing that people do these days or ghosting where you just stop talking and disappear!  i get the sense that this relationship isnt working for you but for some reason youre stopping yourself from being honest with yourself and him and just ending it 
unless you have a whole either side to the way you feel everything you wrote here explains your position very well good luck in having your conversation! 
 obviously something is going on with him that he needs time to process think about and work through  respect that most men are not talkers but more thinkers 
people have different styles of reflecting on their lives one of which is to retreat the way you describe your boyfriend doing one point you can consider is asking for a time frame of when hed be ready to discuss his thoughts on your relationship 
 the first is what may have happened to prompt him to back off  the second is what it means to you to have a boyfriend who takes antidepression medication who says he has a lot on his mind 
 leaving is not the answer after a big argument as you mentioned  however this is not surprising to me based on his possible age and maturity level 
 i would suggest that first you get a full physical evaluation to make sure that you are ok physically  then getting a mental evaluation as well from a psychiatrist 
 your mom wants to protect you i get that  maybe she is worried youll be hurt again 
 you are in a vulnerable position because of social isolation  if you have friends to talk to please reach out 
 it is tough falling in love and not being able to dive fully because of complications on the other side  it sounds to me that you are doing exactly what you need to be doing by taking care of myself while the rest sorts itself out 
your description of the relationship so far is that you are feeling a lot of emotional pain alongside a deep attraction for this woman in some relationships the benefit of what draws us together with someone is being able to learn more about our own deep sense of who we are what we value and care about 
 we live in a world where we are constantly exposed and connected to people who intrigue us and to whom we might feel a connection  i believe that our ability to protect our relationships from the risks involved here has not developed fast enough 
 do you maybe hope that a baby will cement your relationship? it doesnt work that way  do you yearn for a person who will love you deeply? babies dont give to us we give endlessly to them 
suddenly being without a partner is difficult because a relationship absorbs and offers much of a persons energy stay focused on what you know about yourself which is that youre not ready for another relationship 
 i dont think so if your ex is using the children to manipulate or is generally controlling the separation process thats confirmation that getting out was the right decision 
 i think that the best thing you can do is let him know that you are there for him if he wants to talk about things  you can also help by presenting options that he has and help him weigh out the pros and cons of his decision but ultimately he has to decide what to do 
 do you know what type of relationship you want with him? a friendship onlycasual datingor an exclusive relationship? i would encourage you to first figure that out and then communicate to him how you are feeling  ask him to be honest with you about how he feels and what he wants from your relationship as well 
the people need to get along happily too lets start with knowing more about your happiness in being with your partner 
 you deserve respect but right now youre not acting as if you deserve it when you push to see him as hes moving on with a new relationship  its appropriate now for you to respect that relationship and listen to what he says he wants which is space 
youre on the right track by knowing and sticking with your own standards of what qualifies as acceptable behavior by your boyfriend since he was the one who broke your trust he is one in the position of earning back your trust 
 its also understandable that you would feel helpless and guilty given that you see how these thoughts are effecting your relationship though i would encourage you to go easy on yourself and remember that you arent choosing to have these thoughts  im sure that if there was a switch to turn them off you would flip it 
the dog is in a new place without the ability to understand the reason  this may explain what sounds like the dogs agitation 
 often times arguments are not the best opportunities to try and make a point as strong emotions can get in the way of understanding others perspectives try having a discussion with him about what is bothering you during a time when neither if you are upset or arguing 
 the hurt is there because you are being disrespected  your boyfriend unless youve only told me a small disproportionate part of the bigger picture doesnt tend to treat you like youre important and he dismisses your emotions 
 theres a chicken and an egg and i dont know which came first  one thing i see clearly is that your fiance will always have to have communications with his ex because they have children 
each of you are 50 of the relationship is the 50 which your gf contributes to your relationship based on the same understanding of the couples problem as you have?maybe a good starting place for the two of you to talk about is defining what problem the two of you have as a couple 
 although you say youre happy id suggest looking really carefully at the relationship you have and whether youre getting everything you need  is there a physical connection with your ex that you dont have with your current boyfriend? it could be that your boyfriend is marvelous in many areas but that you just dont feel excited about him for some reason 
 losing someone you love hurts so much  we all long to be loved and to love and to have that experience and then lose it is awful 
im sad that this was your first experience in 25 years with feeling in love  you deserve better 
when we are in relationships trust is so integral to our satisfaction within the relationship  often when we feel we are required to prove ourselves feelings of resentment can replace those feelings of wanting to be supportive 
 if both of you are committed and willing to be fully honest with each other trust can be repaired and become stronger than ever  i would encourage you to seek out professional help as it easy to get derailed by fear when trying to work things out in the absence of trust 
 generally the only way to force someone to get mental health care is if they pose an imminent theft of harm to themself or someone else or if they are unable to care for themself  more importantly is dealing with your safety 
 i live in the other ontario in canada  ill try to help you sort this out 
you gave examples which strongly suggest this quite commonly a person twist someones words to convince then of having problems in seeing or understanding their own and others behavior 
the good news is your own awareness of priorities and expectations from a partner there may not be any bad news depending on whether your boyfriend has the interest to adjust what he does regarding the ex 
 sometimes people shy away from good and positive relationships and companionship because their afraid  they know that its something worth holding on to but most feel they cant handle it and cant meet up to their partners expectations 
what are you gaining from being together and are these gains outweighing how you feel when your companion says the opposite of what he just told you?also examine yourself for any fears of being alone very often people stay in detrimental relationships because of a fear that being alone will feel worse 
the first step of having a dialogue about a relationship is being clear on what you are feeling what you are willing to contribute to the relationship and what you would like having in return from your partner ask your partner if she is willing to have a conversation on these topics 
if i was sitting with you now id ask you to list your reasons start with whatever answers you do come up with and examine each of these a little further 
 you may also want to invest some time and energy in couples therapy  it sounds like there is a lack of trust in your relationship likely a hangover from your beginnings that would be helpful for you both to work through to truly be able to forgive and move forward 
trust your instinct that there is more complexity to feeling good about being in a partnership than simply wanting this to happen in any relationship the complexities of each person combine 
 you live and you learn she will soon realize her mistake and her outtake may be the same yours was  but marriage is a special bond in front of god which means once you are officially married cheating and lieing to eachother will only lead to an early divorce 
 the most important thing to remember is that you can not make her feel a certain way  there is nothing you can do to force her to want to be in a relationship with you 
 begin with a nonjudgmental reflective comment about a recent bothersome event as if it were just then crossing your mind therefore not something youve been consumed with ruminating over  eases the impulse for him to dive straight into defense mode then share how you felt at the time of the event 
how did you caregivers express or not express love towards you? how did they express or not express love towards one another  these early messages become your template for how you have learned to see yourself and what you expect from others 
 im sure there are plenty of people that care and love for you that you are not taking into consideration  sometimes when we get upset we may think irrationally and see the world as all or nothing 
 it sounds like you are concerned that he is building an emotional intimacy with her and spending time doing the sort of things with her that youd otherwise be doing with him  help him understand why this bothers you but try to also be open to allowing him to make friends 
 in order to repair your relationship you will both need toconfront the infidelity  and both of you will need to honor yourselves by communicating your feelings and ensuring that those feelings are heard and validated 
 his fear may be full of information  while its possible to repair relationships after a betrayal its also challenging to do especially so early in your relationship 
 have you checked in with your husband about this in a nonaccusatory way? something like hey babe or whatever sweet name you typically use im so curious what thats all about? do you notice that you are talking out loud? chances are its just how he thinks things through and is not at all about trying to make you crazy its just one of his quirks youll grow to endear  early married life is a time full of discovering one anothers quirks! 
 youre looking for fixeruppers! when you meet these men they need you  and youre filled by fixing them 
 the one common reaction however is to shut down and distance ourselves  her relationship with her grandmother was close given she took care of her up until she passed 
 why did you and your ex break up 3 months ago? in relationships with others you get to see a reflection of yourself  sometimes you may enjoy that reflection other times it may not feel so good 
 however perhaps i could make some suggestions as to where you might look for free counseling  first i must mention that most insurances now cover for many different types of issues including family issues 
 thats huge  really 
 they adore pleasing humans and often love to work on learning what you want and expect from them your girlfriend on the other hand likely has her own desires and needs that she attend to before tuning into yours 
 ooph thats a tough one right?! i know  but heres the thing when you keep trying to process and talk it out with him you keep pushing him away 
 and its very two sided  chances are if you dont feel your partner is being influenced by you they likely dont feel you are being influenced by them either 
 i recommend that you sit and have a discussion with him now that you are calm about why you were upset and how you would like to handle such incidents in the future  if you find yourself becoming upset again i encourage you to take a 20 minute break and then come back to the conversation once you are no longer heated 
 you are already on the road to a happier life with this realization  a lot of women do not recognize that it may be something about them that continues to attract a man like this and will only blame it on the men for treating them that way 
 wow this sounds like a sticky situation however i’m here to help guide you through this decision first and foremost you must ask yourself if you ever loved your sons’ father or was it a situation to where you two got pregnant and stayed together for the child 
 your boyfriend seems to be a very selfish and immature man who reconnects with you when its convenient for him  obviously he has his own issues but i want to address yours 
 i see a few issues here  i wonder why you were both trying to get pregnant when the relationship seemed troubled? some people think that they can fix a broken relationship by getting pregnant and all this does is bring up more problems 
 women in particular tend to be more fluid in their desire to express and experience sex  it is not uncommon for heterosexual women in their midlife to explore new sexual appetites 
 it would be extremely rare for someone to develop feelings of samesex attraction later in life  i would explore whether the attraction you are experiencing is sexuallybased or intimacybased 
 sexual preference exists on a continuum  over the course of many years a persons sexual preference may shift 
 it is possible to find yourself attracted sexually or affectionally to different types of people at different times in your life  
 as young children we love everyone  it was as we got older that the social constructs had us make a choice 
the best one will be the one you decide after reflecting on your own reasoning as to your sexual attraction change sometimes people inhibit their sexuality bc of fear others will disapprove 
 there are people on the spectrum who are clearly gay or clearly heterosexual and then there is everyone in between which includes being bisexual which i guess in the spectrum would be smack in the middle?it may be too early for you to identify as any one thing on that spectrum as you say but i dont really know or maybe as you move through life you just wont identify as any one thing and thats totally okay  the most important thing in my professional opinion is to accept yourself fully for whatever it is that you are 
 some people look at it on a continuum where being attracted to only boys is at one end only girls is at the other and bisexual is in the middle  anywhere in between those points can be any amount of attraction to boys or girls 
 sharing a part of your private life without your permission can be so painful  i might suggest depending on your relationship reaching out to your sister and discussing this or setting boundary that you dont want to discuss your private life 
 hopefully you will have a conversation or in reality several conversations about relationship expectations of privacy are there things your wife would prefer you not share with her family? without exploring what is or isnt okay through healthy dialog its entirely possible she felt her sister was in the circle of people she could share this with  all that said though  
 nobody deserves to be outed without their permission  i would encourage you to get in touch with someone who is supportive and accepting and plan to touch base with them after you see your wifes sister 
 its possible to look like a girl and feel more like a boy just as its possible to feel halfway between a boy and a girl or anywhere else on a horizontal line with two points between it  some people use different pronouns or words to express their gender and thats okay 
 gender is actually looked at on a spectrum  transgender is just one of those terms but looking at the information here may helphttpwww 
 the most important part is not who people think you are but that you know who you are  read about gender identity and fluidity 
measure the significance of your answer to the significance of the person who is asking you the question in addition you are stating the simple truth so theres nothing wrong with stating what is on your birth certificate 
examining these factors whether inwardly by yourself in online blogs and sites or live with other people requires patience and effort the more you are willing to commit to figuring out your own truth the greater is your chance of finding it! 
 coming to terms with the idea that you might be of a sexuality other than the one in which you were socially raised to be can be emotionally disturbing and quite unsettling  it creates anxiety maybe even panic and leaves us feeling confused and uncertain about our own sense of identity 
 i like that youre honest enough with yourself to say im struggling with this  to accept that there is a question is a brave place to be 
concentrate on your own satisfaction and that you are doing this in a nonharming way maybe if you branch out your interest by finding other people who enjoy crossdressing as much as you do 
my question to you would be what is making you feel tornabout it? there is unfortunately still a lot of negative stigma associated withpeople who express their gender or sexuality in ways that differ from themajority  and sometimes certain sexual interests are actually very common oreven in the majority but because people carry shame about being different whenit comes to gender and sexuality we assume we are all alone!being a sexual or gender minority or someone whoparticipates in kink or expresses their sexuality or gender identity in aunique and personal way often means suffering from something calledinternalized oppression 
if you would like to become more comfortable with it or express more feelings about it i recommend that you see a local mental health professional not because there is anything wrong with what you are doing but so you can learn more about yourself in the process  you may find that doing this in private and having a partner who accepts that is your view of how you would like things to be 
 what a huge decision  i am writing from toronto canada so it is hard for me to direct you specifically 
 we get a lot of pressure from others and even ourselves to define who we are and what we wantat a pretty early age  the truth is our sexuality canchange and grow in directions we never imagined 
 it could mean that you just havent connected with anyone you find attractive or that you are asexual  essentially not oriented toward anyone  i would suggest doing some reading on asexuality and see if it connects to how you feel! 
 i agree with my colleagues about researching asexuality but i want too add a couple of things about thathere is a website that you can start with to get some information about asexuality  httpwww asexuality 
 your sexual preference is based on who you are attracted to not what does not turn you on  if you find you have no sex drive at all this is called asexual 
 it can be difficult to handle such a transition on your own  i work with clients to understand their needs and wants 
 i am so glad that you reached out for help  i know that the dysphoria can feel nearly impossible to handle especially since you have limited support from people who accept who you are 
 i dont know your age or gender so please excuse any incorrect assumptions about you being under 18 and use what is useful from the ideas if you are older  one idea is to research online to find a therapist or a local clinic that has a therapist who is a gender therapist or a gender specialist 
 i think it can depend on what kind of dysphoria you have  sometimes its physical social or mental  sometimes physical dysphoria means less time around mirrors or plans to make showering less stressful music audio books distraction 
 exploring your sexual orientation and attraction is a wonderful opportunity to get to know yourself! i would be curious to know what feelings you might have related to the possibility of being bi what messages you may have received related to this orientation and any concerns you have about possible sexual orientations  
 surely this is a very confusing time for you! if you have never had thesefeelings and desires it could certainty shake everything you thought you knewabout yourself  my guess is that you becoming sick around the time that thisstarted is likely a coincidence but i understand how you would make theconnection 
having questions is a very valuable way of more clearly defining your sexuality write one or two of your questions if youd like a more specific focus to your general search about your sexual preference 
 this is a topic that is best discussed with a therapist that specializes in lgbtq issues  from what you have written it sounds as if you still have some confusion as to where you fit in with the labeling system 
i am unsure how old you are  if you are a child or teenager this is a normal time to have identity questions and to be in a phase where you are trying to figure out who you are and what you want out of life 
 there is not just boy and girl  it is ok to be a boy and feel feminine and date women 
 the question i always ask them is what are you getting from sneaking out that you arent getting at home? many teens answer they are hooking up using substances and engaging in other risky behaviors  as uncomfortable as it might be i encourage you to talk with your parents or guardians about the reasons why you are sneaking out 
 if thats the case could you ask for their help? sometimes just knowing someone else is holding you accountable really makes a difference  that could be as simple as dad checking in on you at say 2 am just to make sure you are where you are supposed to be 
 usually we are getting something good out of these bad behaviors such as feeling excited or taking our minds off of bad things  it is really hard to change these things without helping us get the good effect in a more healthy way 
 that cannot be unpacked online but im glad that youre in this space and asking this question  try to find a therapist who seems like a good fit and begin to get to work on this issue and what all is going on for you 
if for example youre sneaking out because your parents are arguing and you feel hurt by this and want to escape hearing their arguments then you can come up with other ways to hear less of their arguments if you sneak out bc your parents restrict your friends or time to socialize with your friends and your friends are doing legal and safe behaviors then maybe you could do some socializing online w them 
 in particularly a kind of therapy called exposure response ritual prevention therapy is considered the gold standard for the treatment of ocd  what this is is a specific protocol that helps you build relaxation strategies and to increase the amount of time between your checkingcleaning rituals while also helping you to face any of the fears that ocd given you until those rituals and fears are no longer interfering with your life 
first read about different types of therapy for ocd so that you find a therapist who does the type of therapy which feels best when you read about it  
 sometimes we get tied to one thing we really want to do and it can feel pretty intense when that gets interrupted or doesnt work out  this said youre coming to counselchat and so im guessing this is something that is pretty intense for you and something that you are concerned about 
this way you can interrupt your own patterns a little bit at a time  
 you are not at all alone youve taken the first and very important step in regulating your moods by just identifying that you are having these intense changes instead of being completely submerged in them and unaware! the more you are able to be a witness to your emotions and thoughts the more you can learn to manage them 
 i want you to know that a lot of people will hear a voice at some point in their lives and that there are many things that cause voices  oftentimes significant stress can offset us to have symptoms like this 
i dont know if you can understand when the voices are saying but i wonder how you feel about what you are hearing? if the voices are just at night is it possible that they are part of a nightmare or a dream?if you recall your nightmares consider writing them down so that you can remember their content and work with a mental health professional to look for patterns one thing that may help you while you are awake is to try to stay connected to the room youre in 
 many times when people go to trough traumatic incidents or changes in their lives without being equipped to manage them and as a result they start having similar symptoms  it is helpful to find a therapist to talk to about those dreams and voices once you get them out you could analyze the concerns and fears that they reflect and normalize them which will also be a good time to discuss their source if any traumatic event has occurred in your life 
even though the nightmares are horrible they are one way your psyche is trying to come to terms w extraordinary difficulty in your life or someones life whom you feel greatly attached  
 it could anything and it will change your life to know what your particular issue or trigger is  please contact us a call with the method that is most comfortable for you 
 if you are hearing voices while awake see a doctor right away  if the voices are strictly in your dreams do call for therapy and talk to your caring others about whats happening 
 basically this is when a person shows signs of a fullon seizure such as falling and convulsing but they are not producing brain waves consistent with a seizure  psedoseizures tend to be brought on by high stress emotional challenges and trauma history 
your doctor knows you better than any of the therapists who write on this blog   and because your doctor knows your health will likely have suggestions and advice for you regarding the seizures she thinks you may develop 
my best educated guess is that you could have a seizure during which you have some sort of symptoms similar to a hallucination which is one of the psychotic symptoms when you hear or see things that arent really there in looking briefly online i was able to find some information herehttpwww 
 i want to acknowledge how scary they can feel but there is hope and new skills you can learn to work with these types of thoughts  the first step in working with scary or negative thoughts is to acknowledge that they are just thoughts and we can choose to follow the scary thought streams or work with cutting them off or ignoring them 
i would just add that typically the most natural response to fearful thoughts is to want to stop avoid or get rid of them  which doesnt work if youre really caught up in a cycle of ocd or other form of anxiety in the long run the more effective thing to do is the harder and less intuitive option to have those uncomfortable thoughts on purpose 
 these are thoughts that seem to come from no where and victimize us  i can strongly recommend a book called when panic attacks by dr 
 studies have been done that show that 80 of human thoughts are negative so you are not alone i like to think of thoughts as a tornado 
none of us are able to directly stop thoughts from coming what is possible is to question their value accuracy and believability 
 sometimes when i have a person in my office that is very selfcritical i have himher speak to his or herself as though heshe were speaking to a loved one  isnt it sad that we speak to others more lovingly than we do ourselves?if you have not received empathy nurturing or comfort from a caregiver it is hard to internalize empathy nurture or comfort from the inside 
it may be helpful to also find other things that give you comfort and to practice telling yourself that it will be okay in your own voice  if you start to do that slowly it may be more comfortable for you 
if you ignore the person then their thinking is that there is something wrong with you ignoring the person to the degree this is possible in the situation or relationship will spare you to be misunderstood further 
depending on who is the person doing this and your relationship to them it is possible to kindly point out that the person may unnecessarily hurt someones feelings if you express your thoughts and give your guidance then whatever the person does afterwards you have the peace of knowing you tried to redirect this behavior 
attraction based on physicality is normal  as long as you have no negative thoughts of doing harm to the person or yourself which are connected to the attraction you feel and so long as your attraction isnt stopping you from doing your daily life responsibilities such as work to take care of your daily needs and any responsibilities you have for other people then eventually it will lose its power on you 
 its great you are able to realize there are other issues going on with someone who feels possessive  at the root of it is fear 
 changing unwanted behavior is one of the hardest things a person can do  i agree with sherry that being patient with yourself is important 
what the roots are of this fear are usually easiest to identify by talking with someone whom you trust and feel safe to talk about your inner thoughts and emotions if you havent got someone like this in your life which is common then shop around for a therapist because a therapist is someone who is professionally trained to listen in a way which helps someone know more about who they are 
 people with this type of dissociation may feel disconnected from their bodies feel that they are watching their bodies from a distance or may not recognize their image in the mirror  dissociation sometimes occurs after someone experiences something traumatic 
 im glad you have awareness and im glad you are not at ease with killing frogs fairly likely that you were acting out aggressively toward the frog feelings of being on the receiving side of similar type of violence 
 do you feel angry or sad or anxious when you think about how helpless he is? if you have not actually kicked him then i would encourage you to look at feelings other than guilt since you did not hurt him  what else is there?it would probably be very helpful to talk with a therapist about the specifics of this so that you can see what else is happening for you 
 it could be that she misses friends that she felt safe in the other house emotionally safe and comfortable or dozens of other things  will she talk about it when shes not mad? you mentioned that she has an attachment issue 
 if this is a onetime event it could be that your daughter had an intense moment of anger and the phrase of asking her to calm down may have made her feel as though you werent understanding what she was saying  bipolar disorder also includes feelings of depression 
 this is not as tempting then  having said that maybe you can reward yourself with different things such as having dessert on certain days 
 bipolar disorder isgenerallycharacterized by extreme changes in mood ranging from mania highs to depression lows  there are different types however so here is awebsite thatgives you a list of symptoms for mania and depression in bipolar disorder httpwww 
 if you do seek a medical evaluation from your primary care physician  there are great medications and psychotherapy that can help you live your life to the fullest 
i cant agree that they happen forno reason at all  finding out the reason is going to be your biggest challenge because that may require you to dig deep into your past uncover hurtful experiences orrecognize something that would be extremely pain 
 you notice that there are both desirable and undesirable things about him and this is true of everyone to one degree or another  one question that i would have for you is are you satisfied with your relationship with him as it currently stands? are you happy with the boundaries between the two of you or would you like them to be different? negotiating through conflict and establishing different boundaries are definitely things you could work on with the help of a therapist 
 it is fine to play in your mind with what ifs   people who write horror movie scripts most likely have some terrible sounding stories and suppositions 
 the small thing is a trigger and the emotions arent so much about that event thats happening in the present they are more connected to old events that evoked the same feeling  youve likely had too much of that feeling in your life and youve developed a sensitivity to it 
since you describe your laziness as an observable quality i assume youve not always felt or handled yourself this way quite possibly and more likely the particular conditions of your current life are not ones that are optimal for feeling good about yourself and your involvements 
 it sounds to me like you are suffering from depression to some degree  have you seen a therapist or talked to anyone about your problems? if not i would advise that you do so sooner than later so that you can learn what is causing you to be unmotivated and causing difficulty with breaking the cycle that you are in 
 if i was your therapist id ask you questions about your worries and how this is causing a problem in your life  youre causing perhaps permanent changes damage? to your body and its likely youre trying to express something 
 there are a few different types of bipolar diagnoses in the dsm diagnositc and statistical manual and the best way to find out if your experiences would meet that diagnosis would be to meet with a mental health professional  you can also look up the diagnosis online and see if what you are going through meets the criteria 
always being focused on what a phone offers keeps people at a distance from knowing themselves as long as you make time to spend in an activity which is not interactive the way a phone is and instead depends only upon your actions you will be investing time and energy into your own life 
in fact it is not uncommon for state regulatory boards to determine that a clinician and client being in the same 12 step group is professional misconduct you might want to consider attending a 12 step meeting that is located in a different community than the one you work in 
 i know that workplaces have some latitude when it comes to requiring certain behaviors from their employees  for example they may require you to tell them if you get into some kind of legal trouble 
 this sounds like a really difficult situation for the whole family  since the answer to this question will depend a lot on the applicable state laws i would suggest talking with a local attorney 
 generally therapists only have a duty to report self harm to ones self or others if it is expressed to them  often times they will not report relapses due to the fact that proper releases were not signed or patient has specifically asked them not to for fear of shaming or failure again 
 the most important thing is to make sure the child is safe  if you suspect that a child is or has been harmed i would strongly recommend that you report your concerns to your local law enforcement or to child protective services 
 are you the other parent in question or a concerned coworker of this therapist?therapists do not prescribe or have access to medication  most therapists wont even get involved in a custody battle 
in this case if your treatment team decided to discontinue your treatment based on a diagnosis of schizophrenia they still will likely be required to provide you with a referral to someone who can provide you with treatment  if you havent already done so id recommend that you explicitly ask for a referral 
maybe if you could explain that to her she would be willing to work with you if she is not willing to consider your explanation and if she is not willing to continue working with you she still has an ethical obligation to provide you with referral resources to another therapist 
 this is even true if the social worker or counselor is unable to make an appointment with the caller  in that case the social worker should call you back to let you know that he is unable to schedule an appointment with you 
it is the professional ethic to do so and plain human decency to do so if he doesnt there is nothing you can directly do about the fact of his ignoring you 
 there might be a few options  if you are in school id recommend talking to a school counselor or school nurse 
it was definitely a good thing that you told your primary care physician about what is going on  i know that must have been difficult to talk about with him 
 when a client has met their goals that is a good time to end counselling sessions unless the client has new goals or simply wants to checkin periodically to make sure that they are still on track sometimes referred to as relapse prevention when a client is not progressing and feedback has been taken and attempts have been made to make the therapy more helpful for the client but to no avail than it is considered unethical to continue to work with the client 
 the end of the counselorclient relationship is one of mutual respect and engagement  counseling sessions can end for any number of reasons 
 its really helpful for the client to leave counseling with a solid sense of what he or she has accomplished in counseling so it can be a good idea to spend some time acknowledging that in the last session or sessions  sometimes however a client has needs beyond the scope of the counselors expertise 
 here are a few examples the counselor may determine that the clients needs are outside what the counselor is competent to be able to work with 
in counseling there is an arc to the process  a beginning middle and end 
when best when the job is done  
 usually during the initial evaluation i identify my client’s short term and long term therapy goals  as therapy progress we verify goals on a monthly to a quarterly basis depending on the frequency of the appointments 
 there are exceptions to this rule but for the most part this is when counselors begin termination  for some clients this is an easy process that marks the achievements they have made in working through their emotions and difficulties 
 in the case of a termination because a clients distress has resolved i might periodically check in with the client about how therapy has been going and if we want to reevaluate where we are the more unfortunate situation would come about if i felt that i wasnt the best fit for the client 
 its not that the therapist kicks the client out at some point and says okay youre done  rather over time the client will decrease the frequency with which heshe comes to session so that it may start off as weekly then decrease to biweekly then perhaps once every three weeks then oncemonth and so on 
 one that is not entered into lightly while there are many considerations counselors take into account to help answer this question ill offer an example of two areas that counselors take into consideration when ending counseling sessionsdoes the client need different or more specialized care than the current counselor can provide? this requires the counselor to determine whether referring the client to another therapist or health care provider is needed 
 in short therapy ends when you feel your done c 
 if a client appears to have less to talk about in sessions appears more stable for a period of time and has reached therapeutic goals i will talk about termination  some clients however i may continue with on a monthly or bi monthly process to allow for checkins to see how they are doing and if they need more help at that time 
 a major reason to end counseling is if the counselor feels that he or she does not have the skills or experience to work with the client  this may happen during the intake process or after working with the client for some time 
 even if the therapist believes the client is not making progress the client may feel they are improving and receiving a benefit  and the therapist may see a benefit and the client does not 
chances are most of the goodbyes you have experienced in your life have beendifficult  saying goodbye to a therapist can be different 
 if not ive had the discussion initiated both ways by me when i sense the client has gone has far as they want by lack of interest in accepting or completing homework assignments missing or cancelling appointments usually at the last minute lack of participation during sessions  client initiates by asking me pointed questions about why the need for homework assignments by forgetting their calendar or their checkbook   by suggesting that we make appointments over longer intervals once a week to once a month for example 
otherwise the person can end up with a sense of tremendous rejection and abandonment the way youll both know therapy is coming to a close is that the discussion will feel lighter and move easily 
 the last aspect should likely be taken to supervision in order to be fully processed  all of these things could happen and usually happen organically again except for the last example 
 there are definitely some variables but i can give you some general ideas for when counseling might endwhen a client has met all of their goals at least to a degree when they feel that they no longer need to work on them with the assistance of a counselorsometimes a decision is made that a client is no longer benefiting from counseling at a certain timesometimes clients have to remain in counseling in order to receive medication  this depends on agency policy but sometimes it is a requirement 
counselors are legallyand ethically required to make sure that they always put the wellbeing of their clients above their own interests in addition counselor ethical rules and the laws in just about every state make it illegal for counselors to take advantage ofa client financially 
therapists are expected to keep very clear boundaries between the therapy work and not have other relationships such as friend or money lender with someone who is their patient therapists are never friends with their patients 
e  licensed professional counselor social worker psychologist are expected to put the health and wellbeing of the client first 
regarding the length of schooling it generally takes 4 years of college and an additional 4 to 7 years of graduate school to earn a doctorate degree to become a psychologist there are also other similar professions including counseling that dont require a doctorate degree 
 i hear you saying that you want to be a psychologist and that is one path to working in mental health  you could study psychologysocial work or counseling to become a practicing therapist 
in general it is not appropriate for counselors to accept gifts from their clients there are some exceptions to this general rule  including a recognition that there may be a valid cultural aspect to this type of gift giving 
 your counselor helped you and supported you which is great but a gift is inappropriate  i can understand that you want to show your gratitude 
 its important to me that i be sensitive to cultural norms and to my clients needs  in canada and the us it is customary for people to sometimes express gratitude with a small gift and i have from time to time received small tokens of appreciation because i believe it would be rude to refuse this 
my recommendation in a situation like this would be to let your counselor know how you feel  specifically tell your counselor that you dont seem to be getting the amount of feedback you would like 
 are you letting your therapist know what your goals are? its okay to say id really like us to focus on this piece or im looking for specific direction about how to manage this part  your therapist is wise if they ask questions that determine what your needs are but they cant read your mind 
 but remember you are the expert on you  any good medical professional will recognize that 
 im glad you realize that you need extra support and are being proactive  simply explain to your doctor the feelings you have been experiencing and how you feel that speaking with a mental health therapist would be beneficial 
we live with crumbling of our values which then gives rise to insecurity everywhere  if someone doesnt know what their values are then its difficult to do anything and right now everyday we hear uncertainty in what used to be our basic assumptions 
 sometimes stress can seem more than it really is  one thing that i encourage my clients to do is to ask themselves what is this stressor really about? simplifying stress is a key to minimizing stress and leads to feeling less stressed out 
 between a demanding job family responsibilities and everything else that can come up stress becomes more and more part of our everyday life  one of the best ways to combat the toxic effects of stress on our bodies social lives and overall well being is to engage in selfcare 
there are the outward answers of selfpampering and making your home and work environment as pleasant as possible a deeper level way to decrease stress is through exercise or alternative practices like yoga or tai chi 
 so that means taking slower fuller breaths and trying to relax any areas where we might be gripping our muscles  check out meditation apps such as breathe which can talk you through a relaxing breath exercise 
 i recommend a mindful based stress reduction mbsr program  
 a great car on an empty tank will not get you very far  
if you grew up having enough interaction with your dad to know youd have liked more and didnt receive this then maybe your longings of childhood are still active within you it is ok to like older men 
 what youre experiencing is normal  were sexual beings 
 you are doing well to reflect on your actions in the truthful way you are doing also positive is that you have perspective that at your age and social maturity you were innocently doing something that in adult terms would be considered in a negative way 
 and if a person only jokes then after laughing and realizing the person has nothing of themselves to offer this can also be quite tedious realize that you are more aware of human interaction having many levels of expression 
its possible if you offer your friend expressions of your empathy toward her over an extended time possibly shell forgive you youre certainly learning relationship lessons on how to treat people and the effect of betraying another person which will last forever 
 i dont know how long it has been but perhaps if your friend is willing to discuss other things with you for a little while you could discuss this at some point in the future hopefully the true intentions will become apparent in the idea that it was a prank 
just google psychopaths and leadership and many articles come up about boardroom politics and that psychopaths are very successful in these roles theoretically is it terrible that corporate leadership qualities match those of psychopaths? well yes 
 men and women with these characteristics can become violent  they can also make your life difficult by creating financial or legal trouble for you 
more than likely the nonresponse has less to do with liking you than w liking the way you write your messages have you tried asking a question in your posts? this would be one way to invite people to answer your post 
 if these friends are inperson as well as online perhaps going to them in person and asking talking to them about your concern  perhaps its the way you send messages or the way they are receiving them 
i wonder about how your friendships are in person  if you get along well with people and have effective conversations with them facetoface there could be some kind of technologyrelated problem 
 feeling intimidated by another person is very unsettling stop having contact with the person 
 i would ask you to question why you continue to remain together as friends i always believed that a relationship should emit positivity towards all parties involved if your in a relationship that is onesided it is inevitable that it will start to decompensate  never travel with the circus never travel with fools everything in life should have some positive payout will things at times be negative of course they will but in order to keep something or someone in your life there should be more positivity than negativity 
 but what makes friendships special is that they last trough time at least with those who we call our true friends those who know us well and whom we have a special connectionand those from whom we disconnect at times without fear of losing them consider what is that you are going trough yourself and with your relationship talk to your friend about your concern let him her know that you would like to spend more time together 
 often times when we have difficulty trusting others it is because we have specific fears about what would happen if we get close or let our guard down  such fears may be rooted in past experiences in relationships in which we were hurt and or disappointed 
i suggest a conversation with the entire group of girls in which you tell them how you actually are feeling about their opinions about the dresses one topic you may consider bringing up is what everyone expects to get out of the party 
 i’m here to tell youthat living in the now or being mindful is a skill anyone can learn  unfortunatelythe only way to do it is to do it 
the dynamic of living one day at a time and letting go of past problems is more imaginary and wishful than real it is a popular notion of tv fb and media 
 if we feel successful in that area it can give us the confidence and hope to tackle anything life throws at us there are personal barriers we all have to having healthy relationships its our stuff our baggage not a steam trunk right 
 journal at the end of the day of how well you did that day in focusing on these things  each day should be a step better than the previous day 
 that is all we can do so keep saying this to yourself and try to help someone each day  the happiness is helping others to feel a bit better 
what im reading is that you find yourself in a loop of seeking validation of your thoughts and feelings from your friends rather than validating yourself  am i right? if you arent validating yourself no one else will be able to either 
 i would recommend speaking with your friends facetoface to address why they feel your behavior is concerning inperson contact is the best method of sorting out differences considering texts emails or any written response can be misconstrued 
 but you are not alone  i have several schoolaged clients who find little to no assistance from their teachers at their schools regarding bullying 
4 access your own mother and father and tell them what you have experienced and see if they will helplong term society must return to a more masculine way of being such that these sorts of troubles are dealt with at the home learn to be manwoman and watch the magic happen  
im glad you know the bullies are doing the wrong thing and whatever they are telling you is pure meanness depending on how independent you feel why not tell either your classroom teacher or schedule an appointment with the vice principal?bullying other students is taken very seriously in some states and schools are expected to address the bullying until the victimized student feels safe 
 you could validate his feelings by saying something like i know you want to see mom and dad right now but they are working and then give him a couple options of things that may take his mind off of it  this could be choosing what he has for breakfast or playing a game of his choice 
 it could be helpful to talk with his parents and establish a routine that he would be comfortable with  
the fact that by afternoon he is happy with you shows more likelihood that he reacts to the parents departure more than who you are  
 you may also be required to go to the military police or security office on base to report the loss of your old id card  
 they are located outside of the gate so you do not need a military id to enter  if you have another form of identification it’s possible that they can give you a pass in order to go and obtain a new military id 
 first you can go to the visitors center and let them know what has happened to get a temporary pass for a new id  also you can call the squadron commander or other official from your husbands unit to get them to tell you how to proceed 
 when i am determining what type of personality a client has i take my time and really absorb their lens point of view to themselves and others  determining a personality type takes some time getting to know the person and building rapport 
 there is such a wide range of ways to define personality that it is difficult to identify specific characteristics that are used to identify personality types that being said some clinicians will use standardized tests or assessments to assess a clients type of personality 
as long as someone is sincerely trying to know more about themselves my work is help the person clarify who they really are and how their true self may be quite different than the life the person created for themselves based on satisfying other peoples standards in broad terms personality disorders have stock characteristics which change very minimally over time instead of uniqueness which constantly flows and changes with circumstances over time 
 sometimes these feelings are a result of low self esteem or because of shame  the most important part of dealing with this thought is to separate feelings from reality 
 one things that can be helpful is to identify if there is a trigger to these thoughts  something in your life that makes these thoughts more common an experience a person a place a situation etc  
 being able to manage your thoughts and choose what to think about yourself is something you would learn in counseling  an effective treatment modality for this situation is cognitive behavioral therapy 
 so in that sense these thoughts are yours and belong to you but you have received these messages from somebody else  even though we all receive messages like this at times it pays to be careful not to ignore other messages we are receiving such as a loved one appreciating your help or attention a friend responding to encouragement or a colleague showing interest in you 
 from what ive learned from clients i work with often these thoughts have been quite useful for them over the course of their lives that through criticizing oneself it is a way of motivating oneself  however in your case and in most of those clients it has caught up to them and its almost like they no longer need the motivation that they can do just fine motivating themselves by themselves!i think its important to see these thoughts as the voice of the inner critic 
 some thoughts we choose to think and some thoughts are random as you describe  we cant control the first random thought but as soon as we become aware of it we can make a conscious choice to change the thought 
 when young children hear negative things about themselves they tend to internalize these negative ideas and to form negative core beliefs  the good news is we can learn to stop these thoughts and to replace them with healthier thoughts 
as a general information in short i can say that our thoughts are greatly influencedby our early life experiences  our thoughts are processed through schemes these are mental images or templates by which we make meaning of the world around us 
 with proper strategies and tools it is possible to regain control over your thoughts  i guess you are just having thoughts and not actually hearing voices? my suggestion is to see a therapist and go from there 
 in fact having random thoughts we feel we cannot control is actually quite common and normal  sometimes our thoughts think they are protecting us if we think we arent worth anything it wont hurt when we get rejected but they are actually doing quite the opposite 
when we are too young to distinguish whether what a grown person tells us feels accurate we absorb their opinions as our own your question shows youve reached the point of emotional maturity to know that your opinion about yourself is not the same as what is inside your emotional brain and stored there since you were too young to know that someone elses opinions are not necessarily your opinions 
 on the other hand naming the problem can also make it stick around longer as in now i have a special problem that has a special name and thats an important part of who i am bottom line whether its a disorder or not you would like life to be easier and not have to be pulled so much by other peoples energy and feelings 
you may or may not know that we all have chemicals in our brain  we also have different sections of our brain that become active when different things happen 
 since youre giving a lot of empathy maybe youd like receiving a lot of empathy in the situation you describe when you start empathizing with others real or cartoon ask yourself whether youve felt empathy coming in your direction lately 
 it can sometimes take a number of sessions to get a good sense of whether you and your therapist are the right fit  the first couple of sessions are generally spent on gathering information formulating a plan of treatment and building the clienttherapist relationship 
 having a therapist who has a good location and inviting office is also a good sign that you have the right one! 
 youll feel that they not only understood what you were saying but that they were also able to catch the in between the lines part and put into words what you have not been able to  the relationship with your therapist should be collaborative there should be a fundamental element of safety and trust 
 it is so important for you to find a therapist that you trust and feel comfortable enough to just lay everything out there and be vulnerable with  therapy is really building a safe and healthy relationship with a professional that can then help guide you in some of the most intimate and emotional parts of your life 
they are ethical and are able to understand your culture or religious norms they are licensed in your state 
 a good therapist should first be someone you can trust and second someone who encourages you to be honest with yourself  therapy is a time to learn new coping skills and learn more about yourself 
 my private practice uses life coaching though i amprofessionally qualified in many therapeutic modalities  the therapeuticrelationship is the initial step of any treatment program or goal attainmentprocess 
think of them as a mechanic who should be able to fix your car relatively quickly and if he doesnt fix it you fire him  
 heres why i say thatone quite important healing factor in a psychotherapy is discovering that problems in the therapy and the therapeutic relationship can be solved together it is a safety zone or bridge for practicing that 
 i will balance the needs of your temperament with scripture prayer and cognitive therapy techniques  
 your therapist should be able to challenge you when necessary and be able to provide support at other times  i dont know if you can really train your therapist to give you what you need from treatment 
 don’t be afraid to ask questions about the therapist’s approach and background   do you feel heard and understood? do you find the feedback helpful and directed toward achieving your goals 
 sounds like a big ole “duh”  but you will not believe the number of people i have met with that have described their past counselor as “totally opposite than me” or someone who “didn’t get me” or “had totally opposing beliefs as me” 
 questions questions questions! first i would ask them if they have experience and training in whatever the primary issues are that you are wanting to work on  you want to make sure the therapist has the skills and experience to help you 
 your relationship with your therapist is like any other relationship  
 you can also determine whether a therapist is the right fit if you feel a connection or alliance and feel that you are working together toward your goals  it is important to be open and honest with your therapist about what you are looking for in counseling 
 its important to be aligned with your therapists general approach and to find someone who you feel genuinely attuned to both in practice and also with who they are as a person  bringing up your needs for treatment is key and finding someone who validates your needs listens and welcomes feedback are all important building blocks for creating space for a great working relationship that promotes personal growth openness and invites adaptable approaches in session based on your individual needs 
 but in my view what is important to checkin with yourself around whether or not the therapist can hold space for all that you come in with for example not expressing discomfort with things you might talk about is a big run away challenge you enough where you feel like it is challenging you to grow but also where there is some part of you that does look forward to the sessions how to train your therapist? this could be a session in and of itself i must say the therapistclient relationship can resemble many of the relationships in your life or those that you seek out 
 i encourage you to start by checking out the website of the therapist  their blog articles will reflect the kind of work they do and the approach they may take while working with you 
 feeling comfortable with your therapist and feeling that you can be vulnerable is what will assist in helping you find what you want out of therapy  it also sounds like discussing with a potential therapist your expectations for therapy 
 two important things to think about when first finding a therapist are “do i feel safe?” and “do i feel heard?” the first time seeing a therapist can be anxiety provoking  it may be uncomfortable 
 i gave him some traits some of which were listed byrobinson 2012  the therapist should be able to listen to your story buildrapport establish a relationship demonstrate empathy adapt treatments to theclientsituation use effective communication skills exhibit confidence in useof therapeutic techniques and repeatedly update skills with ongoing educationand research 
 the client is the expert on their life and the therapist is the expert on helping the client to develop their sense of being  growth occurs as a result of challenges 
 its important in therapy for that rapport to be built from the beginning and that you as the client feel comfortable enough to share what you need to share  you shouldnt feel judgement from your therapist and you should be able to trust the advice your therapist provides 
 things to consider are location availability and what specifically are you looking for  some practitioners specifically only work with a certain type of issue i 
 i know many people come to therapy with hesitations and potential fears but a therapist should be there to help you along the way and support you as you build a trusting and collaborative relationship  you wont have to train your therapist to give you what you need 
 trust is earned and gained through the therapeutic process  you may know you have the right therapist if you feel a lack of judgement or even unconditional positive regard for the choices you make in therapy 
you do not hold back and feel total acceptance and validation by your therapist  listen to your feelings and letthem guide your decision 
 while that sounds vague and not very scientific it is the most important part of therapy  us counselors call it therapeutic rapport and without it therapy is not very effective 
once you feel comfortable with your therapist you can have a conversation about what works for you in therapy  tell your therapist what is helpful and what you dont find helpful 
 finding the right therapist can be tricky because you dont really know how someone will be like until you meet them  a few ways to prescreen are to visit the therapists website psychologytoday profile social media etc 
 you should feel comfortable opening up and not be concerned that they will judge you for what you say or decide to do  i find this important to let my clients know during intake that they will never be judged for the decisions they decide to take while going over options in sessions together with me 
 in truth the bond between therapist and client is the 1 predictor of positive outcomes in therapy  ask yourself these questions does it feel like this person can come to care about me? do they remember from week to week what we touched on? do i feel compassion from this person? do they allow me my difficult and painful feelings too or do they try to rescue me? on your other question  i suggest you ask your therapist what goals heshe has for your treatment 
 there could be a few ways to “know”that you’ve found a good fit and you and your therapist are therapeutically compatible first i would recommend listening to your intuition and pay attention to howyou feel if there are feelingindicators that you are comfortable feel safeand willing to open up and share your story 
the most difficult job for a client is willingness to selfexamine hold oneself accountable for relationship and life situations and honestly feel the difficult often painful feelings and insecurities which troubling situations create the client doesnt train the therapist 
 but think of this you feel safe and comfortable that you share what you’ve never told anybody  you feel understood and listened to 
 people generally are quite good at determining whether or not someone fits well with their personality and style and another key to know whether therapy is working is to ask yourself do i see that changes have come about since working with this therapist? do i feel better? am i reaching goals that i set at the onset of therapy? are difficult situations becoming easier by how i handle them? training a therapist really isnt necessary as all it requires is open and honest communication in order to give effective feedback that will in turn be helpful to you and your goals  
 safety consists of feeling that who you are and what you say is valued  the right therapist is not an all knowing person you must obey 
 i think the most important factor that makes a good therapist match is trust do you trust this person to be able to help you meet your therapy goals? there are few things you can do upfront to test this out without spending a dime  first ask for personal recommendations from friends or others 
 there are some things that need to be cried about before they can heal  therapists are fine with tears and buy tissues by the case 
 sometimes clients have stories they never shared with anyone or never said out loud and that results to crying  crying is a normal reaction to feeling hurt or sad or sometimes angry 
 it is an expression of emotions which is why you are going to therapy  to express yourself in a safe nonjudgmental space rather than trying to stop crying sit on the couch with it until it is done and you have finished with the clearing 
 in my opinion crying is a emotion that some express in therapy  crying is something that some express when it’s hard to discuss situations that may have never been discussed when discussing traumatic experiences and at times crying has even happened to some of my past clients when they have had a breakthrough in their therapy process 
 therapy should be a safe space to explore emotions as they come up and how you cope with these emotions  i would encourage you to talk with your therapist about crying and to explore your experience of emotionsfeelings 
 therapy is a place to be honest about and explore your feelings without feeling judged  honesty is the only way you will benefit from therapy and that means being willing to look at your true emotions rather than avoiding them 
therapy is a “safe space” to take time out of your normal daily life andcope with the emotions that are hiding underneath  if for some reason you arenot comfortable in therapy you should address this concern with your therapistor find someone whom you feel more comfortable opening up with and expressyourself comfortably 
 it is a release of energy and toxins  crying is a good thing and a great way to let go and move forward! 
 often you are talking about your deepest challenges and fears so it is quite typical to expect some tears when making yourself so vulnerable  
 therapy provides a space where you can be free to express yourself and experience all of your emotions fully  crying is a form of release and many people feel like they do not have any other space where they can let out their emotions 
weeping provides chemical shifts which also shift the experience youre having  not only are their physical detoxification benefits to crying but there are also emotional releases that come with it 
many people do cry while others do not  some people speak quietly others may yell and some find it painfully difficult to say anything at all in a therapeutic setting 
 it is perfectly ok to cry in counseling! 
 external emotions are a pretty good indicator of whats going on inside the person and if tears are present that often means the person is processing i e 
 every counselortherapist is dedicated to protect the confidentiality with some exceptions of all that happens in session  crying helps to release tension and help secure free emotional space 
 some clients may cry easier than others and there is no right way to do therapy  i have many clients who cry each session 
 in counseling you may be talking about very vulnerable topics and experiences and it may even be the first time you are talking to someone about your concerns thoughts or feelings  it is perfectly natural to cry if you are so moved 
 sometimes crying can offer relief or provide room for deeper authenticity in session as you let both your strength and vulnerability shine in alignment  
 when we are in a safe environment such as a therapists office it allows us to disarm our defenses  by disarming our defenses we are able to feel and express our emotions 
 some people cry frequently but not fully  they’re good at crying but never seem to heal from what’s hurting them 
 some people release endorphins when they cry which can make you feel better than before  if youre concerned about how much you cry during therapy it might be good to discuss with your therapist 
 sometimes you may cry sometimes you may feel joy and sometimes you may feel relief  sometimes you might even feel anger 
 when you meet with a counselor you are opening yourself up and sharing very vulnerable sides of yourself  through this deep introspection emotions sometimes unexpected can come out and this is completely okay and very healthy 
 therapy helps us work through the tough stuff  it’s a safe place where we can let our guards down 
 in therapy you will be delving into topics and feelings that are often suppressed throughout daily life  as you explore many emotions may come up anger disappointment grief frustration sadness to name a few 
 i imagine that you are being vulnerable and open to exploring some deep seeded issues  also it may be a good sign that you feel safe and held with your therapist that you are able to freely express those strong emotions 
 crying is normal and one way to process emotions to help let go and integrate our experiences  
 counseling can be very emotional at times  ive recommended to clients on occation that they allow themselves the rest of the day off after doing trauma work 
 a lot of people if not most cry in therapy  whydoes it happen? during therapy youll explore your thoughts and emotions 
 expressing your feelings is very cathartic and allows you togain a deeper understanding into yourself and how the issue is affecting you  
 therapy should be a place where you feel ok to be vulnerable when you are working through your stuff  its when your mind and your heart finally meet and you make the connections you need to make 
 most people use therapy as a way to process their lifes struggles and often times this results in them crying during session  crying is a way to release those negative emotions and to cope with what is happening in life 
  anyone in the midst of new awareness of how theyve been hurt or feel despair or great sadness from burdensome life situations naturally will feel tears come up therapists are familiar with people crying during a session and will know how to be present for you while you sort through your painful emotions 
 this is part of processing and bringing closure to things that may have been pushed aside for a lifetime and can now be faced and dealt with  change too is often not easy and can lead to crying whether from frustration and set back 
 counseling is a personal process where many emotions can be experienced by people  i i do not believe it is just you who cries in therapy 
 although people often cry or become upset it is in no way a measure of good therapy  c 
 i have had clients cry in therapy out of happiness sadness love joy and from laughing so hard! yes crying is a normal part of therapy for many people  
e  nodding leaning in affirmationsreframing helping a client to see a problematic behavior or situation in a different way usually only works well after they feel heard and understood 
 a good counselor also knows the difference between identifying with their client and empathizing with their client  an ability to not bring in our own baggage we all have baggage and most are wounded healers into our work as its not about us 
also to respect human difference in accomplishing basic life tasks and everyday living  
 but i would not say that the client is more difficult rather the dynamic between myself and the client which constitutes a relationship might feel more difficult  and thats okay sometimes things that feel like the most challenging end up with profound shifts and outcomes 
 even if clinically trained similarly since counselors are human then their response to your question will reflect their unique differences as humans on my list is when the emotional pain i feel for someone describing some type of injustice or unfair treatment by another feels very deep 
 while length of time varies counseling is a process and can be done from as little as one session to multiple sessions  counseling provide a safe nonjudgmental empathetic atmosphere from a professional helper provide the service 
 i believe counseling does help people! of course i am a therapist so i would think that!  seriously  i think therapy and counseling allow us to understand ourselves our motivations and the things that bring us happiness and discontent  therapy can create opportunities to try new skills and enhance positive attributes that are already present in someone 
 the various typesmodalitiestechniques of counseling serve as guides for specific individuals personal journeys  
 knowing your counselor is someone who is really on your side and wants to see you grow past your difficulties into a healthy happy successful life is more important than what kind of counseling method they use  if you are looking for a counselor take your time and be sure you feel heard and respected as well as challenged to grow 
 having a safe place to openly share concerns with an objective listener really is therapeutic and can make a huge difference in your life  many times people dont feel heard or validated by people in their lives counseling call help validate your feelings and help you become more selfaware 
 its a great question and one that many people want to know the answer to  the short answer is yes! counseling can be very helpful to people struggling with many different things 
 for some this process can take a very long winding path of selfdiscovery while for others they are seeking a purposeful solutionbased way to approach and manage a specific problem  its important to remember that there are different styles of therapy some of which will work great with some but poorly with others specifically to help those to decide how they wish to move forward 
 the most basic is that it gives you someone to talk to about and through what you are facing  it is better than a friend because this is a space for your stuff and you get to focus on what you need and dont have to worry about the other side 
2 help you better understand yourself your choices your motivations 3 give you tools and information you can use to help create change in your life 
 my answer is this sometimes  many people benefit from counseling and when counseling works those benefits can show up through positive improvements in your moods making more choices that align with your values working through stuff and a general improved sense of self 
 this relationship is unlike any other as the counselor will act as a facilitator in helping you better understand yourself the world around you your feelings and your behaviors as is the case with most things in life there are both benefits and risks while participating in counseling 
how this happens is bc the counselor can guide the person or couple into deeper areas of their thoughts and emotions than the person or partners would typically avoid or not even realize they are avoiding also a counseling session offers emotional safety because the therapist will intervene with thoughtful questions if someones strong emotions overwhelm them 
 many of my clients have expressed that they are able to find their own answers during the session because they have the right person listening to them  some thought they were safe sharing their concerns with friends or relatives who are good listeners but later they felt ashamed or guilty about what they shared 
 however if you are having a difficult time counseling can be beneficial in helping you move forward and get your life back on track counseling is not like the kind of talking we do to people we know 
 yes counseling can be beneficial to many people  one of the effective components to effective therapy is when the client becomes willing to participate in the counseling 
 most counseling involves homework and a levelof commitment outside of session that also contributes to resolution ofproblems and an ability to cope with stresses in a productive way  here aresome of the key ways that therapy can help 
 being that the universe is not made for us and that the the world tends to be a fairly untamed place at times this sacred space allows us to explore ourselves  it allows for greater reflection upon our attitudes our behaviors and our feelings 
counseling helps you to get new perspective on your life and problems talking about your problems with a counselor gives them substances and something to get a handle on 
 there is a similarity in the sense that hopefully both counselors and friends will listen to what you are experiencing but that is really the end of the similarities  some differences arecounselors are specifically trained to phrase questions or statements in ways that help you to gain more awareness of one could be contributing to what it is that you are trying to change both within yourself and possibly with people around youcounselors have experience in using lots of different types of techniques for example focusing on finding solutions looking at how the present situation could relate to your past using roleplays or examples in session to help you learn new skills or ways of looking at situations and probably hundreds of other thingscounselors are taught to look at what you are experiencing and ask questions about other related ideas that you may not have connected to what you are experiencingthere is a treatment plan in place usually after the first second or third session so both you and the counselor have an idea of where you would like to go with counseling what you are hoping to change or learn and a general idea of a plan for getting to your goalsin general i would say the followingyes counseling can help people who want something to be different in their livescounseling is most helpful when the connection between the counselor and the client is strong enough that some trust forms in other words not every counselor or technique is helpful for every persona lot of counselors will talk to you on the phone for a few minutes prior to you coming in for your first appointment to answer any general questions that you may haveif you are working with a counselor and you feel as though you are not clicking or connecting with one another give it three or four sessions before you change 
 its most definitely an uncomfortable feeling but once that first step is taken it is often met with a wave of relief my recommendation is always to call and speak with a therapist over the phone before scheduling an appointment 
 if you like what you hear by phone the next step is to set up a facetoface meeting  studies show that the most important element in effective therapy is that you feel a connection with your counselor 
 one great website is called psychology today which is a national site  you can search for therapists in your zip code and search more specifically for the issue you are seeking support about 
 counseling often begins way before the client ever actually calls the local therapist  there is often a tipping point in the internal struggle that the client experiences where they can no longer deal with the issues on their own and thus giving the motivation to seek external help 
 once you have the name and contact information for a therapist you want to meet with give them a call  some therapists will provide a free 1520 minute phone consultation 
 too often people search for the help they need via a phone book or a basic internet search  when looking for a new person to add to your team whether it be a counselor plumber or mechanic it is important to know as much as you reasonably can about the person 
com reading the bios of potential therapists who you think you would relate best with then contact them through email or on the phone  
 see if they have areas of focus that line up with your goals and never be afraid to call and set up a consultation  usually these are free of charge and can help you make your decision 
 in my most efficient instances ive been able to setup a consultation within a couple of days which is just 15 minutes by phone to chat a little about what you might want to work on how i may or may not be a good fit etc  then from there if you want to meet in person we can set up an initial session 
 usually the person interested in therapy reaches out to the therapist by telephone or email  i like to respond with appreciation for their making contact and ask if they are available for a phone consultation in order to see how i may be able to help 
 the decision to pursue therapy can be a very difficult one and the fact that there seem to be so many profiles that you have to wade through can be particularly daunting  heres what i suggest to make the process a bit easier1 narrow down your preferred geographical area 
 what are the issues that are most troubling you? are these situations creating an impact on your daily routine?second do some research as to the type of counselling service you are looking and that would best suit your needs  are you looking for individual sesssions couplesfamily sessions etc 
 you have every right to interview the therapist and ask as many questions as you need  it is our job as a therapist to explain our approach and philosophy 
firstid start with finding a therapist through a therapist directory and searching for a therapist specifically in your area and with the expertise youre looking for  there are many reputable therapist directories online that offer specific information and links to therapist websites to learn more about how they can help 
 a quick search for the type of counseling you are looking for can be helpful  there are lots of counselors out there to choose from so many times you will have to take it a few steps further than that 
 you can often find counselors using search engines like counselchat or psychology today  these websites allow you to get to know therapists before you take the next step 
 you need to look at it like you are interviewing the counselor and that they will be able to provide you with the therapy you need  to many times we do not know and it ends up not being a good fit and then people are left with a bad experience and do not want to reengage 
 search online and then set up a phone consultation  a person can find out a lot about a counselor and the services that they offer over the phone 
ask to get a feel as to the way the person would handle your problem and work with you in my practice i offer a phone consult which generally continues for twenty minutes 
 so i might explore both their present circumstances as well as their history and try to start making some connections between the two but so that the both of us can understand what is taking place  not every therapist goes into history in the same way either 
 this is an excellent question !  i think that the answer probably varies depending upon the particular therapist   in my work with people  once we have met and i have gotten an idea of the persona concerns and the issues they want help with  i spend the next few sessions gathering as much history and as much information about the clients current concerns in order to formulate some ideas about what may be causing distress  
 for myself i review policies and confidentiality concerns with people first and answer any questions they have then ill let them know ill be writing a lot in this session and i have an assessment form that i like to get completed but i want to have a conversation and ill ask questions as we go 
 this assessment is required by most insurances and allows the counselor to give a diagnosis which is also required by most insurances in order for them to pay the counselor  if you are paying out of pocket this diagnosis is not really required for payment but many counselors will still perform a comprehensive assessment because we really want to know what the issues are that brought you to us 
 the plan is not set in stone as things may arise during your therapy sessions  you also agree on how often and when you would like to meet 
the therapist will want to know your main source of life discomfort  in what areas are the problem interactions which you hope will disappear?the therapist is trained to listen for your emotions to your story

I am so glad you are able to start fighting the cancer again and keep it depleted and disappearing forever.
You have beaten your cancer put the issue of it back where it belongs and live your life....
If you would like to talk on the phone email me your number and I would be happy to call you.
No two people are alike and we all handle and heal differently.
Many of us here were diagnosed before age of 50
I am sad for your cousin still in disbelief that anyone these days can actually LOSE the fight to breast cancer!!!!!
Very sorry to read about your sister but so happy that she is going to be alright now.
Take your weary days and rest and find sources of strength and joy wherever that may be.
Your response is what it is just what you are feeling at this point in your treatment.
I respect your decision to refuse treatment I am sure Stayingcalm does also along with many others on this site.
You enjoy your very well deserved and very long dance with NED!
And even if it is cancer it can be treated.
Experiment until you find what is best for you.
Bringing cafe au lait and beignets and big hugs.
I hope this helps and again would be glad to talk .
My thoughts and prayers are with all the families.
Please dont apologize for they way you feel.
Stay warm  cozy now you deserve a rest I undersnad how it should feel!
Thanks for the update was hoping he was home by now my thoughts and prayers are still with you.
There are always trial drugs and something to try.
How very strong your friend must have been to endure all that in one month.
Instead you strike up an odd and sustaining friendship.
Remember to take good care of yourself and have a Happy New Year!
Miracles do happen some of us get it and some dont but life itself is a miracle right?
You have had a rough ride to travel Carol very rough.
Isnt it good to know that the person we are does not consist of the sum of our body parts?
i just want to say i feel so bad for every person in these rooms everyone with this fight with cancer.
I know how terrible this damn disease is but keep the battle and I know I and many others are praying hard for you.
That is wonderful you both were best friends.
I hope everything goes well for you and will remember you in my prayers.

It will serve you better NOT to own cancer for example its cancer or the cancer but not my cancer.

She sounds very sweet and loves her mama very much.
I know it is a hard road for you and hope for a positive response from this warden.
And I pray for strength  healing for you  him in the name of JESUS Amen.
Appears your mom is a strong fighting woman and this is real good .
I know chemo is horrible but you are almost done with it forever!

I think we all need to slow down and savor life!
Good luck to all of you and God bless you and your families.
Be aware that cancer isnt cancer until the pathologist sees it under the microscope.
A lot of us have been thru radiation so we will help you get thru it.

It is always disheartening to read of someone getting cancer again.
But it sounds like youre one heckuva strong lady
We are sooo glad that you found your way in here!
You made it thru chemo and you can make it thru radiation one treatment at a time.
Cancer patients are more likely to survive longer after diagnosis than those who have heart attacks or strokes.
That is so hard to do as we all know.
I concur with cobra  each of us handles our treatment differently.
Just breath and know that if this were a cancer it will have been caught very early and very curable.
I have so much respect for everyone who has fought this and won.
I just want you to know that many thoughts  prayers for strength are coming your way  and hugs hugs hugs!
You can always reconnect when youre feeling better!
Such good news that your lymph nodes were clean!
Pat wishing you the very best outcome tomorrow.

I was very sick from this chemo but just eat anything you can get into your system.
I was in your shoes several weeks ago.
I am so very sorry you are going thru this.
Thinking back to my lumpectomies I remember this happening.
Hope it is good news with the path report.

Hi  Im sorry to hear the bad news.
I pray that is all it is is a worry and you can be reassured with a check up by a qualified cancer Dr.
I will not give up my fight to beat this .Dont look back concentrate on the moment to move forward.
